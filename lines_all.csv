"01","01","Narrator ","It was way back in 2005. I was twenty-seven just starting to make it as an architect and living in New York with my friend Marshall, my best friend from college. My life was good and then Uncle Marshall went and screwed the whole thing up.",6,6
"01","01","Marshall ","(Opens ring) Will you marry me.",7,7
"01","01","Ted ","Yes, perfect! And then you're engaged, you pop the champagne! You drink a toast! You have s*x on the kitchen floor... Don't have s*x on our kitchen floor.",8,8

"01","01","Ted ","I did that one time.",20,20
"01","01","Barney ","It was a blazer!",21,21
"01","01","Ted ","You know, ever since college it's been Marshall and Lily and me. Now it's going to be Marshall and Lily... and me. They'll get married, start a family-before long I'm the weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call ""Uncle Ted"".",22,22
"01","01","Barney ","I see what this is about. Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met?",23,23
"01","01","Barney ","Ted, I'm going to teach you how to live. (Ted's shocked) Barney, we met at the urinal.",24,24

"01","01","Yasmine ","Thanks, It's Lebanese.",38,38
"01","01","Marshall ","Hey!",39,39

"01","01","Yasmine ","So do you think you'll ever get married?",48,48
"01","01","Ted ","Well maybe eventually. Some fall day. Possibly in Central Park. Simple ceremony, we'll write our own vows. But--eh--no DJ, people will dance. I'm not going to worry about it! Damn it, why did Marshall have to get engaged? (Yasmine laughs) Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh?",49,49
"01","01","Yasmine ","Actually, I think it's cute.",50,50
"01","01","Ted ","Well, you're clearly drunk (pulls her wine glass away. Hold up glass to bartender) ONE MORE FOR THE LADY!",51,51

"01","01","Ted ","Plus Marshall's found the love of his life. Even if I was ready, which I'm not, but if I was it's like, ""Okay, I'm ready! Where is she?"" (Spots Robin)",77,77
"01","01","Narrator ","and there she was.",78,78
"01","01","Narrator ","It was like something from an old movie. Where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor, turns to his buddy and says, ""see that girl? I'm going to marry her someday""",79,79

"01","01","Ted ","(nods) Oh.",89,89

"01","01","Lily ","The olive theory.",125,125
"01","01","Ted ","The olive theory is based on my friends, Marshall and Lily. He hates olives, she loves them. In a weird way that's what makes them such a great couple. A Perfect balance (eats olive).",126,126

"01","07","Barney ","What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?",55,1604
"01","07","Ellen ","That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.",56,1605
"01","07","Barney ","OK, Ted, let's go.",57,1606
"01","07","Ellen ","Not you, you stay.",58,1607
"01","07","Ellen ","You're cute. You're an architect. Good career and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application like your friend, Jack Package.",59,1608
"01","07","Barney (through office door) ","It's pronounced 'Pa-kojj.'",60,1609
"01","07","Ellen ","Get outta here!",61,1610
"01","07","Ellen ","You I can work with. You give me three days and I will find the woman you will marry.",62,1611
"01","07","Ted ","Ah, no thanks. I don't need an algorithm to meet women. It's New York City. You know, plenty of fish in the sea.",63,1612
"01","07","Ellen ","Plenty of fish in the sea. Yes, there's 9 million people in New York, 4.5 million women. Of course you wanna meet someone roughly your own age, let's say, plus minus 5 years. So if we take into account the most recent census data, that leaves us with 482,000. But, uh, wait",64,1613
"01","07","Ted ","That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?",65,1614
"01","07","Ellen ","There are 8 fish in that big, blue ocean, Ted. And if you feel confident that you can reel one into your boat without me, there's the door.",66,1615
"01","07","Ted ","Do you take credit cards?",67,1616
"01","07","Lily ","OK, it's back and this time we got a good look.",68,1617
"01","07","Barney ","Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that.",69,1618
"01","07","Marshall ","It's bigger now. It's been feeding.",70,1619
"01","07","Lily ","We were just upstairs watching TV.",71,1620
"01","07","Marshall ","Ah gosh.",72,1621
"01","07","Lily ","OK, let's do this.",73,1622
"01","07","Marshall ","Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over.",74,1623
"01","07","Barney ","So did you get a good look at it?",75,1624
"01","07","Lily ","Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton like a roach...",76,1625
"01","07","Marshall ","But it has mouse-like characteristics. Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail.",77,1626
"01","07","Robin ","So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?",78,1627
"01","07","Lily ","It's a cockamouse.",79,1628
"01","07","Robin ","What?",80,1629
"01","07","Lily ","It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know...",81,1630
"01","07","Barney ","Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha?",82,1631
"01","07","Robin ","That's impossible. That simply can't happen.",83,1632
"01","07","Lily ","Oh, but it can.",84,1633
"01","07","Marshall ","And it has",85,1634
"01","07","Lily ","And it's pissed.",86,1635
"01","07","Ted ","Dude, is everything OK? You left the front door open.",87,1636
"01","07","Marshall ","There was no time.",88,1637
"01","07","Robin ","So Love Solutions, did you meet the love of your life?",89,1638
"01","07","Ted ","She said it'd take three days. It's been five days. Should I be worried?",90,1639
"01","07","Lily ","Oh, just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.",91,1640
"01","07","Ted ","Did you just use my name as a verb?",92,1641
"01","07","Barney ","Oh, yeah, we do that behind your back. Ted-out: to overthink. Also see Ted-up. Ted-up: to overthink something with disastrous results. Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when",93,1642
"01","07","Ted ","OK, I get it. Don't worry, I'm not gonna ted anything up or out. I'll just give it a few more days.",94,1643
"01","07","Ted ","Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.",95,1644
"01","07","Ellen ","Ted, hi. I meant to call you. The computer is still crunching the numbers. Busy as a bee, that little computer.",96,1645
"01","07","Ted ","You said it was gonna be three days.",97,1646
"01","07","Ellen ","Did I?",98,1647
"01","07","Ted ","Hm.",99,1648
"01","07","Ellen ","Three days? Really?",100,1649
"01","07","Ted ","Yeah. When someone says you're gonna meet the perfect woman in three days, you gotta put that in your datebook, so...",101,1650
"01","07","Ellen ","How do I say this? This is gonna be really hard. Ted, there are absolutely no women out there for you. Phew, actually I got through that OK.",102,1651
"01","07","Ted ","There are no women for me out there? I thought you said there were 8.",103,1652
"01","07","Ellen ","I know. There are supposed to be. I don't know where they are.",104,1653
"01","07","Ted ","But, I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute. I'm a cute architect.",105,1654
"01","07","Ellen ","How do you think I feel? I have a 100% success rate. It's my hook. I could probably find somebody for you if you were gay.",106,1655
"01","07","Ted ","Well, I'm not.",107,1656
"01","07","Ellen ","A little bi maybe?",108,1657
"01","07","Ted ","No. You're messing with me, right?",109,1658
"01","07","Ellen ","Come see for yourself.",110,1659
"01","07","Ellen ","I cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 or higher, and look, 5.4, 4.8, 5.6...",111,1660
"01","07","Ted ","There's a 9.6 right there.",112,1661
"01","07","Ellen ","Don't touch the computer. Yes, Sarah O'Brien. I fixed her up six months ago. She would have been absolutely perfect for you.",113,1662
"01","07","Ted ","What about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?",114,1663
"01","07","Ellen ","8.5.",115,1664
"01","07","Ted ","So he sucks.",116,1665
"01","07","Ellen ","No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient.",117,1666
"01","07","Ted ","Oh, sure, it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?",118,1667
"01","07","Ellen ","Yes, 9.6 is off the charts, but Sarah is matched up. Ted, look, I have a lunch. Please. I promise we will find you somebody. Don't lose hope. There are new women turning 18 every day.",119,1668
"01","07","Lily ","He's a whole new species. The cockamouse.",120,1669
"01","07","Marshall ","And it's the size of a potato.",121,1670
"01","07","Robin ","So, what, now it's a cockapotatomouse?",122,1671
"01","07","Marshall ","Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cockamouse.",123,1672
"01","07","Ted ","My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.",124,1673
"01","07","Barney ","Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman.",125,1674
"01","07","Marshall ","And like the majestic seahorse it's hermaphroditic.",126,1675
"01","07","Lily ","Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.",127,1676
"01","07","Marshall ","For as much as we know about the cockamousse, there are still so much we don't know.",128,1677
"01","07","Robin ","Well, we know that there's no such thing as a cockamouse. What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking.",129,1678
"01","07","Marshall ","So you really don't believe in the cockamouse?",130,1679
"01","07","Robin ","Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know, um, like the Loch Ness Monster.",131,1680
"01","07","Marshall ","If by 'like the Loch Ness Monster,' you mean, totally exists and is awesome, then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster.",132,1681
"01","07","Marshall ","It's diet is not unlike our own, grains, cereals and it's awfully fond of cheese...",133,1682
"01","07","Ted ","OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin.",134,1683
"01","07","Barney ","You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny.",135,1684
"01","07","Ted ","All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?",136,1685
"01","07","Future Ted VO"," That's right, I did the math.",137,1686
"01","07","Ted ","Hi.",138,1687
"01","07","Sarah ","Hi, I'm Dr. O'Brien.",139,1688
"01","07","Ted ","I'm Architect Mosby. Sorry I just wanted to say my job too.",140,1689
"01","07","Ted ","Hi, I'm Ted.",141,1690
"01","07","Sarah ","So, what are we doing today?",142,1691
"01","07","Ted ","I have a kind of mole on my back. It's probably nothing but I'm a cautious guy.",143,1692
"01","07","Sarah ","I'm exactly the same.",144,1693
"01","07","Ted (singing) ","Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.",145,1694
"01","07","Sarah (joining in singing) ","Blowing through the jasmine in my mind.",146,1695
"01","07","Ted ","Sorry about that, Summer Breeze is my guilty pleasure song.",147,1696
"01","07","Ted ","Oh, it's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend at brunch.",148,1697
"01","07","Sarah ","I love brunch.",149,1698
"01","07","Ted ","It's the best, as long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies.",150,1699
"01","07","Sarah ","I like the way you think, Architect Mosby.",151,1700
"01","07","Ted ","Hey, this may sound weird but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off so I'm gonna ask you now. Do you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?",152,1701
"01","07","Sarah ","Oh, that's very sweet, but I'm actually getting married on Saturday.",153,1702
"01","07","Ted ","Friday night?",154,1703
"01","07","Ted ","Wow, you're getting married. Congratulations.",155,1704
"01","07","Sarah ","Thank you.",156,1705
"01","07","Ted ","I'm really sorry I asked you out. If just felt like there might be this weird connection between us. How crazy am I coming off here?",157,1706
"01","07","Sarah ","Only a little.",158,1707
"01","07","Ted ","Well, by some million to one shot, and I'm not rooting for this, you wind up not getting married this weekend, give me a call.",159,1708
"01","07","Sarah ","OK, but it's not likely. I look damn good in my dress.",160,1709
"01","07","Ted ","I'm sure you do.",161,1710
"01","07","Robin ","Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap. You think the road runner's gonna fall for it?",162,1711
"01","07","Lily ","OK, we get it. You're skeptical. But Marshall and I, we're believers. We believe.",163,1712
"01","07","Marshall ","Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome. You got the Bermuda triangle, ghosts, Big Foot.",164,1713
"01","07","Robin ","Bad maps. Creaky houses. Hillbilly in a gorilla suit.",165,1714
"01","07","Marshall ","Aliens.",166,1715
"01","07","Marshall ","Oh, come one, you gotta give me aliens. Stonehenge. Area 51. There's alien crap all over the place.",167,1716
"01","07","Robin ","You can't be serious.",168,1717
"01","07","Marshall ","My friend, you just poked the bear.",169,1718
"01","07","Ted ","So, my 9.6, beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged.",170,1719
"01","07","Robin ","Oh.",171,1720
"01","07","Lily ","Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.",172,1721
"01","07","Ted ","Yeah, it was a long shot. I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mine, but I don't know...",173,1722
"01","07","Lily ","Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.",174,1723
"01","07","Barney ","Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game.",175,1724
"01","07","Marshall ","On the night of July 2nd, 1947, conditions were clear over Roswell, New Mexico.",176,1725

"01","07","Marshall ","Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you. Dr. O'Brien.",178,1727

"01","07","Marshall ","When suddenly, an array of",180,1729

"01","07","Barney ","The doctor will see you now.",182,1731
"01","07","Ted ","What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?",183,1732
"01","07","Lily ","Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday.",184,1733
"01","07","Ted ","Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.",185,1734
"01","07","Barney ","(chuckles) Happy ending.",186,1735
"01","07","Ted ","Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a shot.",187,1736
"01","07","Barney ","All right, see you later. Happy hunting.",188,1737
"01","07","Lily ","Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse.",189,1738
"01","07","Barney ","Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles.",190,1739
"01","07","Marshall ","Oh my God!",191,1740
"01","07","Lily ","Holy crap. We got it! What do we do with it?",192,1741
"01","07","Marshall ","Calm down, I have a plan. I told my friend, Sudeep, about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department. But it has to be alive.",193,1742
"01","07","Lily ","Wait, no no. They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean. Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat?",194,1743
"01","07","Ted ","Hello again.",195,1744
"01","07","Sarah ","I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person.",196,1745
"01","07","Ted ","Go ahead, Sarah, you can tell me anything.",197,1746
"01","07","Sarah ","You have a basal cell carcinoma.",198,1747
"01","07","Ted ","Anything else?",199,1748
"01","07","Sarah ","Your mole. The biopsy came back. It's not life-threatening, but we should excise the rest of it.",200,1749
"01","07","Ted ","Wait, then you're still getting married.",201,1750
"01","07","Sarah ","Of course I'm still getting married.",202,1751
"01","07","Ted ","But we're a 9.6.",203,1752
"01","07","Sarah ","Excuse me.",204,1753

"01","07","Sarah ","You looked at my file.",206,1755
"01","07","Ted ","I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious? The woman who set you up with your fiancé thinks we're a better match.",207,1756
"01","07","Sarah ","I am getting married on Saturday.",208,1757
"01","07","Ted (singing) ","Summer breeze...",209,1758

"01","07","Ted ","Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?",211,1760
"01","07","Sarah ","Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you to proposition an engaged woman you don't even know?",212,1761
"01","07","Ted ","See, we're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other.",213,1762
"01","07","Sarah ","Ted, just calm down.",214,1763
"01","07","Ted ","Calm down! You're my only match! There was a computer and there were 8 fish in the sea full of lesbians.",215,1764
"01","07","Sarah ","Ted, Ted, do you honestly believe deep down that there is no one else out there for you just because some computer says so.",216,1765
"01","07","Ted ","Didn't used to. There was math, I got confused.",217,1766
"01","07","Sarah ","Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling. When you fall in love with someone, 8.5 equals a perfect 10.",218,1767
"01","07","Ted ","You're right.",219,1768
"01","07","Sudeep ","If this thing is what you say it is, it could be huge for my career.",220,1769

"01","08","Marshall ","Yeah, the building would have had to give you some sort of notice.",36,1838
"01","08","Waitress ","They sent you a notice about this.",37,1839
"01","08","Lily ","When?",38,1840
"01","08","Waitress ","Three months ago. Here's your mail minus the magazines.",39,1841
"01","08","Marshall ","Well, still, legally, they can't just toss you out onto the street. You have a lease.",40,1842
"01","08","Lily ","OK so I didn't have a written lease as such but, but go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy.",41,1843
"01","08","Lily ","She may be 98 years old but she's still...",42,1844
"01","08","Lily ","She's dead, isn't she?",43,1845
"01","08","Waitress ","Never even saw the bus.",44,1846
"01","08","Lily ","My apartment is a Chinese restaurant. What am I gonna do?",45,1847
"01","08","Ted ","Come live with us.",46,1848
"01","08","Lily ","Really?",47,1849
"01","08","Ted ","Of course.",48,1850
"01","08","Marshall ","You sure about this, Ted?",49,1851
"01","08","Ted ","Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything.",50,1852
"01","08","Barney ","No, it's like it'll change everything. Oh, Ted, you are so screwed.",51,1853
"01","08","Ted ","What? What are you talking about?",52,1854
"01","08","Robin ","And why is that girl checking you out?",53,1855
"01","08","Barney ","Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged",54,1856
"01","08","Ted ","Yeah, so?",55,1857
"01","08","Barney ","So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be?",56,1858
"01","08","Robin ","Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right?",57,1859
"01","08","Ted ","Yeah, we've talked about it.",58,1860
"01","08","Marshall ","So, when Lily and I get married, who's gonna get the apartment?",59,1861
"01","08","Ted ","Oh, that's a tough one. You know who I think could handle a problem like that?",60,1862
"01","08","Marshall ","Who?",61,1863
"01","08","Ted ","Future Ted and Future Marshall.",62,1864
"01","08","Marshall ","Totally. Let's let those guys handle it.",63,1865
"01","08","Ted ","Dammit Past Ted",64,1866
"01","08","Barney ","You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out.",65,1867
"01","08","Ted ","That's crazy. They're not edging me out. Marshall's my best friend.",66,1868
"01","08","Ted ","One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.",67,1869
"01","08","Barney ","Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment.",68,1870
"01","08","Robin ","Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?",69,1871
"01","08","Barney ","Sort of on a date with her.",70,1872
"01","08","Ted ","What?",71,1873
"01","08","Barney ","I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile. (evil laugh) But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.",72,1874
"01","08","Ted ","All right.",73,1875
"01","08","Robin ","You're going to the hospital?",74,1876
"01","08","Ted ","No, see, he's gonna go back over there and I'm gonna call him and he's gonna pretend that it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.",75,1877
"01","08","Robin ","Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney.",76,1878
"01","08","Barney ","Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck.",77,1879
"01","08","Robin ","So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?",78,1880
"01","08","Ted ","He's gonna want the apartment. I'm gonna want the apartment. It's gonna lead to an argument, so no.",79,1881
"01","08","Robin ","Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it.",80,1882
"01","08","Ted ","I should really make this call.",81,1883
"01","08","Robin ","Ooh, can I do it?",82,1884
"01","08","Barney ","Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy.",83,1885
"01","08","Barney ","Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?",84,1886
"01","08","Robin ","Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff.",85,1887
"01","08","Barney ","An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy.",86,1888
"01","08","Barney ","Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?",87,1889
"01","08","Robin ","Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.",88,1890
"01","08","Barney ","Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there.",89,1891
"01","08","Barney ","See you guys later.",90,1892
"01","08","Ted ","Ah, this'll be nice, the three of us living together. I think it's a good setup.",91,1893
"01","08","Ted ","Man, this coffee's great. It's really great. Too great.",92,1894
"01","08","Ted ","What happened to Shocky?",93,1895
"01","08","Ted ","What's this? Lily: My coffeemaker from my apartment. Makes great coffee, right?",94,1896
"01","08","Ted ","Yeah, definitely. I mean, so does Shocky.",95,1897
"01","08","Marshall ","Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kinda rusty.",96,1898
"01","08","Ted ","Yeah, no, it did. I mean, I kinda liked the rusty taste. I'm used to it. I don't know.",97,1899
"01","08","Marshall ","Also Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock you.",98,1900
"01","08","Ted ","No. You gotta admit, that shock, wakes you up in the morning",99,1901
"01","08","Marshall ","You know what else wakes you up in the morning? Coffee.",100,1902
"01","08","Ted ","That's great. You're right. Roomies! I love it.",101,1903
"01","08","Ted ","They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.",102,1904
"01","08","Barney ","Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.",103,1905
"01","08","Robin ","Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she!",104,1906
"01","08","Ted ","It's not just the coffeemaker.",105,1907
"01","08","Lily ","Done. The painting's done.",106,1908
"01","08","Marshall ","That is great.",107,1909
"01","08","Ted ","Nice.",108,1910
"01","08","Marshall ","Where do you wanna hang it?",109,1911
"01","08","Lily ","I don't know. Um, over the piano?",110,1912
"01","08","Ted ","Yeah, that would be a good place for it. Too bad the swords are there. We kinda love those swords.",111,1913
"01","08","Marshall ","Well, those swords have been up there a long time.",112,1914
"01","08","Ted ","I know, right? I'd really miss them too. So, maybe Marshall's room?",113,1915
"01","08","Lily ","OK.",114,1916
"01","08","Ted ","He was gonna take the swords down. Can you believe that?",115,1917
"01","08","Robin ","Ted, why don't you just talk to him? He's your best friend.",116,1918
"01","08","Robin ","One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.",117,1919
"01","08","Barney ","Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike.",118,1920
"01","08","Ted ","Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?",119,1921
"01","08","Barney ","You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big.",120,1922
"01","08","Ted ","What, like buy a new sofa?",121,1923
"01","08","Barney ","Bigger.",122,1924
"01","08","Barney ","Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law.",123,1925
"01","08","Robin ","A lemon law, like for cars.",124,1926
"01","08","Barney ","Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now.",125,1927
"01","08","Barney ","Hi Katie. Barney.",126,1928
"01","08","Katie ","Hi, it's good to finally meet you.",127,1929
"01","08","Barney ","Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.",128,1930
"01","08","Barney (yelling to Katie as she leaves) ","Tell your friends.",129,1931
"01","08","Barney (to Robin and Ted at other table) ","It's gonna be a thing.",130,1932
"01","08","Lily ","Man, Ted's been acting weird. He started labeling all his food. He even carved ""Ted"" into that block of cheese.",131,1933
"01","08","Marshall ","Yeah. Well, now it's Ed's.",132,1934
"01","08","Lily ","He's not cool with me moving in.",133,1935
"01","08","Marshall ","No, that's not it. I mean, you basically lived here all along. Ted loves you.",134,1936
"01","08","Lily ","So, what's he PMS'ing about?",135,1937
"01","08","Marshall ","I don't know. But when he's ready to talk to me about it he'll come and talk to me about it.",136,1938
"01","08","Lily ","Are you kidding? You guys never talk about anything.",137,1939
"01","08","Lily ","He'll just let it fester under the surface until he does something big and passive-aggressive.",138,1940
"01","08","Marshall ","You clearly don't know Ted.",139,1941
"01","08","Delivery guy"," Delivery for Ted Mosby.",140,1942
"01","08","Marshall ","Your English phone booth arrived.",141,1943
"01","08","Ted ","Oh, awesome. It's great, right?",142,1944
"01","08","Marshall ","Yeah, I guess. Just not sure if Lily's gonna like it.",143,1945
"01","08","Ted ","Well, I like it, so I'm just gonna keep it right here, if that's cool.",144,1946
"01","08","Marshall ","Of course, we all live here so we should all be able to have things the way we want them.",145,1947
"01","08","Ted ","Exactly.",146,1948
"01","08","Marshall ","Great",147,1949
"01","08","Marshall ","Terrific.",148,1950
"01","08","Marshall ","You like the phone booth. It stays. I like this painting so I'm just gonna hang it...right here on the wall.",149,1951
"01","08","Ted ","Oh, so it's like that, is it?",150,1952
"01","08","Marshall ","Bring, bring.",151,1953
"01","08","Marshall (in British accent) ","Oh hello governor, oh it's like isn't it? Cheerio.",152,1954
"01","08","Marshall ","Yeah, it's like that.",153,1955
"01","08","Ted ","I want this apartment.",154,1956
"01","08","Marshall ","Well, I want it too.",155,1957
"01","08",NA,"Girl #2: You're a jerk.",156,1958
"01","08","Barney ","No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing!",157,1959
"01","08","Robin ","For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society.",158,1960
"01","08","Barney ","No, wrong, lemon law is awesome.",159,1961
"01","08","Robin ","It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great.",160,1962
"01","08","Barney ","OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy.",161,1963
"01","08","Barney ","You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?",162,1964
"01","08","Robin ","Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate.",163,1965
"01","08","Barney ","Bad move, Scherbatsky.",164,1966
"01","08","Barney ","Hi, have you met Robin?",165,1967
"01","08","Kevin ","Hi.",166,1968
"01","08","Robin ","Hi.",167,1969
"01","08","Ted ","All right Marshall, we're deciding right now who gets this apartment. It may lead to an argument, but we're settling this.",168,1970
"01","08","Marshall ","Or we could flip a coin.",169,1971
"01","08","Ted ","Yeah, let's flip a coin.",170,1972
"01","08","Marshall ","Flip it.",171,1973
"01","08","Ted ","OK, I'm flipping it, here I go.",172,1974
"01","08","Marshall ","Flip it.",173,1975
"01","08","Ted ","OK, here I go.",174,1976
"01","08","Marshall ","Flip it.",175,1977
"01","08","Ted ","I'm flipping. But before I do, I just wanna say something. You didn't even wanna move in here in the first place. You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies.",176,1978
"01","08","Marshall ","That was five years ago. Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter. Oh snap. What else you got?",177,1979
"01","08","Ted ","OK, I'm flipping. Heads or tails.",178,1980
"01","08","Marshall ","You don't need two rooms",179,1981
"01","08","Ted ","Heads or tails, Marshall. Like you need two rooms?",180,1982
"01","08","Marshall ","We might be starting a family soon.",181,1983
"01","08","Ted ","Oh, no you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're in law school. It's gonna be at least three years.",182,1984
"01","08","Marshall ","It could be sooner, we're not that careful with our birth control Two-zip.",183,1985
"01","08","Ted ","Oh, come on, you know damn well I move out that room's going unused.",184,1986
"01","08","Marshall ","Oh, and I suppose you'll get a new roommate? Who's it gonna be? Barney? You know he cooks naked.",185,1987
"01","08","Ted ","Yeah, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the swords down.",186,1988
"01","08","Ted ","We were bros! These swords represent our bro-hood. And you took 'em down to make room for your fiance's stupid painting?",187,1989
"01","08","Marshall ","My fiancé...suddenly, she's my fiancé.",188,1990
"01","08",NA,"(Marshall picks up other sword) Marshall: Lily's a part of who I am. And if you're such a bro, she's a part of who you are too. She's a bro by extension.",189,1991
"01","08","Ted ","I deserve this apartment, Marshall.",190,1992
"01","08","Marshall ","No more than I do.",191,1993
"01","08","Ted ","Great, so let's flip for it.",192,1994
"01","08","Marshall ","Flip it.",193,1995
"01","08","Ted ","So, is this how we're deciding who gets the apartment?",194,1996
"01","08","Marshall ","I guess so.",195,1997
"01","08","Ted ","How are we doing this exactly? Is this like to the death?",196,1998
"01","08","Marshall ","We should probably figure that out.",197,1999
"01","08","Ted ","It's OK, it's OK.",198,2000
"01","08","Ted ","Can I observe something?",199,2001
"01","08","Marshall ","That this is kinda awesome?",200,2002
"01","08","Ted ","Totally.",201,2003
"01","08","Marshall ","I can't believe we didn't do this before.",202,2004
"01","08","Ted ","I know!",203,2005
"01","08","Robin ","Thank you.",204,2006
"01","08","Kevin ","I can't believe this. I'm sitting here with a beautiful woman I just met eating at my favorite restaurant. Sweet.",205,2007
"01","08","Robin ","It's a nice place. It's good to know the future has ribs.",206,2008
"01","08","Kevin ","In the future food will most likely be served in gel-cap form. Plus cows will probably have died out by then... or be our leaders.",207,2009
"01","08","Robin ","Just a second.",208,2010
"01","08","Robin ","Hello.",209,2011
"01","08","Barney ","(laughs) Time's running out, Scherbatsky. Last chance for the lemon law.",210,2012
"01","08","Robin ","Leave me alone.",211,2013

"01","08","Robin ","We're only just getting to know each other.",213,2015
"01","08","Barney ","Say I'm right and this could all be over. This could be your call from the hospital.",214,2016
"01","08","Robin ","Sorry.",215,2017
"01","08","Kevin ","Let me guess, there's been a crazy accident and you have to go.",216,2018
"01","08","Robin ","No, I would never do that. I don't wanna go anywhere. I'm all yours.",217,2019
"01","08","Kevin ","Look, if you're a hooker, I don't have a lot of money.",218,2020
"01","08","Marshall ","That was awesome.",219,2021
"01","08","Ted ","I know.",220,2022
"01","08","Marshall ","Do it again.",221,2023
"01","08","Ted ","OK, but this time, jump up and I'll swipe your legs.",222,2024
"01","08","Ted ","Look. Here's why I should get the place. You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates. And on top of that I could be homeless. Does that seem fair?",223,2025
"01","08","Marshall ","Oh, boo-freakin-hoo.",224,2026
"01","08","Ted ","What?",225,2027
"01","08","Marshall ","Woe is me. I'm not married yet. My ovaries are shrinking. Ted, if you wanted to be married by now you would be but you're not. And you know why? Because you're irrationally picky. You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.",226,2028
"01","08","Ted ","Anhedonic?",227,2029
"01","08","Marshall ","Anhedonic. It means you can't enjoy anything.",228,2030
"01","08","Ted ","The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this.",229,2031
"01","08","Marshall ","I know, this rules.",230,2032
"01","08","Marshall ","Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down.",231,2033
"01","08","Ted ","That's OK, it led to this totally rad sword fight, didn't it?",232,2034
"01","08","Marshall ","Yeah it did.",233,2035
"01","08","Marshall ","You remember when we first got these swords?",234,2036
"01","08","Ted ","It was the day we moved in.",235,2037
"01","08","Ted ","Congratulations, Marshall. We live in an apartment with swords on the wall.",236,2038
"01","08","Marshall ","List of lifelong dreams, you're not half as long. Crap. I'm missing one of the screws for this table",237,2039
"01","08","Ted ","Just use this wood glue, it'll hold.",238,2040
"01","08","Marshall ","Yeah.",239,2041
"01","08","Robin ","Oh God, I'll be right there.",240,2042
"01","08","Robin ","Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go. My friend's been stabbed with a sword.",241,2043
"01","08","Kevin ","Hab slosi quch! You have no honor. You know, if you felt this way you could have just been upfront.",242,2044
"01","08","Robin ","No, I swear that was a real call. I just...Oh forget it.",243,2045
"01","08","Marshall ","I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fiancé.",244,2046
"01","08","Ted ","Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fiancé? I'm kidding. Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment. Marshall: But you fought so bravely for it.",245,2047
"01","08","Ted ","I wasn't fighting for the apartment. I was fighting for...I don't know...for everything to stay the way it is. But I'm not gonna get that, so, seriously, take the place, it's yours.",246,2048
"01","08","Robin ","Is she OK?",247,2049
"01","08","Marshall ","They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine.",248,2050
"01","08","Barney ","So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie.",249,2051
"01","08","Barney ","What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie.",250,2052
"01","08","Barney ","Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O.",251,2053
"01","08","Jackie ","Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to lemon law you.",252,2054
"01","08","Barney ","It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law.",253,2055
"01","08","Robin ","But you're totally...",254,2056
"01","08","Ted ","Just let him have this one.",255,2057
"01","08","Doctor ","All set. She said she'd like to see the knights of the poorly constructed round table?",256,2058
"01","08","Marshall ","That's us.",257,2059
"01","08","Lily ","A sword fight?",258,2060

"01","08","Lily ","On Monday, I'm gonna have to tell my kindergarten class who I teach not to run with scissors that my fiancé ran me through with a frickin' broad sword.",260,2062
"01","08","Marshall ","Well, just to be fair, it didn't go all the way through.",261,2063
"01","08","Lily ","I'm sorry, is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me?",262,2064
"01","08","Marshall ","You're right. I'm sorry. We were fighting to see who gets the apartment. And I won.",263,2065
"01","08","Ted ","Uh, you didn't win. I gave it to you.",264,2066
"01","08","Marshall ","Uh, you know, if I tried...",265,2067
"01","08","Lily ","Wait wait wait wait wait. I don't want that apartment. It's a boy apartment. It's full of swords and videogames, and kinda smells like dude. It's fine for now, but when we get married, I wanna start a new life with you in a new place.",266,2068
"01","08","Marshall ","Gonna miss the old place.",267,2069
"01","08","Lily ","I will too. We're not getting married for like a year.",268,2070
"01","08","Ted ","Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem. Let that guy deal with it.",269,2071
"01","08","Marshall ","Totally.",270,2072
"01","08","Lily ","Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking but I'm starving.",271,2073

"01","12","Ted ","Here, Lily, you answer it.",151,3071
"01","12","Lily ","What? Why?",152,3072
"01","12","Ted ","Because this whole thing was your idea. And Claudia scares me.",153,3073

"01","13","Ted ","I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.",81,3275
"01","13","Victoria ","OK, how about this? The best part of any first-kiss is the lead-up to it, the moment right before the lips touch. It's like a big drumroll. So, how about, tonight, we just stick with the drumroll.",82,3276
"01","13","Ted ","OK.",83,3277
"01","13","Victoria ","But we can't kiss.",84,3278
"01","13","Ted ","OK.",85,3279
"01","13","Marshall ","A drumroll? That's it. So, what, you just said good-night, came home, and performed a drum solo?",86,3280
"01","13","Lily ","Oh, Ted, you're such a doof. I mean, this girl sounds amazing.",87,3281
"01","13","Ted ","She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and we connected on every level. And, I'm never gonna see her again.",88,3282
"01","13","Ted ","Dammit, I have to see her again.",89,3283
"01","13",NA,"Lily, Marshall: Yes.",90,3284
"01","13","Marshall ","So, let's get to work, man. What else do you know about her?",91,3285
"01","13","Ted ","Nothing. Her name's Victoria, that's all I got. Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know.",92,3286
"01","13","Lily ","Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon. She'll be back in two weeks. Call her then.",93,3287
"01","13","Ted ","Yes, two weeks, good idea. I'm calling her now.",94,3288
"01","13","Lily ","No, Ted, you don't mess with a honeymoon.",95,3289
"01","13","Marshall ","Yeah, come on, dude. Ask her about the cake.",96,3290
"01","13","Claudia ","Ted?",97,3291
"01","13",NA,"(Ted on phone in his apartment) Ted: Hey, Claudia, great wedding, beautiful toast, touching stuff. How's the honeymoon? Listen, I'm calling because last night I met this girl and I was wondering if you had...",98,3292
"01","13","Claudia ","Oh, you have got to be freakin kidding me.",99,3293
"01","13","Stuart ","Oh, here we go.",100,3294
"01","13","Claudia ","24 hours ago, you were begging, begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding, and now, what, you're over her?",101,3295
"01","13","Ted ","I've moved on.",102,3296
"01","13","Claudia ","What was her name? Was it my fat cousin, Lindsay? Don't be embarrassed. She has pretty eyes.",103,3297
"01","13","Ted ","Uh, no, her name was Victoria, I don't know her last name.",104,3298
"01","13","Claudia ","Well, lucky for you, I know that guest list backwards and forwards.",105,3299
"01","13","Ted ","Thank God.",106,3300
"01","13","Claudia ","Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria at my wedding. Good-bye, Ted.",107,3301
"01","13","Ted ","There was no Victoria at the wedding.",108,3302
"01","13","Lily ","Maybe she used a second fake name. Oh, she's good, she's very good.",109,3303
"01","13","Marshall ","Maybe she was a ghost. That's why she didn't wanna kiss you, because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second. Oh my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay.",110,3304
"01","13","Ted ","Marshall. She was not a ghost.",111,3305
"01","13","Marshall ","I know that she wasn't a ghost, she picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form.",112,3306
"01","13","Ted ","Wait, wait, wait, she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids. She must have been at their table. Maybe they know who she was?",113,3307
"01","13","Lily ","Great. How do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?",114,3308
"01","13","Barney ","This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what?",115,3309
"01","13","Nirvana ","Barney.",116,3310
"01","13","Barney ","Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste.",117,3311
"01","13","Ted ","Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?",118,3312
"01","13","Barney ","You know I did.",119,3313
"01","13","Ted ","Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me.",120,3314
"01","13","Barney ","You know I won't.",121,3315
"01","13","Ted ","Why not?",122,3316
"01","13","Barney ","Because we just hooked up last night. I can't call the girl the next day. I have to wait at least, like, forever. Oh snap. Never gonna call her. Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.",123,3317
"01","13","Lily ","Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.",124,3318
"01","13","Barney ","Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night.",125,3319
"01","13","Ted ","OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.",126,3320
"01","13","Barney ","Really? Ted: Yeah.",127,3321
"01","13","Barney ","But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing.",128,3322
"01","13","Ted ","I'm ready to be proven wrong.",129,3323
"01","13","Barney ","Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial.",130,3324
"01","13","Barney ","(on phone) Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.",131,3325
"01","13","Barney ","(to Ted) What kind of shoes...",132,3326
"01","13","Barney ","(on phone) Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing.",133,3327
"01","13","Ted ","Actually.",134,3328
"01","13","Barney ","Oh come on.",135,3329
"01","13","Victoria ","Hey.",136,3330
"01","13","Ted ","So, what do you want to do next?",137,3331
"01","13","Victoria ","Uh...",138,3332
"01","13","Ted ","Don't think...first thing that comes into your mind.",139,3333
"01","13","Victoria ","Hold this.",140,3334
"01","13","Ted ","Whoa. There she goes.",141,3335
"01","13","Barney ","(on phone) Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them.",142,3336
"01","13","Barney ","Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight.",143,3337
"01","13","Ted ","I understand.",144,3338
"01","13","Lily ","OK, let's not lose hope. We'll call the hotel, maybe she was staying there. We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria. Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...",145,3339
"01","13","Marshall ","Or Ictor. Probably doesn't go by Ictor.",146,3340
"01","13","Ted ","No, you know what? This is fate. I am never supposed to see this girl again. That was the whole point of the night. I've just been saved from myself. Let's drink many beers.",147,3341
"01","13","Marshall ","Agreed.",148,3342
"01","13","Future Ted VO"," And I thought that was the end of it, but then...",149,3343
"01","13","Lily ","Hey, there's the anchor lady! How was it?",150,3344
"01","13","Robin ","Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor. Robin? Thanks, Robin, it was awesome. Back to you, Robin.",151,3345
"01","13","Lily ","Congrats, that's so cool.",152,3346
"01","13","Robin ","Yeah, I felt really bad bailing on Ted though.",153,3347
"01","13","Lily ","Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...",154,3348
"01","13","Future Ted VO"," And then Lily told her the whole story, right down to the brown shoes with the little snowflakes on them, and by the end of it...",155,3349
"01","13","Lily ","What?",156,3350
"01","13","Robin ","I know who she is.",157,3351
"01","13","Lily ","You know who she is? But, you weren't even at the wedding.",158,3352
"01","13","Robin ","Actually, I kind of was.",159,3353
"01","13","Lily ","What?",160,3354
"01","13","Robin ","Well, after the newscast, I was so excited, I decided to surprise Ted by going to the reception.",161,3355
"01","13","Robin ","Dammit. Stop it. What the hell?",162,3356
"01","13","Victoria ","Hello? You OK in there?",163,3357
"01","13","Robin ","Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just allergies or something. I'm fine.",164,3358
"01","13","Victoria ","Listen, do you wanna come and cry out here? I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.",165,3359
"01","13","Robin ","Oh, thanks, but I don't actually cry in front of people, or cry at all for that matter. Man, it's gross. Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?",166,3360
"01","13","Victoria ","Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter. So, why are you crying?",167,3361
"01","13","Lily ","Because you have feelings for Ted.",168,3362
"01","13","Robin ","I don't know, maybe.",169,3363
"01","13","Lily ","OK, what is wrong with the two of you?! Seriously. He likes you and you like him, just, just, just be together. Geez, Louise, happiness is not that difficult.",170,3364
"01","13","Robin ","Oh, look, OK. Yes, I cried in the bathroom, and that was weird. But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy. The fact is I don't know how I feel.",171,3365
"01","13","Lily ","Yes you do. Seeing him with someone else and crying about it. Guess what? That's how you feel. That is nothing but how you feel.",172,3366
"01","13","Robin ","OK, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy? Lily: Kinda, yeah.",173,3367
"01","13","Robin ","But it doesn't change anything. I still don't wanna get married and he's still... Ted. What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he could be happy.",174,3368
"01","13","Lily ","Or you could tell him you're into him and then you could both be happy.",175,3369
"01","13","Robin ","I'm gonna go find him.",176,3370
"01","13","Lily ","Well, wait. Which one are you gonna tell him?",177,3371
"01","13","Robin ","I have no idea.",178,3372
"01","13","Barney ","And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for s*x.",179,3373
"01","13","Barney ","I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.",180,3374
"01","13","Robin ","Hi, guys,",181,3375
"01","13","Ted ","Hey.",182,3376
"01","13","Robin ","Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?",183,3377
"01","13","Ted ","Sure. What's up?",184,3378
"01","13","Robin ","Uh, I, I have to tell you something.",185,3379
"01","13","Ted ","Oh.",186,3380
"01","13","Robin ","Oh, just get it.",187,3381
"01","13","Ted ","Hello.",188,3382
"01","13","Stuart ","Ted, it's Stuart. My lovely bride would like to say something to you.",189,3383
"01","13","Claudia ","Ted. I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier. My new husband and a vodka cranberry which cost $10.50 at the freakin' airport bar. When is this plane going to board?!",190,3384
"01","13","Stuart ","Sweet pea.",191,3385
"01","13","Claudia ","Have helped me realize that sometimes I can act like a crazy person. And I don't want my new husband to think I'm a crazy person.",192,3386
"01","13","Ted ","It's fine, Claudia. Don't worry about it.",193,3387
"01","13","Ted ","Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake.",194,3388
"01","13","Claudia ","Cake.",195,3389
"01","13","Victoria ","Why don't you take this? Sounds like you could use it.",196,3390
"01","13","Robin ","Thanks. You're very sweet. So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?",197,3391
"01","13","Claudia ","We got it at this little bakery downtown.",198,3392
"01","13","Victoria ","Actually, neither.",199,3393
"01","13","Claudia ","It's called the Buttercup Bakery.",200,3394
"01","13","Victoria ","I made the cake.",201,3395
"01","13","Ted ","She made the cake.",202,3396
"01","13","Ted ","Buttercup Bakery. She wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest. She made the cake.",203,3397
"01","13","Marshall ","She made that cake. Ted, this is the girl. You gotta marry her, today. She has to move in with us.",204,3398
"01","13","Ted ","I'm going down to that bakery.",205,3399
"01","13","Lily ","No, no, don't do it.",206,3400
"01","13","Marshall ","Baby, what are you talking about?!",207,3401
"01","13","Ted ","Yeah, all day long, you've been busting my apple bag about finding this girl.",208,3402
"01","13","Lily ","Well, I just think that maybe she's not that into you and that's why she didn't give you her number. Robin, care to chime in with anything? Robin: Yes. Ted. Go get her.",209,3403
"01","13","Ted ","Going. Getting.",210,3404
"01","13","Barney ","Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up!",211,3405
"01","13","Ted ","Yes! No.",212,3406
"01","13","Barney ","Oh come on!",213,3407
"01","13","Ted ","Whoa. Guess we were gone a while.",214,3408
"01","13","Victoria ","Well, that's too bad. I was looking forward to one last dance.",215,3409
"01","13","Ted ","Why yes I am. Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking.",216,3410
"01","13","Victoria ","Wow, what was I thinking?",217,3411
"01","13","Ted ","Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.",218,3412
"01","13","Victoria ","You got me, you are good.",219,3413
"01","13","Ted ","You know, I don't look like this every day. On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.",220,3414
"01","13","Victoria ","The real Ted sounds real sexy. It's too bad I'll never get to see it.",221,3415
"01","13","Lily ","Buttercup Bakery. This is it.",222,3416
"01","13","Marshall ","Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.",223,3417
"01","13","Barney ","Ted, you still with us?",224,3418
"01","13","Ted ","Tell me your last name.",225,3419
"01","13","Ted ","You know, there's one little flaw in our plan.",226,3420
"01","13","Victoria ","What's that?",227,3421
"01","13","Ted ","I'm gonna go home tonight with a lot of great memories and one really sucky memory: the memory of you walking out that door.",228,3422
"01","13","Victoria ","Hey, Ted.",229,3423
"01","13","Ted ","Yeah?",230,3424
"01","13","Victoria ","Close your eyes, and count to five.",231,3425
"01","13","Ted ","One, two, three, four, five.",232,3426
"01","13","Ted ","And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be...",233,3427
"01","13","Barney ","The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot.",234,3428
"01","13","Ted ","OK.",235,3429
"01","13","Victoria ","Oh thank God.",236,3430
"01","14",NA,"Ted from 2030: When you meet someone special, suddenly life is full of firsts. The first kiss. The first night together. The first weekend together. For me, all those firsts happened within 48 hours of meeting Victoria.",1,3431
"01","14","Marshall ","They have to come out soon, it's Monday.",2,3432
"01","14","Lily ","Do you think they've been in there the whole time? I don't know whether to be proud or concerned.",3,3433
"01","14","Marshall ","Maybe they're not even in there.",4,3434
"01","14","Victoria ","Good morning.",5,3435
"01","14","Ted ","Hey, guys.",6,3436
"01","14","Victoria ","I'm just going to ignore that.",7,3437
"01","14","Marshall ","Thank you!",8,3438
"01","14","Ted ","I wish you could stay.",9,3439
"01","14","Victoria ","I know, me, too. But I have to go to work, and you have that meeting.",10,3440
"01","14","Ted ","Call you afterwards?",11,3441
"01","14","Victoria ","I'll inappropriately text you during. Bye.",12,3442
"01","14","Ted ","Bye.",13,3443
"01","14","Marshall ","Two days straight?!",14,3444
"01","14","Lily ","Wow, your room must smell like a monkey cage!",15,3445
"01","14","Marshall ","Come on, give us a number. Lily guessed eight, but I know my boy got to double digits.",16,3446
"01","14","Ted ","Zero.",17,3447
"01","14","Marshall ","What?",18,3448
"01","14","Lily ","What?",19,3449
"01","14","Ted ","Guys, we just met. And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick, so we talked about it, and we decided to take this one slow.",20,3450
"01","14","Marshall ","Her idea.",21,3451
"01","14","Ted ","Totally her idea! But, I don't know, I'm really into this girl, and if going slow is what it takes to make this happen, I say bring it on.",22,3452
"01","14","Ted ","I don't feel so good. t's like my testicles mixed pop rocks and soda.",23,3453
"01","14","Marshall ","I can't believe she's making you wait a whole month. I would never put up with that.",24,3454
"01","14","Ted ","You've only had s*x with one girl in your whole life.",25,3455
"01","14","Lily ","Burn!",26,3456
"01","14","Barney ","Ted, the only reason to wait a month for s*x is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.",27,3457
"01","14","Robin ","Good news: I don't have to cover the cat show tomorrow night. Who's up for hanging out?",28,3458
"01","14","Ted ","Oh, I can't, I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.",29,3459
"01","14","Lily ","No, no, we can't, it's our nine-year anniversary.",30,3460
"01","14","Robin ","Wow, nine years? Your relationship's a fourth grader. Congrats.",31,3461
"01","14","Lily ","Thanks. We're going to the Berkshires for the maple syrup harvest.",32,3462
"01","14","Marshall ","It's one of New York Magazine's ""Top five romantic getaways on a budget."" Who says sexual can't be sensible?",33,3463
"01","14","Robin ","Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me.",34,3464
"01","14","Barney ","Really?",35,3465
"01","14","Robin ","Actually, I was talking to my martini.",36,3466
"01","14","Marshall ","Ready to go?",37,3467
"01","14","Lily ","Hell, yeah. Nothing better than a weekend at a good bed and breakfast.",38,3468
"01","14","Marshall ","Yeah. Waking up for breakfast at 7:00 A.M....Sharp.",39,3469
"01","14","Lily ","Complimenting the odors and their collection of needle-point geese.",40,3470
"01","14","Marshall ","Awkward conversations with middle-aged couples trying to stave off divorce.",41,3471
"01","14","Lily ","Yeah, well, we'd better get going, it's like a four-hour drive.",42,3472
"01","14","Marshall ","And it's supposed to rain tonight.",43,3473
"01","14","Lily ","Or we could just stay home.",44,3474
"01","14","Marshall ","Maybe watch some TV.",45,3475
"01","14","Lily ","Order in some Chinese.",46,3476
"01","14","Marshall ","Oh, Sichuan Garden! Are we really bailing?",47,3477
"01","14","Lily ","Hell, yeah.",48,3478
"01","14","Marshall ","Good, cause this thing's empty.",49,3479
"01","14","Barney ","Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say ""wow.""",50,3480
"01","14","Robin ","Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident.",51,3481
"01","14","Barney ","It's one of the many risks of the blind approach. It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot. But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.",52,3482
"01","14","Robin ","Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?",53,3483
"01","14","Barney ","You can't just... Wow!",54,3484
"01","14","Robin ","Hey? What's taking so long? I have to go.",55,3485
"01","14","Barney ","Not so fast, Scherbotsky. I like the way you think. That mirror thing. Simple. Elegant. Okay, limited-time offer: I need a ""bro"" for my bro-ings on about town. How would you like to be said bro?",56,3486
"01","14","Robin ","Well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped. She really needs some support... or a stranger's tongue down her throat. That seems healthy. All right. Guess I'm in.",57,3487
"01","14","Victoria ","So... one more week and it'll be a month.",58,3488
"01","14","Ted ","Really? Are you sure? Wow, that snuck up on me.",59,3489
"01","14","Victoria ","Oh, come on.",60,3490
"01","14","Ted ","The 18th can't get here fast enough.",61,3491
"01","14","Victoria ","Wait, the 18th? Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this... I'm going to be out of town on the 18th!",62,3492
"01","14","Ted ","Oh. Well, um, we can just... wait until you get back. I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this.",63,3493
"01","14","Victoria ","Yeah. Or we could do it tonight.",64,3494
"01","14","Ted ","75th and Amsterdam.",65,3495
"01","14","Lily ","I'm so glad we decided to just stay home.",66,3496
"01","14","Marshall ","Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone? We'd be just getting there now, all tired and cranky.",67,3497
"01","14","Lily ","And yet we'd feel obligated to have s*x.",68,3498
"01","14","Marshall ","Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it. I would like to propose a toast. To the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever.",69,3499
"01","14","Ted ","I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend.",70,3500
"01","14","Victoria ","I'm so glad your roommates are out of town.",71,3501
"01","14","Lily ","Oh, my God, what are they doing home?",72,3502
"01","14","Marshall ","They think we went away. Oh, it is on for my boy, Ted.",73,3503
"01","14","Lily ","But we didn't go away, we're in the bathroom.",74,3504
"01","14","Marshall ","They don't know that. All we have to do is hide out in here until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom.",75,3505
"01","14","Lily ","But I don't want to hide out in here.",76,3506
"01","14","Marshall ","Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this. If we go out there and spoil the mood, it's not going to happen. Then one of us is going to have to have s*x with Ted, and... not going to be me.",77,3507
"01","14","Lily ","Okay, fine. I guess I'll actually floss.",78,3508
"01","14","Barney ","You suited up!",79,3509
"01","14","Robin ","Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right.",80,3510
"01","14","Barney ","Emilio? The woman will have...",81,3511
"01","14","Robin ","I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks.",82,3512
"01","14","Barney ","Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. ""The Torpedo."" Or, as the rollers call it, ""Piramide.""",83,3513
"01","14","Robin ","My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention.",84,3514
"01","14","Barney ","Father issues. Hot.",85,3515
"01","14","Robin ","I know... I was this close to being a huge slut.",86,3516
"01","14","Barney ","Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl.",87,3517
"01","14","Robin ","Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have s*x to get pregnant.",88,3518
"01","14","Barney ","What up! Freeze frame high five!",89,3519
"01","14","Victoria ","I think this may be a perfect moment. I wish we could hold onto it forever.",90,3520
"01","14","Ted ","No. Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting. By its very nature, it... slips through our fingers... making it that much more precious.",91,3521
"01","14","Lily ","Ugh, that is bad. That is, like, high-school-literary-magazine bad.",92,3522
"01","14","Marshall ","And they're not even high.",93,3523
"01","14","Lily ","It's actually working.",94,3524
"01","14","Marshall ","Yeah, smooth but slowly. God, close the deal, already. It's been, like, 45 minutes... we could have had s*x three times by now.",95,3525
"01","14","Lily ","Yeah, try five.",96,3526
"01","14","Marshall ","What up! Maybe we should just go out there.",97,3527
"01","14","Lily ","No way! We can't go out there now. They'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time. It'll be too weird.",98,3528
"01","14","Marshall ","Fine. But if we're stuck in here... I'm turning up the volume. Shh. Shh.",99,3529
"01","14","Victoria ","I want to know you. Like, know your soul. Ted, what makes you cry?",100,3530
"01","14","Lily ","Honey, could you hold my hair back, I think I'm going to hurl.",101,3531
"01","14","Robin ","So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?",102,3532
"01","14","Barney ","Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still...",103,3533
"01","14","Robin ","What?",104,3534
"01","14","Barney ","There is one other thing we could do. If you're up for it.",105,3535
"01","14","Robin ","Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!",106,3536
"01","14","Barney ","Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months.",107,3537
"01","14","Robin ","Oh, I believe it... this is awesome!",108,3538
"01","14","Barney ","Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you?",109,3539
"01","14","Robin ","Thank me later. Let's keep moving. These little bastards are everywhere.",110,3540
"01","14","Marshall ","He's just staring into her eyes.",111,3541
"01","14","Lily ","I don't know, we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us.",112,3542
"01","14","Marshall ","Yeah... now we just make fun of people like that. It's the circle of life.",113,3543
"01","14","Lily ","No, I'm serious, Marshall. I mean, we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip. And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom.",114,3544
"01","14","Marshall ","Well, it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria. This is their first time.",115,3545
"01","14","Lily ","Yeah, but we could still have some more romance. Now, you just say, ""Want to do it?"" And I say, ""Yeah.""",116,3546
"01","14","Marshall ","Want to...",117,3547
"01","14","Lily ","No! Maybe we're just out of firsts.",118,3548
"01","14","Marshall ","Looks like they're about to have theirs.",119,3549
"01","14","Ted ","Should we take this to the bedroom?",120,3550
"01","14","Marshall ","Yes!",121,3551
"01","14","Lily ","Yes!",122,3552
"01","14","Victoria ","Yes.",123,3553
"01","14","Marshall ","Yes!",124,3554
"01","14","Lily ","Yes!",125,3555
"01","14","Marshall ","No. No, don't answer it!",126,3556
"01","14","Victoria ","You can answer it. We have all night.",127,3557
"01","14","Marshall ","You're answering it? He's answering it!",128,3558
"01","14","Lily ","No! Do her! Do her now!",129,3559
"01","14","Ted ","Sure. Good luck with that. (He hangs up) Sorry about that.",130,3560
"01","14","Victoria ","How about a little more wine?",131,3561
"01","14","Ted ","I'll get another bottle.",132,3562
"01","14","Lily ","I need a drink. Do we have any cough syrup in here?",133,3563
"01","14","Marshall ","Shh...",134,3564
"01","14","Robin ","Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it.",135,3565
"01","14","Barney ","No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does.",136,3566
"01","14","Robin ","But I...",137,3567
"01","14","Barney ","Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky.",138,3568
"01","14","Robin ","See you on the other side.",139,3569
"01","14","Barney ","Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?",140,3570
"01","14","Robin ","Yeah.",141,3571
"01","14","Barney ","All right.",142,3572
"01","14","Lily ","Marshall, what happened to us? We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long. Have we lost that?",143,3573
"01","14","Marshall ","Maybe. But I think I just found it. Right here. Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering with just a hint of crazy eyes.",144,3574
"01","14","Lily ","Okay, well, get ready for my sex-ray vision. Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning? Oh, damn it.",145,3575
"01","14","Marshall ","It's all right. We can do this.",146,3576
"01","14","Lily ","Let's just hold hands. This is nice.",147,3577
"01","14","Marshall ","You love that move. It's a classic Marshall.",148,3578
"01","14","Lily ","All right, we totally suck at this. We really, really need to get out of here.",149,3579
"01","14","Marshall ","Well, we can't.",150,3580
"01","14","Lily ","Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you, it'll change the entire nature of our relationship.",151,3581
"01","14","Marshall ","What is it?",152,3582
"01","14","Lily ","I have to pee.",153,3583
"01","14","Marshall ","This is bad.",154,3584
"01","14","Lily ","Yeah.",155,3585
"01","14","Marshall ","We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other. You always think there'll be more time.",156,3586
"01","14","Lily ","Look at us. We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet. The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it, it might go out forever.",157,3587
"01","14","Marshall ","How much longer do you think you can hold it?",158,3588
"01","14","Lily ","I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon.",159,3589
"01","14","Marshall ","Oh, boy.",160,3590
"01","14","Robin ","Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game.",161,3591
"01","14","Barney ","Neither have I. Of course I cheat.",162,3592
"01","14","Robin ","Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L.",163,3593
"01","14","Barney ","Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.",164,3594
"01","14","Robin ","Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox.",165,3595
"01","14","Barney ","Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt.",166,3596
"01","14","Robin ","That's a woman.",167,3597
"01","14","Barney ","Oh, my mistake. Or is it?",168,3598
"01","14","Robin ","Let's just focus on your target.",169,3599
"01","14","Barney ","Right.",170,3600
"01","14","Robin ","Yeah, I got this one. Oh, my God. I love your jeans.",171,3601
"01","14","Woman ","Okay. Is this a lesbian bar? Because that girl with the blue shirt just...",172,3602
"01","14","Robin ","Oh, no. I am all about the dudes. Although pickings are pretty slim tonight. Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get.",173,3603
"01","14","Woman ","Really? 'Cause he's totally vibing me right now. Must be the jeans.",174,3604
"01","14","Robin ","Well, jeans will only get you so far. I'm going home with him.",175,3605
"01","14","Woman ","We'll see about that.",176,3606
"01","14","Lily ","Oh, my God, I hate Ted. I hate him so much.",177,3607
"01","14","Marshall ","Baby, why don't you just go? Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other.",178,3608
"01","14","Lily ","No, but we haven't, because I want to keep some of the mystery alive.",179,3609
"01","14","Marshall ","Well, you have farted in front of me.",180,3610
"01","14","Lily ","Yes, but I always cover it with a cough.",181,3611
"01","14","Marshall ","You always do.",182,3612
"01","14","Barney ","Hey.",183,3613
"01","14","Robin ","Hey.",184,3614
"01","14","Barney ","Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.",185,3615
"01","14","Robin ","What happened?",186,3616
"01","14","Barney ","Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release.",187,3617
"01","14","Robin ","But why?",188,3618
"01","14","Barney ","Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores.",189,3619
"01","14","Robin ","Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship?",190,3620
"01","14","Barney ","Hit!",191,3621
"01","14","Victoria ","Ted, I can't wait any longer.",192,3622
"01","14","Ted ","Should we move to the bedroom?",193,3623
"01","14","Victoria ","There's no time for that.",194,3624
"01","14","Marshall ","They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour, but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom?",195,3625
"01","14","Lily ","Baby, I can't hold it in any longer. It's time.",196,3626
"01","14","Marshall ","I know.",197,3627
"01","14","Lily ","I love you, Marshall.",198,3628
"01","14","Marshall ","I love you, Lily.",199,3629
"01","14","Barney ","Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake.",200,3630
"01","14","Robin ","Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys.",201,3631
"01","14","Barney ","Hard-core? That's the only way I play. (Barney strips down)",202,3632
"01","14","Robin ","I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing?",203,3633
"01","14","Barney ","I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me?",204,3634
"01","14","Robin ","No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends.",205,3635
"01","14","Barney ","Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night.",206,3636
"01","14","Robin ","What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.",207,3637
"01","14","Barney ","You invited me up to your apartment to ""play Battleship."" Is that not an internationally recognized term for s*x?",208,3638
"01","14","Robin ","No.",209,3639
"01","14","Barney ","Great. I hope you're happy. You sunk my battleship.",210,3640
"01","14","Lily ","I'm okay. You okay?",211,3641
"01","14","Marshall ","I feel the same. And yet, strangely different.",212,3642
"01","14","Lily ","I'm happy for my bladder, yet sad for us.",213,3643
"01","14","Marshall ","You had to do it, sweetie... for Ted. And, hey, look, at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes.",214,3644
"01","14","Lily ","Yeah. I guess our relationship had to take a hit so a new one out there could blossom. Oh, crap!",215,3645
"01","14","Marshall ","They must have heard that.",216,3646
"01","14","Lily ","Well, I guess we can come out now. I don't believe it. They're gone.",217,3647
"01","14","Marshall ","Good. 'Cause I got to take a whiz.",218,3648
"01","14","Robin ","Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second...",219,3649
"01","14","Barney ","But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well.",220,3650
"01","14","Robin ","Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted?",221,3651
"01","14","Barney ","I checked with Ted.",222,3652
"01","14","Barney ","Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well, I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right? I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin, you'd be cool with that, right?",223,3653
"01","14","Ted ","Sure. Good luck with that.",224,3654
"01","14","Barney ","Totally gave us his blessing.",225,3655
"01","14","Robin ","Really?",226,3656
"01","14","Barney ","Really.",227,3657
"01","14","Robin ","So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?",228,3658
"01","14","Barney ","Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh...",229,3659
"01","14","Robin ","What?",230,3660
"01","14","Barney ","You like Ted.",231,3661
"01","14","Robin ","I didn't say I liked Ted.",232,3662
"01","14","Barney ","You like Ted. Wow. This is huge.",233,3663
"01","14","Robin ","Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for...",234,3664
"01","14","Barney ","Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?",235,3665
"01","14","Robin ","You're not gonna tell him, are you?",236,3666
"01","14","Barney ","No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro.",237,3667
"01","14","Robin ","A-7.",238,3668
"01","14","Barney ","Miss.",239,3669
"01","14","Robin ","Of course.",240,3670
"01","14","Marshall ","Well, we still have one frontier left. Still got the deuce.",241,3671
"01","14","Lily ","Not making me feel better.",242,3672
"01","14","Marshall ","Well, it certainly was a first.",243,3673
"01","14","Lily ","It was, wasn't it? We still have firsts.",244,3674
"01","14","Marshall ","Of course we do. And you know what, I actually feel closer to you now. I want to know you. Like, know your soul.",245,3675
"01","14","Lily ","Marshall, what makes you cry?",246,3676
"01","14","Marshall ","This moment is fleeting because it's being chased by another moment.",247,3677
"01","14","Lily ","Oh, just grab my boob already.",248,3678
"01","14","Ted ","Come on, guys, get a room.",249,3679
"01","15",NA,"Ted from 2030: Kids, something you might not know about your Uncle Marshall is that he's always been good at games. I mean, unbeatable. Gin! Yahtzee! Poker!",1,3680
"01","15","Ted ","You don't have to shout out ""poker"" when you win.",2,3681
"01","15","Marshall ","I know. It's just fun to say.",3,3682
"01","15",NA,"Ted from 2030: We all finally agreed Marshall should be running our game nights instead of playing in them. Which he took to mean, ""invent your own game.""",4,3683
"01","15","Marshall ","It's called ""Marsh-gammon."" It combines all the best features of all the best games... Candy Land, I Never, Pictionary.",5,3684
"01","15","Robin ","Backgammon, obviously.",6,3685
"01","15","Marshall ","No. Backgammon sucks. I took the only good part of backgammon, the ""gammon,"" and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs.",7,3686
"01","15","Lily ","I'm so excited Victoria's coming.",8,3687
"01","15","Robin ","I'm going to go get another round.",9,3688
"01","15","Ted ","Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight. Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot, so don't say anything embarrass... Don't say anything. And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin, so we you could just avoid the...",10,3689
"01","15","Barney ","Well, well, well. How rich. You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend, yet, you have been lying to her since day one. Excuse me.Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on. So, nothing for him to stand on? Okay, and thanks so much. Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin? I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return.",11,3690
"01","15","Ted ","No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that.",12,3691
"01","15","Lily ","Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return?",13,3692
"01","15","Ted ","Nothing. It's nothing. And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria?",14,3693
"01","15","Lily ","Us? What would we do?",15,3694
"01","15","Ted ","Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have and, in fact, moved here to get away from. However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight?",16,3695
"01","15","Marshall ","Fine.",17,3696
"01","15","Lily ","Fine.",18,3697
"01","15","Ted ","Thank you.",19,3698
"01","15","Lily ","I should go help Robin.",20,3699
"01","15","Robin ","Hey.",21,3700
"01","15","Lily ","Hey. So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight?",22,3701
"01","15","Robin ","Oh, sure. She's great. Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted? No. Victoria's great. She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great. I said, ""She's great"" too many times, didn't I?",23,3702
"01","15","Lily ","You must really hate the bitch.",24,3703
"01","15","Marshall ","But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest, then you ""Marshall out,"" and all your chips go into the pot, and remember, if you ever ask the question ""What?"", then... you got to drink. Got it?",25,3704
"01","15","All ","No",26,3705
"01","15","Marshall ","Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just start, you guys'll pick it up. Newbie goes first. Roll.",27,3706
"01","15","Victoria ","Okay.",28,3707
"01","15","Marshall ","Three! You got Autobiography. Now, that's where you have to answer a personal question about your dating life truthfully in order to move on.",29,3708
"01","15","Ted ","Marshall, come on.",30,3709
"01","15","Marshall ","Hey, she's the one who rolled a three. Victoria, ""Have you ever cheated while in a relationship?"" Wow, good question.",31,3710
"01","15","Ted ","You don't have to answer that.",32,3711
"01","15","Victoria ","It's okay. Um, well, I was in a really crappy relationship in college, and I wound up kissing this guy at a party one night, and I felt terrible about it, so, I came clean, and we broke up.",33,3712
"01","15","Marshall ","Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer. You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains.",34,3713
"01","15","Barney ","So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?",35,3714
"01","15","Victoria ","What?",36,3715
"01","15","Marshall ","You said what, you got to drink!",37,3716
"01","15","Lily ","Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd, and the host said she knew you. What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?",38,3717
"01","15","Barney ","Shannon?! Shannon, Shannon... No, don't remember any Shannon.",39,3718
"01","15","Lily ","Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give...",40,3719
"01","15","Barney ","Where's the tape?",41,3720
"01","15","Lily ","Fine. I'll go get it.",42,3721
"01","15","Barney ","Cool, okay. You know, whenever.",43,3722
"01","15","Marshall ","Okay, Robin, your roll. Five! Another Autobiography... for the player to your left, which... Victoria!",44,3723
"01","15","Ted ","Of course.",45,3724
"01","15","Marshall ","Victoria, ""How many boyfriends did you have before you started dating Ted?""",46,3725
"01","15","Ted ","Wait, the card actually says ""Ted?""",47,3726
"01","15","Victoria ","Okay, uh, well, boyfriends--I guess I've only had... two.",48,3727
"01","15","Robin ","Prude alert.",49,3728
"01","15","Victoria ","Well... that's serious boyfriends. I've dated other guys in between.",50,3729
"01","15","Robin ","Oh, slut alert!",51,3730
"01","15","Barney ","Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach. Oh, wow, look at that. Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me.",52,3731
"01","15","Marshall ","Thank you! Finally somebody understands Marsh-gammon.",53,3732
"01","15","Lily ","Barney, what was on that tape?",54,3733
"01","15","Barney ","Too bad you'll never find out.",55,3734
"01","15","Lily ","Oh, damn it! If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse. Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did.",56,3735
"01","15","Barney ","What?!",57,3736

"01","15","Ted ","Play the tape, play it, play it!",61,3740
"01","15","Barney ","Ted! Fine, fine. You cannot play it. Shannon! I love you! I love you so much. What about us changing the world together? Don't tell me you've forgotten. I know I haven't. Will I ever see another rainbow? Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe? Baby, please Don't go There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love There's a thief in the palace and she's...",62,3741
"01","15","Marshall ","Did you try his cell phone?",63,3742

"01","15","Barney ","Oh, really? Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall? Show me how good it is.",72,3751
"01","15","Marshall ","All right.",73,3752
"01","15","Marshall ","I was stopping by Lily's kindergarten class to say hi, but they were all at recess. I really had to pee, so I went into the class's restroom. It was a-a smaller target than I'm used to, so I figured I should sit down. What I didn't realize was, it was a shared bathroom. I wish I'd pulled up my pants.",74,3753
"01","15","Lily ","The kids still call him Funny Butt.",75,3754
"01","15","Barney ","Okay. I'll tell you my story. Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today.",76,3755

"01","15","Victoria ","Okay, how about this? I will tell you my most humiliating story.",104,3783
"01","15","Marshall ","Yeah, Victoria, way to step up!",105,3784

"01","15","Shannon ","Barney, it's your dream. It's only two years. I know we can make it.",119,3798
"01","15","Barney ","As I walked away, I realized Shannon was an adult. Her father couldn't control her life. I had to go back and confront him. She was in the middle of a heated argument with her dad.",120,3799
"01","15","Marshall ","Now we all got to drink.",121,3800
"01","15","Ted ","Oh, my God. What happened next?",122,3801
"01","15","Barney ","I don't know, guys.",123,3802

"01","15","Barney ","How can... With your dad? I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!",138,3817
"01","15","Shannon ","Barney, that's not my dad. His name's Greg. I've been seeing him for a few weeks. I was hoping you'd just leave, and we could avoid all this.",139,3818
"01","15","Barney ","We're breaking up? But what about the Peace Corps?",140,3819
"01","15","Shannon ","Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase. Greg's older. He's successful. He buys me all this cool stuff.",141,3820
"01","15","Barney ","But I love you.",142,3821
"01","15","Shannon ","But he has a boat. You should go to the Peace Corps and forget about me.",143,3822
"01","15","Barney ","I didn't go. That night, I recorded my video and mailed it to Shannon. I didn't see her until a week later. There's sugar in the basket. Shannon! Shannon, you came back!",144,3823
"01","15","Shannon ","I'm just picking up my last paycheck.",145,3824

"01","15","Lily ","You've got to tell us.",154,3833
"01","15","Barney ","I don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it.",155,3834
"01","15","Ted ","Fine. Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...",156,3835
"01","15","Barney ","Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear. Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth. Why can't you?",157,3836
"01","15","Ted ","You're right. Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet, but a while back, I was kind of into Robin. In fact, on our first date, I might have said, ""I love you."" Understandably, she freaked out and I left. But unfortunately, the night did not end there.",158,3837
"01","15","Ted ","We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit.",159,3838
"01","15","Ranjit ","To one hell of a night!",160,3839
"01","15","Ted ","And I drank... a lot. So you guys think I should have kissed her? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now.",161,3840
"01","15","Barney ","Yes! Do it!",162,3841
"01","15","Ranjit ","To the cab.",163,3842
"01","15","Robin ","Hello? Is someone out there?",164,3843
"01","15","Lily ","You ralphed and ran?",165,3844
"01","15","Marshall ","I thought you were vomit-free since '93. So that was a lie?",166,3845
"01","15","Robin ","You re-returned for me. That's really sweet. Though you kind of ruined my customized Scherbotsky doormat.",167,3846
"01","15","Ted ","Sorry.",168,3847
"01","15","Robin ","It's okay.",169,3848
"01","15","Ted ","Victoria, I know this must be...",170,3849
"01","15","Victoria ","Yeah. It kind of is.",171,3850
"01","15","Barney ","Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story. But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine. We fast-forward eight years into the future.",172,3851
"01","15","Marshall ","Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year.",173,3852
"01","15","Barney ","Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight.",174,3853
"01","15","Barney ","Hi.",175,3854
"01","15","Shannon ","Barney?",176,3855
"01","15","Barney ","Hi, Shannon.",177,3856
"01","15","Shannon ","What are you doing here?",178,3857
"01","15","Barney ","Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life.",179,3858
"01","15","Barney ","She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker: Shannon's a mom. She has a little kid named Max. That's crazy. That could have been my kid. But instead, what do I have? My whole life's some money in the bank, some suits in my closet and a string of one-night stands.",180,3859
"01","15","Lily ","Hey. Come on. I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another, it doesn't make your life any worse.",181,3860
"01","15","Barney ","My life rocks! Money, suits and s*x. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.",182,3861
"01","15","Lily ","Nope.",183,3862
"01","15","Barney ","Yeah.",184,3863
"01","15","Lily ","Nope.",185,3864
"01","15","Barney ","Yeah.",186,3865
"01","15","Lily ","Sorry. Don't buy it. You're making it up. You're just trying to cover the fact that you actually had a profound moment of doubt about yourself and... Oh, my God.",187,3866
"01","15","Shannon ","Oh, Barney!",188,3867
"01","15","Barney ","Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?",189,3868
"01","15","Shannon ","Is your phone on?",190,3869
"01","15","Barney ","Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down.",191,3870
"01","15","Lily ","Ew, gross. Just stop it.",192,3871
"01","15","Barney ","Ladies, gentlemen... Ted. This has been a wonderful evening. I got great dirt on all you guys. I got Ted to tell the re-return. I finally nailed Shannon! Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right. And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is. Peace out, hombres!",193,3872
"01","15","Marshall ","I think Barney just won game night.",194,3873
"01","15",NA,"Ted from 2030: We spend so much effort trying to keep parts of our lives hidden even from our closest friends. But those rare times when we do open up, it's amazing how minor those secrets all end up seeming. Of course, not every secret was told that night. But that's getting ahead of the story.",195,3874
"01","16",NA,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when it comes to love, the best relationships are the ones that just come naturally.",1,3875
"01","16","Ted ","My first solo batch.",2,3876
"01","16","Victoria ","Um, I think those need to stay in the oven a while longer. Here's a professional tip. If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake. It's a beverage.",3,3877
"01","16",NA,"Ted from 2030: Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun, and easy, and uncomplicated. It was pretty great.",4,3878
"01","16","Barney ","Um, are you coloring in your butt?",5,3879
"01","16","Marshall ","I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.",6,3880
"01","16","Barney ","So wear another one.",7,3881
"01","16","Marshall ","I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.",8,3882
"01","16","Barney ","Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door.",9,3883
"01","16","Marshall ","Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world.",10,3884
"01","16","Barney ","Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.",11,3885
"01","16","Marshall ","A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding.",12,3886
"01","16","Barney ","Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks ""suit."" Tomorrow, noon, my tailor.",13,3887
"01","16","Marshall ","No thanks, dude. (Barney grabs Marshall's pants and tears them apart) Noon?",14,3888
"01","16","Barney ","Noon. See you then.",15,3889
"01","16","Victoria ","Hey, girls.",16,3890
"01","16","Robin and Lily"," Hey.",17,3891
"01","16","Victoria ","Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted. It's our two monthiversary, so we're going out to dinner.",18,3892
"01","16","Robin ","Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask.",19,3893
"01","16","Lily ","Robin!",20,3894
"01","16","Robin ","Oh, come on. We bust on each other. We're just at that place in our strong friendship.",21,3895
"01","16","Victoria ","Really? Oh.",22,3896
"01","16","Robin ","Get off me. Oh, see? I did it again.",23,3897
"01","16","Victoria ","What are you guys up to? Oh, dress shopping. You know, I make wedding cakes for a lot of fancy bridal shops. If you want, I could take you shopping, maybe get you a discount.",24,3898
"01","16","Lily ","Really? That'd be great.",25,3899
"01","16","Victoria ","Yeah. Huh. I should take this. Hello.",26,3900
"01","16","Robin ","Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster?",27,3901
"01","16","Lily ","Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them?",28,3902
"01","16","Robin ","The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.",29,3903
"01","16","Lily ","Sold. Victoria, what's wrong?",30,3904
"01","16","Victoria ","I've just been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany.",31,3905
"01","16","Ted ","Wait. Germany, Europe?",32,3906
"01","16","Victoria ","It's for two years. I figured I didn't have much of a chance, 'cause they don't let many Americans in, but... I'm in.",33,3907
"01","16","Ted ","So, this is the Europe Germany?",34,3908
"01","16","Victoria ","What other Germany would it be?",35,3909
"01","16","Ted ","The one in Epcot?",36,3910
"01","16","Victoria ","Ted.",37,3911
"01","16","Ted ","Sorry. Congratulations.",38,3912
"01","16","Victoria ","Thank you. I don't know if I'm going to go.",39,3913
"01","16","Ted ","Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?",40,3914
"01","16","Victoria ","I don't know. I just... I don't think that long distance really works for anyone.",41,3915
"01","16","Ted ","Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.",42,3916
"01","16","Victoria ","So, that leaves us with...",43,3917
"01","16","Ted ","Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel...",44,3918
"01","16","Victoria ","I have to leave on Monday.",45,3919
"01","16","Ted ","Monday, September the...?",46,3920
"01","16","Victoria ","Ted. Do you have any thoughts?",47,3921
"01","16","Ted ","Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want. We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.",48,3922
"01","16","Victoria ","It's a date.",49,3923
"01","16",NA,"Ted from 2030: And that's when things got complicated.",50,3924
"01","16","Marshall ","Hey, baby, how's the dress place?",51,3925
"01","16","Lily ","Everything's so fluffy and white. It's like shopping in a marshmallow. How's Barney's tailor?",52,3926
"01","16","Marshall ","Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.",53,3927
"01","16","Lily ","Well, good luck, baby.",54,3928
"01","16","Marshall ","Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?",55,3929
"01","16","Barney ","Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process.",56,3930
"01","16","Marshall ","You speak Ukrainian?",57,3931
"01","16","Ted ","Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option.",58,3932
"01","16","Marshall ","No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no s*x. k*ll me now.",59,3933
"01","16","Barney ","Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.",60,3934
"01","16","Ted ","Really? You?",61,3935
"01","16","Barney ","Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.",62,3936
"01","16","Marshall ","Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?",63,3937
"01","16","Ted ","Yeah.",64,3938
"01","16","Marshall ","Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, ""You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face."" Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am.",65,3939
"01","16","Ted ","Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point?",66,3940
"01","16","Marshall ","Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost k*lled us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay.",67,3941
"01","16","Ted ","Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.",68,3942
"01","16","Marshall ","Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.",69,3943
"01","16","Ted ","Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.",70,3944
"01","16","Barney ","Are you sure?",71,3945
"01","16","Ted ","All right. (He calls Victoria)",72,3946
"01","16","Victoria ","Hello.",73,3947
"01","16","Ted ","Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?",74,3948
"01","16","Victoria ","Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.",75,3949
"01","16","Ted ","Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye. (He hungs up) She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all.",76,3950
"01","16","Barney ","Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.",77,3951

"01","16","Barney ","Here. Play with this pin cushion.",79,3953
"01","16","Marshall ","God. I'm going to look hot.",80,3954
"01","16","Barney ","Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.",81,3955
"01","16","Marshall ","No way. The Kid does not sell out.",82,3956
"01","16","Barney ","Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.",83,3957
"01","16","Marshall ","No. I've made my decision.",84,3958
"01","16","Ted ","So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go.",85,3959
"01","16",NA,"Ted from 2030: And so I met her that night to tell her my decision.",86,3960
"01","16","Victoria ","All right, I've been thinking a lot about this... Okay, wait, before you say anything, I wanted to give you this. This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking.",87,3961
"01","16","Ted ","I want you to stay.",88,3962
"01","16","Marshall ","Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.",89,3963
"01","16","Lily ","Oh, good luck, baby.",90,3964
"01","16","Marshall ","Bye.",91,3965
"01","16","Woman ","Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear?",92,3966
"01","16","Lily ","Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.",93,3967
"01","16","Robin ","I saw a couple up front that were nice.",94,3968
"01","16","Lily ","Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.",95,3969
"01","16","Victoria ","Oh, these women are experts. They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear.",96,3970
"01","16","Lily ","Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!",97,3971
"01","16","Victoria ","At least we get free champagne!",98,3972
"01","16","Robin ","And cake.",99,3973
"01","16","Victoria ","Mm-hmm.",100,3974
"01","16","Robin ","Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?",101,3975
"01","16","Victoria ","You know, I don't know. I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted. I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works.",102,3976
"01","16","Lily ","Ugh. All talking and no s*x. k*ll me now.",103,3977
"01","16","Victoria ","I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One. That's pretty hard to walk away from.",104,3978
"01","16","Robin ","Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months.",105,3979
"01","16","Victoria ","But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted. He's amazing. He's the best guy I know.",106,3980
"01","16","Robin ","Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.",107,3981
"01","16","Victoria ","I really don't...",108,3982
"01","16","Robin ","s*x. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This b*st*rd's kicked.",109,3983
"01","16","Woman ","Thanks.",110,3984
"01","16","Victoria and Robin"," Oh!",111,3985
"01","16","Lily ","It's okay, guys, I hate it.",112,3986
"01","16","Victoria ","Just horrible.",113,3987
"01","16","Robin ","It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses.",114,3988
"01","16","Lily ","You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.",115,3989
"01","16","Victoria ","But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates? It's too soon. Ooh. Speak of the devil. Hello.",116,3990
"01","16","Ted ","Hey, random question: how do you feel cats?",117,3991
"01","16","Victoria ","Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.",118,3992
"01","16","Robin ","A cat person. Why am I not surprised?",119,3993
"01","16","Victoria ","Bye. Why does Ted want to know if I like cats?",120,3994
"01","16","Lily ","Maybe he's going to buy you one.",121,3995
"01","16","Victoria ","I did hear barking in the background. Maybe he was in a pet store. Does he want us to get a cat together?",122,3996
"01","16","Robin ","Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.",123,3997
"01","16","Victoria ","That is low. Do you really think that's what he's doing?",124,3998
"01","16","Robin ","Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany.",125,3999
"01","16","Victoria and Robin"," Aw.",126,4000
"01","16","Lily ","Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.",127,4001
"01","16","Robin ","Ugly, ugly, ugly.",128,4002
"01","16","Victoria ","I don't know what to say. You know what? We're doing this all wrong. I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun.",129,4003
"01","16","Lily ","Are you okay?",130,4004
"01","16","Robin ","I'm fine.",131,4005
"01","16","Lily ","Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.",132,4006
"01","16","Robin ","I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship.",133,4007
"01","16","Lily ","Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.",134,4008
"01","16","Victoria ","Somebody say ""beautiful princess.""",135,4009
"01","16","Lily ","Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.",136,4010
"01","16","Victoria ","Oh, look how happy she is. You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women who would never let any guy mess with my career. And now I'm actually thinking about it. I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something.",137,4011
"01","16","Robin ","I know what you mean.",138,4012
"01","16","Victoria ","You do?",139,4013
"01","16","Lily ","Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.",140,4014
"01","16","Victoria ","See, that's what I'm afraid of.",141,4015
"01","16","Robin ","Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.",142,4016
"01","16","Victoria ","Robin... I think that you are the coolest. I'm so glad that we're friends.",143,4017
"01","16","Robin ","Oh, no way... you're the coolest.",144,4018
"01","16","Victoria ","No, you are.",145,4019
"01","16","Robin ","Okay, I am.",146,4020
"01","16","Victoria ","I'm going to stay.",147,4021
"01","16","Victoria and Robin"," Aw.",148,4022
"01","16","Lily ","Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.",149,4023
"01","16","Robin ","Wow, you look incredible.",150,4024
"01","16","Lily ","Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?",151,4025
"01","16","Robin ","Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.",152,4026
"01","16","Lily ","Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married. (She sits on the cake, without noticing it) Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?",153,4027
"01","16","Robin ","Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake.",154,4028
"01","16","Victoria ","But, you know what? It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry.",155,4029
"01","16","Robin ","Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.",156,4030
"01","16","Lily ","It was like this when I found it?",157,4031
"01","16","Woman ","And how will you be paying for this?",158,4032
"01","16","Lily ","Credit card... s.",159,4033
"01","16","Victoria ","I wanted to give you... this. This is what happens when you... you know, let them finish baking.",160,4034
"01","16","Ted ","I want you to stay.",161,4035
"01","16","Victoria ","I have to go to Germany.",162,4036
"01","16","Ted ","You're going?",163,4037
"01","16","Victoria ","Yes. I have to.",164,4038
"01","16","Ted ","So that's what you decided?",165,4039
"01","16","Victoria ","Well, no... I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying, but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go.",166,4040
"01","16","Ted ","What is this, opposite day or something?",167,4041
"01","16","Victoria ","No.",168,4042
"01","16","Ted ","So it is?",169,4043
"01","16","Victoria ","Ted, we've only been dating for two months. I can't let you make this decision for me.",170,4044
"01","16","Ted ","I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are.",171,4045
"01","16","Victoria ","Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me?",172,4046
"01","16","Ted ","Well, that's just crazy.",173,4047
"01","16","Victoria ","Oh, okay. So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy.",174,4048
"01","16","Ted ","But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.",175,4049
"01","16","Victoria ","You'd have me.",176,4050
"01","16","Ted ","We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this.",177,4051
"01","16","Victoria ","So... we're breaking up?",178,4052
"01","16","Ted ","I guess so. I guess so.",179,4053
"01","16","Marshall ","God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.",180,4054
"01","16","Ted ","It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.",181,4055
"01","16","Marshall ","Well, thank you for acknowledging it. It was weird that you hadn't. Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?",182,4056
"01","16","Ted ","She's leaving tomorrow.",183,4057
"01","16","Marshall ","Yeah, but she's still in town.",184,4058
"01","16","Ted ","Yeah, she... she's still in town.",185,4059
"01","16","Marshall ","Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together. Ted, think about it this way: if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow, would you sit on the couch and cry about it, or would you run, and jump, and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?",186,4060
"01","16","Ted ","Awesome air kicks, huh?",187,4061
"01","16","Marshall ","New pajama bottoms?",188,4062
"01","16","Ted ","You know it.",189,4063
"01","16","Ted ","So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.",190,4064
"01","16","Victoria ","Wait, so we're sharing the leg?",191,4065
"01","16","Ted ","No, the leg is a metaphor.",192,4066
"01","16","Victoria ","How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day, and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next? I don't know, Ted.",193,4067
"01","16","Ted ","Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?",194,4068
"01","16","Victoria ","Well, what would you want to do?",195,4069
"01","16","Ted ","Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.",196,4070
"01","16","Victoria ","Like go to the Mets.",197,4071
"01","16","Ted ","Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.",198,4072
"01","16","Victoria ","See some monkeys at the zoo?",199,4073

"01","16","Robin ","Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune.",205,4079
"01","16","Lily ","No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.",206,4080
"01","16","Robin ","Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.",207,4081
"01","16","Lily ","Yeah, but only, like, second base.",208,4082
"01","16","Barney ","Look at us: two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash.",209,4083
"01","16","Marshall ","Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.",210,4084
"01","16","Barney ","So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?",211,4085
"01","16","Marshall ","Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp.",212,4086
"01","16","Barney ","Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.",213,4087
"01","16","Marshall ","B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price.",214,4088
"01","16","Barney ","Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.",215,4089
"01","16","Marshall ","You set this up! You set this whole thing up!",216,4090
"01","16","Barney ","I most certainly did...",217,4091
"01","16","Marshall ","Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise.",218,4092
"01","16","Lily ","I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.",219,4093
"01","16","Marshall ","What time is the interview?",220,4094
"01","16","Barney ","9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes. Don't worry, I know a guy.",221,4095
"01","16","Victoria ","I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks.",222,4096
"01","16","Ted ","Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the s*x.",223,4097

"01","18","Robin ","I don't know, it was just a, a rough day and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you. So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?",142,4474

"01","18","Ted ","You're smiling.",148,4480

"01","18","Marshall ","You never had a four-way.",156,4488

"01","18","Robin ","Oh, yeah. Do you like it?",163,4495
"01","18","Ted ","Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right.",164,4496
"01","18","Robin ","Wow. Weird.",165,4497

"01","18","Ted ","Um... Actually... I'm at Robin's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.",173,4505
"01","18","Marshall ","Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis, but what the bleep are you doing, dude?",174,4506

"01","18","Ted ","I hate how you're always right.",179,4511
"01","18","Lily ","It's my best and most annoying trait.",180,4512

"01","18","Ted ","Right.",190,4522
"01","18","Robin ","This is crazy.",191,4523

"01","18","Ted ","I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.",200,4532
"01","18","Victoria ","Okay. Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be? Length of an average pee? No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes. Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive...",201,4533
"01","18","Ted ","What do you want from me? People break up. It happens.",202,4534

"01","18","Ted ","Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night.",225,4557

In one night, I managed to hurt two people I cared about. And none of it would've happened if I just listened to my mom. So I guess if there's a lesson to be learned here, it's this: when it's 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep.",231,4563

"01","19","Barney ","Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out.",26,4589

"01","19","Barney ","Yes.",30,4593
"01","19","Ted ","No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?",31,4594
"01","19","Barney ","That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.",32,4595
"01","19","Marshall ","You just made that up.",33,4596
"01","19","Barney ","Withdrawn.",34,4597

"01","19","Barney ","Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump.",39,4602
"01","19","Ted ","No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.",40,4603

"01","20","Robin ","It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.",26,4848
"01","20","Lily ","Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist? And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations.",27,4849

"01","20","Barney ","Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?",29,4851

"01","20","Ted ","Hey, why don't we all go?",75,4897
"01","20","Robin ","I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in. We don't want to mess things up for Lily.",76,4898

"01","20","Marshall ","I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is.",117,4939
"01","20","Ted ","Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break. Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad, but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad.",118,4940
"01","20","Marshall ","Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it. First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize.",119,4941

"01","20","Robin ","Nerds who aren't good at math? Life's going to be rough, boys.",146,4968
"01","20","Lily ","Hi. Excuse me. I was wondering if you guys could play ""Good Feeling"" by the Violent Femmes. I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married and my fiancé wants to hire you guys as the band, but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play ""Good Feeling"" because that's our song, and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?",147,4969

"01","20","Ted ","What'd she say? What'd she say?",161,4983
"01","20","Robin ","He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me. I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive. Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's, it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes.",162,4984

"01","20","Scooter ","How is it moving too fast? We've been together for two years.",166,4988
"01","20","Lily ","I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already.",167,4989
"01","20","Scooter ","What's decided? I go to umpire school, you go to college. We move into my dad's house in Staten Island. We have kids, we grow old together. What's decided? It's wide open!",168,4990
"01","20","Lily ","Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us.",169,4991
"01","20","Scooter ","You're, you're breaking up with me?",170,4992

"01","20","Andrew ","I won't?",180,5002
"01","20","Lily ","No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to. You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old before your time wondering ""Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?""",181,5003

"01","20","Lily ","I don't want to be tied down. I want to live in France and Spain and Italy and just soak up life and put it on a canvas, even if it means being a waitress in crappy cafés for five years, I don't care. I'm going to be a painter. And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know? But anyway, I'm blabbering. Way to make new friends, Lily. I'm sorry. What was your name again?",207,5029

"01","21","Ted ","Did you talk to Marshall about it?",140,5204
"01","21","Lily ","He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...",141,5205

"01","21","Lily ","I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.",143,5207
"01","21","Ted ","Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.",144,5208
"01","21","Lily ","San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven.",145,5209
"01","21","Ted ","You don't want to get married.",146,5210

"01","21","Lily ","Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid.",149,5213

"01","21","Ted ","No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.",159,5223
"01","21","Lily ","Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, ""Yep. That was a mistake."" So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you?",160,5224
"01","21","Ted ","I don't know. You said ""mistake"" a lot. Lily, don't do this.",161,5225

"01","21","Ted ","You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.",214,5278
"01","21","Robin ","We're not indoors. We're in a van.",215,5279
"01","21","Ted ","Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.",216,5280
"01","21","Robin ","Never. What else?",217,5281
"01","21","Ted ","She loves lasagna.",218,5282
"01","21","Robin ","Barf.",219,5283
"01","21","Ted ","You know, I am sensing a pattern here.",220,5284
"01","21","Robin ","What else?",221,5285
"01","21","Ted ","Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.",222,5286
"01","21","Robin ","And she's looking to get married and have kids?",223,5287
"01","21","Ted ","Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl.",224,5288
"01","21","Robin ","Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids.",225,5289
"01","21","Ted ","Really? You don't want kids?",226,5290
"01","21","Robin ","You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8:56. You're early.",227,5291
"01","21","Ted ","Hey, thanks for picking me up.",228,5292
"01","21","Robin ","Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for.",229,5293
"01","21","Ted ","Thanks.",230,5294
"01","21","Robin ","All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.",231,5295
"01","21","Ted ","You're going to show me your hair?",232,5296
"01","21","Robin ","Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.",233,5297
"01","21","Ted ","You just made my night.",234,5298
"01","21","Robin ","Go.",235,5299
"01","21","Marshall ","Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice. Oh, hey, dude.",236,5300
"01","21","Ted ","Hey, guys.",237,5301
"01","21","Lily ","Hi.",238,5302
"01","21","Ted ","Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?",239,5303
"01","21","Lily ","Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.",240,5304
"01","21","Ted ","You think you might want to... drink the milk?",241,5305
"01","21","Lily ","No. Nope, I'm good. I don't need any milk.",242,5306
"01","21","Marshall ","Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date. How'd it go, dude?",243,5307
"01","21","Ted ","I didn't go.",244,5308
"01","21","Marshall ","What? Why?",245,5309
"01","21","Ted ","I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.",246,5310
"01","21","Marshall ","Why? She sounds perfect.",247,5311
"01","21","Ted ","I don't want perfect. I want Robin.",248,5312
"01","21","Marshall ","Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake.",249,5313
"01","21","Ted ","Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make.",250,5314
"01","21","Marshall ","Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence. You and Robin have tried this again and again...",251,5315
"01","21",NA,"Ted from 2030: Here's the thing about mistakes. Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake, you gotta make it anyway.",252,5316
"01","21","Lily ","Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.",253,5317
"01","21","Ted ","Hey, is this milk any good?",254,5318

"01","22","Ted ","So... what do you think?",2,5321
"01","22","Barney ","Robin again? Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together. Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.",3,5322
"01","22","Ted ","But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?",4,5323
"01","22","Marshall ","Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills. Anybody else get chills?",5,5324
"01","22","Ted ","Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Robin, so... I gotta do this. (Barney slaps him) Ow! What the hell?",6,5325
"01","22","Barney ","That wasn't me. That was the universe.",7,5326
"01","22",NA,"Ted from 2030: The funny thing was, at that very moment, the universe was working on something... a storm.",8,5327
"01","22","Weather man"," And so tropical storm Willy is going to be with us at least until Monday. It's gonna rain cats and dogs, folks. So don't step in a poodle. Sandy? Robin?",9,5328

"01","22","Sandy ","Yeah, but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck.",11,5330
"01","22","Robin ","Guess we'll have to take a rain check.",12,5331

"01","22","Sandy ","Shame, though. It was a pretty hot show tonight. The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end really got my freak juice flowing.",18,5337
"01","22","Marshall ","Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash and burn before you say, ""enough""?",19,5338
"01","22","Ted ","One more. One more time. One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture. And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it. If it's yes, great. If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever.",20,5339
"01","22","Lily ","So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?",21,5340
"01","22","Ted ","I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment.",22,5341
"01","22","Barney ","I see where this is going. Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work... usually. The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999. The characters: Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name...",23,5342
"01","22","Lily ","Universe. So, this plan you speak of?",24,5343
"01","22","Ted ","Remember the first night Robin and I went out? I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.",25,5344
"01","22","Marshall ","Yeah. Dude, that was awesome, but how are you ever going to top that?",26,5345
"01","22","Ted ","She should be here any second.",27,5346
"01","22","Musician ","Uh, we're pretty hungry. When do we get our pizza?",28,5347
"01","22","Ted ","Enough with the... we'll go get pizza later, all right? Just...",29,5348
"01","22","Robin ","Damn it.",30,5349
"01","22","Lily ","Hello.",31,5350
"01","22","Robin ","Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key.",32,5351
"01","22","Lily ","Extra key? Do I have an extra key to your apartment?",33,5352

"01","22","Robin ","Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith.",36,5355
"01","22","Lily ","No, wait, uh... Maybe you should just knock.",37,5356

"01","22","Robin ","Hi.",44,5363
"01","22","Ted ","Robin... I've sort of said this already. I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly. So this is me, just saying it. With strings. I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together. What do you say? What do you say?",45,5364
"01","22","Robin ","Yes. No. I don't know.",46,5365

"01","22","Musician ","Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier, you said there'd be pizza.",52,5371
"01","22","Ted ","No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards. Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here.",53,5372
"01","22","Musician ","Sure. We're not getting any pizza.",54,5373
"01","22","Robin ","Okay. Let's talk.",55,5374
"01","22","Ted ","Okay. Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?",56,5375
"01","22","Robin ","Thanks, guys. Just need a minute. Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though. Kind of an inside joke. Thanks. (The musicians leave) You're crazy.",57,5376
"01","22","Ted ","Right. Come on.",58,5377
"01","22","Robin ","It's not that I haven't thought about this. You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay? We only just started being friends again.",59,5378
"01","22","Ted ","I know. But... come on...",60,5379
"01","22","Robin ","And we want different things. That's still there. That's not going away. I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out and I'd lose you as a friend? I gotta think about this.",61,5380
"01","22","Ted ","Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane. Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious. I'm kidding. I'm serious.",62,5381
"01","22","Robin ","I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping.",63,5382

"01","22","Man ","And we're clear.",70,5389
"01","22","Robin ","You're leaving?",71,5390

"01","22","Robin ","Oh, congratulations.",73,5392
"01","22","Sandy ","Congratulations yourself.",74,5393
"01","22","Robin ","What do you mean?",75,5394

"01","22","Robin ","Wow. Thanks. And, yes.",77,5396
"01","22","Sandy ","Yes, what?",78,5397
"01","22","Robin ","Yes, let's go get dinner.",79,5398

"01","22","Robin ","Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip.",82,5401
"01","22","Ted ","Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date. With Sandy... and his weenie. I mean is this not a date?",83,5402
"01","22","Robin ","I don't-I don't know.",84,5403
"01","22","Ted ","So, what? You actually like this guy now?",85,5404

"01","22","Ted ","Yes, you do.",89,5408

"01","22","Ted ","I don't plan out every...",91,5410
"01","22","Robin ","Oh, really? What is all of this? I mean, why can't you just say, ""Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?"" No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates and let's spend the rest of our lives together.",92,5411
"01","22","Ted ","Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point? God, you are so terrified of anything real. It's like you're floating out in space. Touch the ground, Robin. Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake.",93,5412
"01","22","Robin ","I need to think about this.",94,5413
"01","22","Ted ","Fine.",95,5414

"01","22","Ted ","If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that.",97,5416
"01","22","Robin ","Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no.",98,5417
"01","22","Ted ","Then I guess it's not meant to be.",99,5418
"01","22","Barney ","Nice try, buddy.",100,5419
"01","22","Marshall ","Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure. She's made her choice and you can finally move on.",101,5420
"01","22","Ted ","Screw that. This ain't over.",102,5421
"01","22","Marshall ","Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said...",103,5422
"01","22","Ted ","I don't care what I said. This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be. It is meant to be, and you know why? 'Cause I mean it to be.",104,5423

"01","22","Barney ","What are you talking about?",114,5433
"01","22","Ted ","I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain!",115,5434

"01","22","Ted ","Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?",117,5436

"01","22","Ted ","Are you still in touch with her?",119,5438

"01","22","Lily ","Why not?",198,5517
"01","22","Marshall ","Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not. What if you decide to go be a painter and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore, and three months becomes forever? Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?",199,5518

"01","22","Ted ","Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work.

"01","22","Robin ","Why?",227,5546
"01","22","Ted ","Why? Because I made it rain, that's what I did today! And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!",228,5547

Barney seems to k*ll himself, miming a g*n in his mouth) Your friends can't stand to listen to you (DAY SIXTEEN, Barney is with Marshall who is crying and says ""It was a really beautiful song"". Barney mimes a rope around his neck). And you never seems to wear pants.

Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car?",136,5688

"02","03","Ted ","Doesn't matter. And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin Stacy: six kids in five years. The woman's basically a ride at a water park.",181,6153

"02","03","Ted's mother"," No, it wasn't a snap decision.",246,6218
"02","03","Ted's father"," We'd been separated almost two years.",247,6219
"02","03","Ted ","How could you not tell me this?!",248,6220
"02","03","Ted's mother"," We meant to, it just never seemed like the right time.",249,6221

"02","03","Ted ","Who the hell is Frank?!",254,6226
"02","03","Ted's father"," Oh, great guy. I actually set them up. You remember Dr. Muchnik. He did your braces.",255,6227
"02","03","Ted ","Okay, my head's about to explode, and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles, so I am leaving. (He leaves, following by his parents and Robin)",256,6228

"02","03","Marshall ","I just find it really confusing to be around you right now.",261,6233
"02","03","Lily ","It's the same for me. I think we're probably both better off trying to keep some distance for a while.",262,6234

"02","03","Ted's father"," Oh, great story. At a bar.",276,6248
"02","03","Ted ","That's it? That's what passes for communication in our family? Man, when I have kids, and I tell them how I met their mother, I'm gonna tell them everything, the whole damn story.",277,6249
"02","03","Ted's father"," I think it was an Irish bar.",278,6250
"02","03","Ted ","I just, I don't... I don't understand. You seemed so happy. When I was growing up, you seemed so... What happened?",279,6251
"02","03","Ted's father"," We just realized we're very different people.",280,6252
"02","03","Ted's mother"," Your father's kind of a head-in-the-clouds romantic, and I'm much more down to earth.",281,6253

"02","03","Ted's mother"," But we love Robin.",287,6259
"02","03","Ted's father"," Absolutely. Meeting you was the highlight of my trip. Well, second highlight.",288,6260

"02","03","Ted's mother"," I'm gonna get some juice.",297,6269
"02","03","Ted ","No. No.",298,6270

"02","04",NA,"Ted from 2030: Kids, sometimes your relationship goes so smoothly for so long that you think it will be that way forever. It never is.",1,6272
"02","04","Ted ","Well, we just had our first fight.",2,6273
"02","04","Robin ","We had our first fight.",3,6274
"02","04","Barney ","Oh, no, what'd you fight about? (He puts his headphones on).",4,6275
"02","04","Ted ","A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building...",5,6276

"02","04",NA,"Both Marshall and Barney: No.",9,6280
"02","04","Ted ","Yes.",10,6281

"02","04","Ted ","Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front.",12,6283
"02","04","Marshall ","Wow, so it's the whole package.",13,6284
"02","04","Barney ","Yeah, you did.",14,6285

"02","04","Barney ","Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft.",16,6287
"02","04","Marshall ","Yeah, you did.",17,6288
"02","04","Barney ","Had to.",18,6289
"02","04","Ted ","It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices.",19,6290
"02","04","Marshall ","Yeah, you did.",20,6291
"02","04","Ted ","That wasn't one.",21,6292
"02","04","Lily ","So you and Ted had your first fight. It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me.",22,6293
"02","04","Robin ","Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm.",23,6294
"02","04","Lily ","Ooh, two tragedies in one day.",24,6295
"02","04","Robin ","The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done.",25,6296
"02","04","Ted ","Hey.",26,6297
"02","04","Robin ","Hey.",27,6298
"02","04","Ted ","How was your day?",28,6299
"02","04","Robin ","Good.",29,6300
"02","04","Ted ","Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was?",30,6301
"02","04","Robin ","No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight?",31,6302
"02","04","Ted ","You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time.",32,6303
"02","04","Robin ","Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter.",33,6304
"02","04","Lily ","Robin!",34,6305
"02","04","Robin ","What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster.",35,6306
"02","04","Lily ","You should work at a su1c1de hotline.",36,6307
"02","04","Robin ","And then it got ugly.",37,6308
"02","04","Robin ","What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like Die Hard. But Field of Dreams? Once is more than enough.",38,6309
"02","04","Ted ","So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is Field of Dreams?",39,6310
"02","04","Robin ","It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid.",40,6311
"02","04","Robin ","So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie.",41,6312
"02","04","Lily ","Robin, he's upset because you wouldn't listen to him, not because you didn't like some movie.",42,6313
"02","04","Ted ","How do you not like Field of Dreams?!",43,6314
"02","04","Lily ","Listening is the foundation of a relationship. And if he's really droning on, you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards. You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI.",44,6315
"02","04","Robin ","I guess I don't know how to do that.",45,6316
"02","04","Lily ","Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober. That's what I tried to explain to the cop.",46,6317
"02","04","Robin ","No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?",47,6318
"02","04","Lily ","What the hell comes before ""Q""?",48,6319
"02","04","Ted ","Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.",49,6320
"02","04","Barney (brokenly) ","Can we talk about something else?",50,6321
"02","04","Marshall ","You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up.",51,6322
"02","04","Barney ","Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?",52,6323
"02","04","Marshall ","That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck.",53,6324
"02","04","Barney ","Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.",54,6325
"02","04","Ted ","I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job.",55,6326
"02","04","Marshall ","Your job's not boring.",56,6327
"02","04","Ted ","Robin thinks so.",57,6328
"02","04","Barney ","Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God.",58,6329
"02","04","Ted ","I love it when you quote Scripture.",59,6330
"02","04","Barney ","I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.",60,6331
"02","04","Ted ","Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.",61,6332
"02","04","Barney ","That's 'cause you're always like... (Dully) ""Ted Mosby, architect"". If it were me, I'd be like... (Confidently) ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude.",62,6333
"02","04","Marshall (suavely) ","Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off..",63,6334
"02","04","Barney ","Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Trust me.",64,6335
"02","04","Ted ","Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that?",65,6336
"02","04","Girl ","Are you kidding? Architects are hot. How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?",66,6337
"02","04","Ted ","Solid point. She did have hair of gold.",67,6338
"02","04","Girl ","Yes, she did.",68,6339
"02","04","Ted ","Mm-hmm.",69,6340
"02","04","Robin ","Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?",70,6341
"02","04","Carl ","No. Hey, Lily. You still single?",71,6342
"02","04","Lily ","Yes.",72,6343
"02","04","Carl ","You know... I've poured a lot of free drinks for you over the years. A lot.",73,6344
"02","04","Lily ","Carl, do you really want to be with a woman who would trade s*x for beer?",74,6345
"02","04","Carl ","Only if you're into it. It's on me.",75,6346
"02","04","Lily ","Thanks.",76,6347
"02","04","Robin ","I wonder where Ted went.",77,6348
"02","04","A girl"," Ted Mosby, the architect?",78,6349
"02","04","Robin ","Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier.",79,6350
"02","04","Girl 1"," And what made you decide you wanted to become an architect?",80,6351
"02","04","Ted ","Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess.",81,6352
"02","04","Girl 1"," I bet you can draw, can't you? You should draw me.",82,6353
"02","04","Ted ","Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to. Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right?",83,6354
"02","04","Girls ","Yeah.",84,6355
"02","04","Lily ","He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay?",85,6356
"02","04","Robin ","Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part.",86,6357
"02","04","Lily ","What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out.",87,6358
"02","04","Robin ","I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat.",88,6359
"02","04","Girl ","She's a kickboxing instructor. Her ass looks better than my face.",89,6360
"02","04","Robin ","All right, we'll swing by the party.",90,6361
"02","04",NA,"Ted from 2030: Now the party was for some of Marshall's classmates from Columbia Law School, who by day were some of the sharpest and most serious young legal minds in the country. By night, however...",91,6362
"02","04","Robin ","Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers.",92,6363
"02","04","Guy 1"," Okay! Seriously... Who wants to shave my ass?!",93,6364
"02","04",NA,"Ted from 2030: That guy went on to become a Supreme Court justice.",94,6365
"02","04","Lily ","Okay, where are the guys and the hooker?",95,6366
"02","04","Guy 2"," Yo, what's up, ladies? Welcome to the party. Yeah! Just need you to sign this release protecting the host from any and all responsibility should you harm yourself or a third party. Then freakin' rage! Yeah!",96,6367
"02","04","Robin ","Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted.",97,6368

"02","05","Marshall ","I don't care what either of you say, I am going to the Popover Pantry with Brad. We're here. We're hungry. Get used to it, brunch.",79,6591

"02","05","Barney ","Exactly! There was only one rule and you broke it.",86,6598
"02","05","Lily ","I bought groceries. That counts as changing something?",87,6599
"02","05","Barney ","Lily, if I wanted a fridge full of groceries or fresh coffee in the morning, I'd be in a relationship. But I don't want to be in a relationship. That's why I make it crystal-clear to every girl that walks through that door that this is not a place to leave a toothbrush. This is not a place to leave a contact lens case. This is a place to leave. Come on, 'll give you a tour. Uh, no flash photography please. Bienvenido to the bedroom. Dig this: King-sized bed, full-sized blanket, one pillow. Everything about this bed says ""our work here is done."" Next we say bienvenue to the bathroom. What, only one towel? What, no hairdryer? You know where I keep that stuff? Your place. Beat it. And the coup de gr&acirc;ce... Yeah, that's right. Patent-pending. And wilkommen to the hallway. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p*rn...",88,6600
"02","05","Lily ","Marshall doesn't have p*rn.",89,6601
"02","05","Barney ","Aww, that's sweet. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p*rn, I had mine professionally lit. Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough.",90,6602
"02","05","Lily ","And if that doesn't drive them away, there's always your life-sized storm-trooper.",91,6603
"02","05","Barney ","No,that's just awesome. So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here, I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else. My apartment does it for me.",92,6604

"02","05","Brad ","Oh, damn... The zucchini bread is ridonculous.",94,6606

"02","05","Marshall ","Yeah!",103,6615
"02","05","Barney ","Hey. Did the cold wake you?",104,6616

"02","05","Girl ","I don't buy into the myth that we need to shower every day.",107,6619
"02","05","Barney ","Okay. I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to...",108,6620
"02","05","Girl ","I'm boycotting coffee. You may as well drink the tears of a colombian peasant farmer. God, I love this place. Good thing I don't have a job because I could stay here all day.",109,6621

"02","05","Girl ","You son of a bitch! I can't believe I let you enter my sacred temple.",118,6630
"02","05","Barney ","Come on, baby. please, no. You don't understand. What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...? (The girl is gone. To Lily) You're not going anywhere. Live claritin clear. Wow, that was close. That hippie chick wouldn't leave. She was ready to squat here.",119,6631
"02","05","Lily ","Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?",120,6632
"02","05","Barney ","She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment... Except you. You're better than p*rn.",121,6633
"02","05","Lily ","Thank you.",122,6634
"02","05","Barney ","How would you like to extend your stay here? All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife, and scare off the occasional one-night stand. I know,I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles...",123,6635
"02","05","Lily ","I'll do it.",124,6636
"02","05","Barney ","Really?",125,6637
"02","05","Lily ","Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win.",126,6638

"02","05","Robin ","Ooh, third date. You know what that means.",132,6644
"02","05","Marshall ","It is not a date,okay. It's just two bros taking in a Broadway show.",133,6645

"02","05","Marshall ","We might grab a steak, yeah.",135,6647
"02","05","Ted ","Where at?",136,6648
"02","05","Marshall ","Café l'amour. (Ted and Robin laugh) Brad says the food is really good there, okay?",137,6649

"02","05","Marshall ","All right, you know what? You two are just threatened because I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' stuff. Well, guess what? It's my territory now. I'm peeing all over brunches, fancy dinners and musicals. That's right. Brad and I are taking back Broadway.",139,6651

"02","06","Mr Druthers"," Ah.",67,6813
"02","06","Lily ","Nice to meet you.",68,6814
"02","06","Mr Druthers"," Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?",69,6815
"02","06","Ted ","I, uh... I am an architect.",70,6816
"02","06","Mr Druthers"," Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?",71,6817
"02","06","Ted ","Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.",72,6818
"02","06","Mr Druthers"," Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?",73,6819
"02","06","Ted ","Absolutely.",74,6820
"02","06","Mr Druthers"," So you're going to design the...",75,6821
"02","06","Ted ","Styrofoam trees.",76,6822

"02","06","Mr Druthers"," That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? (He leaves)",81,6827
"02","06","Lily ","Man, that guy is a total, well... (gestures to the building model)",82,6828
"02","06","Marshall ","Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.",83,6829
"02","06","Barney ","Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",84,6830
"02","06","Marshall ","Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.",85,6831
"02","06","Barney ","Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?",86,6832
"02","06","Marshall ","Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.",87,6833

"02","06","Barney ","Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.",90,6836
"02","06","Pr Lewis"," Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.",91,6837
"02","06","Lily ","I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.",92,6838
"02","06","Ted ","He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop.",93,6839
"02","06","Robin ","Did you show lily your design?",94,6840
"02","06","Ted ","No.",95,6841
"02","06","Lily ","What design?",96,6842
"02","06","Ted ","It's nothing.",97,6843
"02","06","Robin ","It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.",98,6844
"02","06","Lily ","Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.",99,6845
"02","06","Ted ","Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough!",100,6846
"02","06","Barney ","Oh, my god. Incredible.",101,6847
"02","06","Pr Lewis"," Hmm... C minus.",102,6848
"02","06","Barney ","C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!",103,6849
"02","06","Pr Lewis"," You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.",104,6850
"02","06","Lily ","Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.",105,6851
"02","06","Ted ","Okay, I'm done.",106,6852
"02","06","Lily ","Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.",107,6853
"02","06","Ted ","Great. Thanks.",108,6854
"02","06","Mr Druthers"," Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.",109,6855
"02","06","Ted ","Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.",110,6856
"02","06","Mr Druthers"," Too green.",111,6857
"02","06","Ted ","Too green?",112,6858
"02","06","Mr Druthers"," Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?",113,6859
"02","06","Ted ","I can't un-picture it.",114,6860
"02","06","Mr Druthers"," Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!",115,6861

"02","06","Mr Druthers"," My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.",117,6863
"02","06","Ted ","Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.",118,6864
"02","06","Mr Druthers"," What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.",119,6865
"02","06","Ted ","Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.",120,6866
"02","06","Mr Druthers"," Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.",121,6867
"02","06","Ted ","Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)",122,6868

"02","06","Ted ","Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?",124,6870
"02","06","Lily ","That's easy. I took it.",125,6871
"02","06","Ted ","Why?",126,6872
"02","06","Lily ","It's simple.",127,6873
"02","06",NA,"[FLASHBACK]Mr Druthers: I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef. I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university",128,6874

"02","06",NA,"Mr Druthers (to a kid): What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!",130,6876
"02","06","Lily ","Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",131,6877
"02","06","Ted ","What does his ball have to do with anything?",132,6878
"02","06","Lily ","Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",133,6879
"02","06","Robin ","Hey, guys. What's going on?",134,6880
"02","06","Ted ","Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.",135,6881
"02","06","Robin ","Why? Was he being mean?",136,6882
"02","06","Ted ","You know about this?",137,6883
"02","06","Robin ","Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?",138,6884
"02","06","Lily ","Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.",139,6885
"02","06","Robin ","I gave them to you for your birthday.",140,6886
"02","06","Ted ","So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?",141,6887
"02","06","Lily ","I prefer to call them ""justice khakis.""",142,6888
"02","06","Ted ","That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.",143,6889
"02","06","Lily ","So is being mean.",144,6890
"02","06","Ted ","Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",145,6891
"02","06","Lily ","Well, that's why I left a note.",146,6892
"02","06","Ted ","A note?",147,6893
"02","06","Lily ","Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.",148,6894
"02","06","Ted ","Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.",149,6895
"02","06","Lily ","I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.",150,6896
"02","06","Marshall ","I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",151,6897
"02","06","Barney ","I know, I know.",152,6898
"02","06","Marshall ","You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.",153,6899
"02","06","Barney ","Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",154,6900
"02","06","Marshall ","Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.",155,6901
"02","06","Barney ","I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.",156,6902
"02","06","Barney ","I think I'm falling in love with you.",157,6903
"02","06","Pr Lewis"," Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.",158,6904
"02","06","Barney ","What? No.We had s*x yesterday.",159,6905
"02","06","Pr Lewis"," Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.",160,6906
"02","06","Ted ","When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",161,6907
"02","06","Lily ","No.",162,6908
"02","06","Ted ","What do you mean, no?",163,6909
"02","06","Lily ","I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.",164,6910

"02","06","Mr Druthers"," Everybody get in here now!",166,6912
"02","06","Lily ","""Who wants espresso?""",167,6913

"02","06","Lily ","Interesting.",169,6915
"02","06","Mr Druthers"," Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever ""allegedly"" did!",170,6916
"02","06","Lily ","Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.",171,6917
"02","06","Ted ","Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.",172,6918
"02","06","Lily ","No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",173,6919
"02","06","Ted ","This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",174,6920
"02","06","Lily ","All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",175,6921
"02","06","Ted ","No. You'll give it back or you're fired.",176,6922
"02","06","Lily ","I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",177,6923
"02","06","Ted ","Then you're fired.",178,6924
"02","06","Lily ","Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.",179,6925
"02","06","Marshall ","Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",180,6926
"02","06","Barney ","Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.",181,6927
"02","06","Marshall ","So you're going back over there?",182,6928
"02","06","Barney ","Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",183,6929
"02","06","Barney ","I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.",184,6930
"02","06","Pr Lewis"," Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.",185,6931
"02","06","Barney ","But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",186,6932
"02","06","Pr Lewis"," Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.",187,6933
"02","06","Mr Druthers"," Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.",188,6934
"02","06","Ted ","Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",189,6935
"02","06","Mr Druthers"," Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.",190,6936
"02","06","Ted ","Lily was mentally deranged.",191,6937

"02","06","Client ","That's a pen1s!",199,6945

"02","07","Barney ","Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",49,7024
"02","07","Ted ","So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?",50,7025
"02","07","Lily ","What would I be doing?",51,7026
"02","07","Ted ","Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.",52,7027
"02","07","Ted ","You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.",53,7028
"02","07","Lily ","Oh, right, is that the...?",54,7029
"02","07","Ted ","Yeah. Here's the model.",55,7030
"02","07","Lily ","You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.",56,7031
"02","07","Ted ","I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.",57,7032
"02","07","Lily ","How can he not see it? I mean there's the...",58,7033
"02","07","Ted ","I know.",59,7034
"02","07","Lily ","And the way it...",60,7035
"02","07","Ted ","I know.",61,7036
"02","07","Lily ","And the two little...",62,7037
"02","07","Ted ","I know.",63,7038
"02","07","Lily ","It is just...",64,7039
"02","07",NA,"Mr Druthers (arriving): Spectacular? Why, thank you.",65,7040
"02","07","Ted ","Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.",66,7041
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Ah.",67,7042
"02","07","Lily ","Nice to meet you.",68,7043
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?",69,7044
"02","07","Ted ","I, uh... I am an architect.",70,7045
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?",71,7046
"02","07","Ted ","Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.",72,7047
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?",73,7048
"02","07","Ted ","Absolutely.",74,7049
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," So you're going to design the...",75,7050
"02","07","Ted ","Styrofoam trees.",76,7051
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Once again, with feeling.",77,7052
"02","07","Ted ","Styrofoam trees.",78,7053
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Styrofoam trees!",79,7054
"02","07","Ted ","Styrofoam trees!",80,7055
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? (He leaves)",81,7056
"02","07","Lily ","Man, that guy is a total, well... (gestures to the building model)",82,7057
"02","07","Marshall ","Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.",83,7058
"02","07","Barney ","Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",84,7059
"02","07","Marshall ","Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.",85,7060
"02","07","Barney ","Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?",86,7061
"02","07","Marshall ","Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.",87,7062
"02","07",NA,"Barney (stepping into the office, speaking with an Italian accent): Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa...",88,7063
"02","07","Pr Lewis"," Tell me what you want or get out.",89,7064
"02","07","Barney ","Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.",90,7065
"02","07","Pr Lewis"," Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.",91,7066
"02","07","Lily ","I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.",92,7067
"02","07","Ted ","He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop.",93,7068
"02","07","Robin ","Did you show lily your design?",94,7069
"02","07","Ted ","No.",95,7070
"02","07","Lily ","What design?",96,7071
"02","07","Ted ","It's nothing.",97,7072
"02","07","Robin ","It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.",98,7073
"02","07","Lily ","Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.",99,7074
"02","07","Ted ","Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough!",100,7075
"02","07","Barney ","Oh, my god. Incredible.",101,7076
"02","07","Pr Lewis"," Hmm... C minus.",102,7077
"02","07","Barney ","C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!",103,7078
"02","07","Pr Lewis"," You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.",104,7079
"02","07","Lily ","Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.",105,7080
"02","07","Ted ","Okay, I'm done.",106,7081
"02","07","Lily ","Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.",107,7082
"02","07","Ted ","Great. Thanks.",108,7083
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.",109,7084
"02","07","Ted ","Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.",110,7085
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Too green.",111,7086
"02","07","Ted ","Too green?",112,7087
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?",113,7088
"02","07","Ted ","I can't un-picture it.",114,7089
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!",115,7090
"02","07","Ted ","What? What's gone?",116,7091
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.",117,7092
"02","07","Ted ","Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.",118,7093
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.",119,7094
"02","07","Ted ","Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.",120,7095
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.",121,7096
"02","07","Ted ","Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)",122,7097
"02","07","Lily ","Hey.",123,7098
"02","07","Ted ","Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?",124,7099
"02","07","Lily ","That's easy. I took it.",125,7100
"02","07","Ted ","Why?",126,7101
"02","07","Lily ","It's simple.",127,7102
"02","07",NA,"[FLASHBACK]Mr Druthers: I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef. I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university",128,7103
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.",129,7104
"02","07",NA,"Mr Druthers (to a kid): What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!",130,7105
"02","07","Lily ","Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",131,7106
"02","07","Ted ","What does his ball have to do with anything?",132,7107
"02","07","Lily ","Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",133,7108
"02","07","Robin ","Hey, guys. What's going on?",134,7109
"02","07","Ted ","Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.",135,7110
"02","07","Robin ","Why? Was he being mean?",136,7111
"02","07","Ted ","You know about this?",137,7112
"02","07","Robin ","Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?",138,7113
"02","07","Lily ","Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.",139,7114
"02","07","Robin ","I gave them to you for your birthday.",140,7115
"02","07","Ted ","So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?",141,7116
"02","07","Lily ","I prefer to call them ""justice khakis.""",142,7117
"02","07","Ted ","That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.",143,7118
"02","07","Lily ","So is being mean.",144,7119
"02","07","Ted ","Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",145,7120
"02","07","Lily ","Well, that's why I left a note.",146,7121
"02","07","Ted ","A note?",147,7122
"02","07","Lily ","Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.",148,7123
"02","07","Ted ","Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.",149,7124
"02","07","Lily ","I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.",150,7125
"02","07","Marshall ","I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",151,7126
"02","07","Barney ","I know, I know.",152,7127
"02","07","Marshall ","You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.",153,7128
"02","07","Barney ","Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",154,7129
"02","07","Marshall ","Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.",155,7130
"02","07","Barney ","I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.",156,7131
"02","07","Barney ","I think I'm falling in love with you.",157,7132
"02","07","Pr Lewis"," Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.",158,7133
"02","07","Barney ","What? No.We had s*x yesterday.",159,7134
"02","07","Pr Lewis"," Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.",160,7135
"02","07","Ted ","When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",161,7136
"02","07","Lily ","No.",162,7137
"02","07","Ted ","What do you mean, no?",163,7138
"02","07","Lily ","I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.",164,7139
"02","07","Ted ","Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.",165,7140
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Everybody get in here now!",166,7141
"02","07","Lily ","""Who wants espresso?""",167,7142
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note.",168,7143
"02","07","Lily ","Interesting.",169,7144
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever ""allegedly"" did!",170,7145
"02","07","Lily ","Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.",171,7146
"02","07","Ted ","Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.",172,7147
"02","07","Lily ","No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",173,7148
"02","07","Ted ","This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",174,7149
"02","07","Lily ","All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",175,7150
"02","07","Ted ","No. You'll give it back or you're fired.",176,7151
"02","07","Lily ","I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",177,7152
"02","07","Ted ","Then you're fired.",178,7153
"02","07","Lily ","Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.",179,7154
"02","07","Marshall ","Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",180,7155
"02","07","Barney ","Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.",181,7156
"02","07","Marshall ","So you're going back over there?",182,7157
"02","07","Barney ","Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",183,7158
"02","07","Barney ","I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.",184,7159
"02","07","Pr Lewis"," Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.",185,7160
"02","07","Barney ","But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",186,7161
"02","07","Pr Lewis"," Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.",187,7162
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.",188,7163
"02","07","Ted ","Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",189,7164
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.",190,7165
"02","07","Ted ","Lily was mentally deranged.",191,7166

"02","07","Ted ","Lily was mentally deranged!",193,7168
"02","07","Mr Druthers"," Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?",194,7169

"02","07","Client ","That's a pen1s!",199,7174

"02","08","Marshall ","Yeah...",38,7242
"02","08","Robin ","Coming up at 11:00: Are there piranhas in the East River? What you don't know... could eat you.",39,7243
"02","08","Marshall ","Robin! Stop the news!",40,7244
"02","08","Woman ","What the hell?",41,7245
"02","08","Robin ","It's okay. They're my friends.",42,7246

"02","08","Robin ","Oh, my God, that is so fantastic! I don't know if I can just leave work.",44,7248
"02","08","Woman ","It's okay, Mike can read the news tonight. (To the cameraman) Hey, Mike... You can read, right?",45,7249
"02","08","Mike ","Yeah, I'm the best at reading.",46,7250
"02","08","Robin ","Let's go to Atlantic City!",47,7251
"02","08","All ","Yeah!",48,7252
"02","08","Ted ","You guys are eloping! Oh, that's fantastic. Wait, is this because there's a time crunch Uncle Ted should know about?",49,7253
"02","08","Lily ","I hope not because I plan on getting hammered.",50,7254
"02","08","Ted ","Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work. I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager.",51,7255
"02","08","Lily ","Ted, for the rest of our lives, we are going to be telling the amazing story of how we went to Atlantic City and got married. Don't you want to be in that story?",52,7256
"02","08","Ted ","Of course I do. Let's go to Atlantic City!",53,7257
"02","08","Marshall ","Yeah!",54,7258
"02","08","Ted ","Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate?",55,7259
"02","08","Marshall ","You got it.",56,7260
"02","08","Barney ","Hey, guys.",57,7261
"02","08","Ted ","Wow. A pedicure.",58,7262
"02","08","Barney ","Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine.",59,7263
"02","08","Lily ","We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!",60,7264
"02","08","Barney ","Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?",61,7265
"02","08","Marshall ","So are you in or not?",62,7266
"02","08","Barney ","Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done.",63,7267
"02","08","Marshall ","No, we got to get going to the...",64,7268

"02","08","Marshall ","And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.",68,7272
"02","08","Barney ","Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend.",69,7273
"02","08","Ted ","You been here before?",70,7274
"02","08","Barney ","Oh, uh, once or twice.",71,7275
"02","08","Chinese 1"," Barney!",72,7276
"02","08","Barney ","Ah, good to see you, too. Three times, maybe.",73,7277

"02","08",NA,"Barney, Ted and Robin: Yeah.",76,7280
"02","08","Lily ","Oh, crap. I don't have a veil. I'm a bride, I can't get married without a veil. And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet. Oh, my God, we're getting married.",77,7281
"02","08","Robin ","Don't worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey.",78,7282
"02","08","Lily ","Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit.",79,7283

"02","08","Ted ","You guys want to go gamble?",84,7288
"02","08","Marshall ","No, we got to go get the veil.",85,7289
"02","08","Ted ","Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one.",86,7290
"02","08","Marshall ","Yeah, okay.",87,7291
"02","08","Barney ","No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil. (He leaves)",88,7292

"02","08","Marshall ","Great, a little nervous.",92,7296
"02","08","Ted ","Yeah? Craps?",93,7297
"02","08","Marshall ","Not that nervous.",94,7298
"02","08","Ted ","No, I mean do you want to play craps.",95,7299
"02","08","Marshall ","Oh, yeah, definitely.",96,7300
"02","08","Barney ","Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?",97,7301
"02","08","Ted ","What did you just say?",98,7302
"02","08","Marshall ","Barney, no.",99,7303
"02","08","Barney ","Marshall, I'm your best man.",100,7304
"02","08","Marshall ","You're not my best man.",101,7305

"02","08","Marshall ","You're not my best friend.",104,7308
"02","08","Ted ","Right here.",105,7309
"02","08","Marshall ","Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party. I've got, like, 18 minutes.",106,7310
"02","08","Ted ","18 minutes...",107,7311
"02","08","Lily ","Oh, good. Did you get the veil?",108,7312
"02","08","Barney ","Of course.",109,7313
"02","08","Marshall ","And it took us exactly 18 minutes. We went to a strip club.",110,7314
"02","08","Ted ","Dude!",111,7315
"02","08","Barney ","Unbelievable!",112,7316
"02","08","Marshall ","We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance.",113,7317
"02","08","Lily ","Your last lap dance ever.",114,7318
"02","08","Marshall ","Right. What?",115,7319
"02","08",NA,"Robin (arriving, wearing a ""shirt boobs""): Okay, I'm here. Right?",116,7320
"02","08","Ted ","Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City.",117,7321
"02","08","Robin ","Does it smell like strippers in here?",118,7322
"02","08","Ted ","That's weird, right? Marshall and Lily are getting married!",119,7323
"02","08","Lily ","Hell, yeah, look at this. (She turns on her musical bouquet, playing the Wedding March)",120,7324
"02","08","Marshall ","Oh, baby, this is it. Let's do this thing.",121,7325
"02","08","Lily ","Hi. We're here to get married.",122,7326
"02","08","Woman ","Congratulations. We offer a variety of packages to give you the special day you've always dreamed about.",123,7327
"02","08","Marshall ","We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine.",124,7328
"02","08","Woman ","Yeah. You know this isn't Vegas, right?",125,7329
"02","08","Robin ","Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen. Here, it looks like everyone brought their own.",126,7330
"02","08",NA,"Ted (looking at Robin's shirt): What?",127,7331
"02","08","Woman ","It also takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey. The earliest I could book you for is Monday.",128,7332
"02","08","Lily ","No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point.",129,7333
"02","08","Woman ","Look, I don't know what to say, but if you guys don't want to book a wedding for Monday or play a round of keno, I can't help you. Thirty-five.",130,7334
"02","08","Ted ","Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time.",131,7335
"02","08","Woman ","Yes, they do, but they don't elope. They choose Atlantic City for its white sand beaches, world-class amenities, and exotic Riviera feel.",132,7336
"02","08","Lily ","Have you been outside?",133,7337
"02","08","Ted ","There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana.",134,7338
"02","08","Marshall ","You guys, take it easy, guys. Are you sure about this?",135,7339
"02","08","Woman ","About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.",136,7340
"02","08","Barney ","Bright side: the bachelor party continues!",137,7341
"02","08","Ted ","Yes! Continues? You mean ""start."" He means ""start."" We went to a strip club.",138,7342
"02","08","Woman ","Twenty-seven.",139,7343
"02","08","Lily ","Is there any way that we could get a license today?",140,7344
"02","08","Woman ","You could go to the courthouse. In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be waived, but you have to have a good reason.",141,7345
"02","08","Lily ","Well, we're in love.",142,7346
"02","08","Marshall ","What better reason could there be?",143,7347
"02","08","Woman ","The last one I heard was, ""I'm going to Iraq tomorrow to defend my country,"" but, you know, give yours a whirl.",144,7348
"02","08",NA,"Ted from 2030: So we went to the courthouse.",145,7349
"02","08","Marshall ","God, this is taking forever.",146,7350
"02","08","Robin (to Ted) ","Can't believe they're getting married.",147,7351
"02","08","Ted ","I know. I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through. In fact, that crazy road has led them all the way here to Atlantic City...",148,7352
"02","08","Robin ","Ted, up here.",149,7353
"02","08","Ted ","Uhm?",150,7354
"02","08","Robin ","You were just staring at my shirt boobs.",151,7355
"02","08","Ted ","No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt.",152,7356
"02","08","Chinese 2"," Hey, it's Barney! Barney!",153,7357
"02","08","Barney ","Hi.",154,7358
"02","08","Chinese 2"," (speaks Chinese language)...suit up! (both speak Chinese language) Legen-...-dary!",155,7359

"02","08","Barney ","A... Chinese guy?",158,7362
"02","08","Marshall ","Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license, but we need to skip the waiting period because... We're in love.",159,7363
"02","08","Woman 2"," Aw. I'm gonna waive this waiting period right now.",160,7364
"02","08","Lily ","Oh, really?!",161,7365
"02","08","Woman 2"," Is what I would say if I could waive the waiting period, but unfortunately, only a judge can do that.",162,7366
"02","08","Lily ","Oh. Well, so can we see a judge?",163,7367
"02","08","Woman 2"," Absolutely.",164,7368
"02","08","Lily ","Really?!",165,7369
"02","08","Woman 2"," Is what I would say if there was any chance of you seeing a judge today, which there isn't.",166,7370
"02","08","Marshall ","Why are you doing this to us?!",167,7371
"02","08","Woman 2"," 'Cause you're on Candid Camera!",168,7372
"02","08","Robin ","Really?!",169,7373
"02","08","Woman 2"," Is what I would say...",170,7374
"02","08","Marshall ","You know what? We get it.",171,7375
"02","08","Lily ","Okay, this is a good plan B. Judges are people. People go to the bathroom. A judge is bound to come by eventually, and we'll get married. I'm sure we won't be waiting long.",172,7376
"02","08","Marshall ","Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds.",173,7377
"02","08","Barney ","Vultures.",174,7378
"02","08","Ted (to Robin) ","Psst. (They move away)",175,7379
"02","08","Robin ","What? Here?",176,7380
"02","08","Ted ","Yeah. Got a little time to k*ll.",177,7381
"02","08","Robin ","Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it?",178,7382
"02","08","Ted ","No. A little.",179,7383
"02","08","Robin ","Something is seriously wrong with you.",180,7384
"02","08","Ted ","So what, is that a no?",181,7385
"02","08","Robin ","All right, let's do it.",182,7386
"02","08","Ted ","All right. Um, also...?",183,7387
"02","08","Robin ","Yes, I'll leave it on.",184,7388
"02","08","Ted ","Sweet.",185,7389
"02","08","Barney ","Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen.",186,7390
"02","08","Lily ","Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative.",187,7391
"02","08","Barney ","You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that bullet.",188,7392
"02","08","Lily ","Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on!",189,7393
"02","08","Judge ","Turn it off.",190,7394
"02","08","Lily ","Okay. May we please get married today?",191,7395
"02","08","Judge ","Now, normally I would say no to a request like that, but you two impress me. Just the fact that you've been together for ten years, standing by each other's side through thick and thin, never wavering. What was that?",192,7396
"02","08","Lily ","What was what?",193,7397
"02","08","Judge ","That little look. What was that?",194,7398
"02","08","Marshall ","A look of love.",195,7399
"02","08","Judge ","You two have stood together through thick and thin, right?",196,7400
"02","08","Marshall ","You know, what's thick? what's thin?",197,7401
"02","08","Lily ","Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.",198,7402
"02","08","Marshall ","I have.",199,7403
"02","08","Judge ","All right, what was that look? What's going on?",200,7404
"02","08","Barney ","They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had s*x in the closet. What? We're under oath.",201,7405
"02","08","Ted ","No, we're not.",202,7406
"02","08","Barney ","Yeah, we are. He's a judge.",203,7407
"02","08","Ted ","Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?",204,7408
"02","08","Barney ","Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it.",205,7409
"02","08","Marshall ","Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen.",206,7410
"02","08","Lily ","No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today.",207,7411
"02","08","Marshall ","Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license.",208,7412
"02","08","Lily ","Except international waters. So let's find a ship captain. A ship captain can marry us. There's boats all over this place.",209,7413
"02","08","Ted ","Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage?",210,7414
"02","08","Lily ","This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go. (To a woman) Excuse me. Are you a ship captain?",211,7415
"02","08","Woman ","This is my machine.",212,7416
"02","08","Marshall ","I should go talk to her.",213,7417

"02","08","Ted ","Blackjack?",215,7419
"02","08","Marshall ","Yeah.",216,7420
"02","08","Lily ","Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip, so we're getting closer.",217,7421
"02","08","Robin ","Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today?",218,7422
"02","08","Lily ","Because... If we don't do it today, I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people looking all disapproving and judging me while sipping little cups of mayonnaise and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long.",219,7423
"02","08","Robin ","Nobody's gonna do that.",220,7424
"02","08","Lily ","No, they're not because I'm not gonna give them the chance. I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight.",221,7425
"02","08","Robin ","Sweetie, this is crazy. You're never gonna find a ship capt...",222,7426
"02","08","Marshall ","Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain.",223,7427

"02","08","Ted ","Yeah. First guy we talked to. Ship captain. How great is that?",225,7429
"02","08","Lily ","See? See, this is destiny. So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us?",226,7430
"02","08","Captain ","I sure can. If there's two things I love, it's bringing people together in marriage and making $5,000.",227,7431
"02","08","Marshall ","What?",228,7432
"02","08","Lily ","Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it.",229,7433
"02","08","Barney ","I can get us that money.",230,7434
"02","08","Ted ","How?",231,7435
"02","08","Barney ","Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?",232,7436
"02","08","Ted ","Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?",233,7437
"02","08","Barney ","Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called ""Shing Hasabu Shing"". Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money.",234,7438
"02","08","Robin ","No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away.",235,7439

"02","08","Ted ","Not a clue.",239,7443

"02","08","Captain ","Okay, uh... You guys want the serious one or the funny one?",252,7456
"02","08","Captain ","You sure? I got a lot of great nautical jokes in there. Like how you two float each other's boat, stuff like that.",253,7457

"02","08","Ted ","You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?",266,7470

"02","09","Marshall ","Um, if a problem arises and we need a ruling, that's your job. Barney: But you have to be unbiased and put the integrity of slap bet above all else. This is an honor you will take with you to your grave. On your tombstone, it will read ""Lily Aldrin, caring wife, loving friend, Slap Bet Commissioner.""",115,7602

"02","09","Ted ","I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that?",126,7613

"02","09","Robin ","He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough.",135,7622

"02","10","James ","Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys... you are young, attractive people here in the greatest city on earth. There are boys and girls in Nobody Cares, Wyoming, wishing they could be here. But instead, they are in someone's basement drinking bad malt liquor, debating whether or not they're going to spend their Saturday night in the parking lot of the feed store or in some other dude's basement. You owe it to them to rise up and shimmy your lazy asses into something hot, and you go out there and you live their dream!- Can I get a ""hell, yeah""?",65,7843

"02","10","Marshall ","Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change.",156,7934
"02","10","Barney ","Yeah. Like things haven't changed with you people.",157,7935
"02","10","Ted ","Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like. Sandals and socks--come on, buddy. But I took her out, we celebrated. It was the right thing to do. You got to support him.",158,7936
"02","10","Barney ","You're right, Ted. This is a cause for celebration. We need to take him out and celebrate the commitment he and Tom are about to make.",159,7937
"02","10","James ","Yeah. This is where we're celebrating the commitment that Tom and I are about to make?",160,7938
"02","10","Barney ","What? Yeah! See, that cage represents your commitment.",161,7939
"02","10","Marshall ","Oh, my God. Freedom has never tasted so delicious.",162,7940
"02","10","Man ","Hey. You work out?",163,7941
"02","10","Marshall ","I do. And thank you for noticing. You're obviously in very good shape yourself.",164,7942
"02","10","Man ","Well, I try. So you want to dance?",165,7943
"02","10","Marshall ","You know what? I'm very flattered, and, objectively, you're a very attractive man, but this is actually my fiancée.",166,7944
"02","10","Man ","I'm sorry. You know, I saw your drink and I...",167,7945
"02","10","Marshall ","No, no, this isn't my drink. This is hers.",168,7946
"02","10","Lily ","No, it isn't.",169,7947
"02","10","Man ","Whatever. How 'bout you?",170,7948
"02","10","Ted ","Oh, I'm straight, too. But I thank you for your time, and I appreciate your interest in my body.",171,7949
"02","10","Marshall ","You see that? Being hit on doesn't have to be terrible. I feel flattered, and everyone left with their dignity.",172,7950
"02","10","Man ","Hey, I really like your sweater.",173,7951
"02","10","Robin ","Wow. You actually do, don't you? You're not checking out my boobs or anything.",174,7952
"02","10","Man ","My name's Gay Ken, what do you think?",175,7953
"02","10","Robin ","I love this place! Let's dance!",176,7954
"02","10","Lily "," - And not be groped!",177,7955
"02","10","Robin ","- Whoo! Thank you.",178,7956
"02","10","Ted ","- Thank you!",179,7957
"02","10","Marshall ","- We're hot.",180,7958
"02","10","Ted ","- Totally.",181,7959
"02","10","James "," And then Tom says to the dealer that the handmade Georgian clock has a chip on the corner. Blam, we get that puppy half price. What up?! Bam!",182,7960
"02","10","Barney ","Sounds like you really rocked that arts and crafts fair.",183,7961
"02","10","James ","Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Hey, oh, my God. This is so liberating, being able to talk about this to you. I cannot wait for you to meet Tom.",184,7962
"02","10","Barney ","And I cannot wait for you to meet my good friend... this guy. Excuse me, do you know anyone who would like to buy my incredibly muscular, fun, large-handed brother a drink?",185,7963
"02","10","James ","Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you, Barnaby. Okay. All right. I spy a group of women who have let their defenses down because they are in a gay club. You see that chick right there? She looks like she'd fall for sports agent and football player.",186,7964
"02","10","Barney ","Okay, I'm in. Which one am I?",187,7965
"02","10","James ","Please.",188,7966
"02","10","Barney ","He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil, and drops his pants after three dirty martinis. Now go, man, go!",189,7967
"02","10","Marshall ","I just never thought I'd see Barney so vulnerable.",190,7968
"02","10","Ted ","Well, I guess no one wants to feel like they're going through the world alone.",191,7969
"02","10","Man ","Look at me, in a yummy sandwich!",192,7970
"02","10","Marshall ","Okay, we're actually right in the middle of something right now, so...",193,7971
"02","10","Man ","Ooh, I know what I want to be in the middle of. Thoughts?",194,7972
"02","10","Ted ","God, can't two straight guys come to a gay dance club, enjoy some techno and good conversation without being bothered?",195,7973
"02","10","Robin ","How's it going, guys? Still enjoying the attentions of men?",196,7974
"02","10","Marshall ","That's like the eighth guy who's hit on us in ten minutes. It's like, hello,",197,7975
"02","10","Ted ","And it's never the hot ones. It's always the losers. Bums me out!",198,7976
"02","10","Lily ","Looks like the boys learned their lesson. Do you totally miss being hit on?",199,7977
"02","10","Robin ","Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar.",200,7978
"02","10","Barney ","James, James, since you like arts and crafts, look at what Charles here made with cherry stems. He did it with his tongue. Yeah.",201,7979
"02","10","James ","Barney.",202,7980
"02","10","Barney ","So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone, and once he's in a funner mood...",203,7981
"02","10","James ","Barney, Barney, I don't want his number. I don't want anyone's number, okay? I'm getting married.",204,7982
"02","10","Charles ","Wow.- Best of luck to you both.",205,7983
"02","10","James ","- Thank you.",206,7984
"02","10","Charles ","My number's in here. I'm very discreet.",207,7985
"02","10","James ","Okay, okay, excuse me. Barney, family talk. Okay, dude, you have got to stop this, okay? I know that my getting married is threatening to your way of life...",208,7986
"02","10","Barney ","Oh, so now it's my way of life? I thought it was our way of life. You've completely turned your back on it. Look at you, not even suited up. Do you remember why we suit up, James?",209,7987
"02","10","James ","To get laid.",210,7988
"02","10","Barney ","To show people that we are different from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there. The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with, a two-person army that plays by its own rules. But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines, and you've abandoned me. Well, I'm not gonna let you do that. It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing! You don't have to do this, bro!",211,7989
"02","10","James ","- Yes, I do.",212,7990
"02","10","Barney ","- Why?!",213,7991
"02","10","James ","Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby.",214,7992
"02","10","Barney ","What? There's gonna be a baby?",215,7993
"02","10","James ","Yes. We're adopting.",216,7994
"02","10","Barney ","Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?",217,7995
"02","10","James ","For the rest of your life.",218,7996
"02","10","Barney ","To James and Tom. May you have a long and happy life together. And may I always have the skin and libido of a much younger man.- Cheers.",219,7997
"02","10","Tous ","- Cheers.",220,7998
"02","10","Barney ","Thanks. I decided to leave out the hetero college phase. No one wants to",221,7999
"02","10","Lily ","It was perfect. You even made Tom's dad cry. Might have been doing that because he's a Republican.",222,8000
"02","10","Marshall ","Whoa. It's 9:00. We should be getting back. You guys want to split a cab?",223,8001
"02","10","Ted ","Uh, no, I think I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.",224,8002
"02","10","Robin ","Yeah, me, too. I'm not tired at all.",225,8003
"02","10","Marshall ","All right, well, it's getting late. Got to get the wife home.",226,8004
"02","10","Lily ","Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat.",227,8005
"02","10","Barney ","Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.",228,8006
"02","10","Barney ","- May I?",229,8007
"02","10","James ","- Yeah.",230,8008
"02","10","Barney ","Hey, buddy. Your parents are married. Now, listen, you. Just because you're being raised by married people doesn't mean you have to choose that lifestyle. High-five. Luckily, you got me. In 20 and a half years, you'll be 21, and I will be... Well, I haven't decided how old I'll be yet. But we are gonna bro out, uncle and nephew style. Stick with me, kid. I am gonna teach you how to live. Great suit, by the way. Who is the cutest?",231,8009
"02","10","Rosa ","I don't get it. Tom liked my breasts in tenth grade. Why doesn't he like them now? Why?",232,8010
"02","10","Barney ","Rosa, why always be attracted to the unavailable ones? Why not accept the fact that you're a beautiful woman who is worthy of love? Are you brave enough to hear that? You...",233,8011
"02","11",NA,"Ted (V.O.): Kids, as you know, Christmas is a time you spend with your family. So in December of 2006, I had three options. Spend it with my mom and her new boyfriend Clint, spend it with my dad and his new girlfriend micro-brewing, or head down to Staten Island to spend it with my super religious cousin Stacy and her family. So I opted for none of the above and decided to spend Christmas 2006 in Manhattan... celebrating with my other family.",1,8012
"02","11","Marshall ","Okay, I have one last paper due at 5:00 p.m. today, so until then, I will be at the law library at school, but I'm not to be disturbed for any reason.",2,8013
"02","11","Ted ","Dude, open your eyes. You're going to hurt yourself.",3,8014
"02","11","Marshall ","No, no. Christmas Eve winter wonderland is my reward for finishing my paper. Baby, do I smell your Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies?",4,8015
"02","11","Lily ","Yes.",5,8016
"02","11","Marshall ","Damn me and my heightened other senses. Must be strong. Okay, I'll be back here at 5:00. Save me at least 20 cookies and do not clean the bowl. Was that a reindeer? I don't want to know!",6,8017
"02","11","Lily ","Hey, look. Our old answering machine.",7,8018
"02","11","Ted ","Oh, yeah. After you left, we, uh, we unplugged it because it reminded Marshall of how you used to, you know, leave messages. But hey, you guys are back together. I say we're plugging it back in. It's good to have you back.",8,8019
"02","11","Lily ","Thanks. Oh, hey, look, there's still some messages on here.",9,8020
"02","11","Ted's father"," Hey Ted, it's Dad calling to check in. I'm going fishing this",10,8021

"02","11",NA,"Ted (voix dans le répondeur): Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the couch right now moping about Lily? You are, aren't you? Well, stop it. She's not worth it. You gotta get over that Grinch.",12,8023
"02","11","Ted (voix off) ","But I didn't say ""Grinch."" I said a bad word. A very, very bad word.",13,8024
"02","11","Ted ","Oh, fudge.",14,8025
"02","11","Ted (voix off) ","But I didn't say fudge.",15,8026

"02","11","Ted ","I-- That was Barney, that was Barney.",17,8028
"02","11","Lily ","That was you, Ted.",18,8029
"02","11","Ted ","That was Marshall.",19,8030
"02","11","Lily ","Marshall left a message for Marshall?",20,8031
"02","11","Ted ","You know, it may have been me, but it was so long ago. Man, that machine, it really garbles your voice.You know, it almost made it sound like I said...",21,8032
"02","11","Lily ","Why would you call me that?",22,8033
"02","11","Ted (voix off) ","It was a fair question. Marshall's breakup with Lily had sent him into a deep depression and nothing could get him out of it. Until one day...",23,8034
"02","11","Marshall ","She was perfect. I lost the perfect woman. I should have knocked her up when I had the chance.",24,8035
"02","11","Ted ","Okay. That's it. You're never going to get over her until you stop putting her on a pedestal. So no more ice cream until you tell me one thing that's wrong with Lily.",25,8036
"02","11","Marshall ","There's only one of her?",26,8037
"02","11","Ted ","Okay. She called off your wedding and dumped you to be a painter in San Francisco. What do you call that?",27,8038
"02","11","Marshall ","Fiercely independent? Brave? I guess it was a little selfish.",28,8039
"02","11","Ted ","There you go.",29,8040
"02","11","Ted (voix off) ","And in almost no time, that spark turned into a roaring fire.",30,8041
"02","11","Marshall ","Yeah. No, you're right. Lily would laugh at anything.",31,8042
"02","11","Barney ","She'd give it up for a bad pun. I'm telling you, she's a laugh slut.",32,8043
"02","11","Ted ","Remember that time we heard her laughing and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's, but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?",33,8044
"02","11","Barney ","And her art? ""I'm Lily, I'm an artist."" She doesn't even own a beret.",34,8045
"02","11","Marshall ","Yeah, and if she's such a great ""artist,"" why does she suck at Pictionary? Who draws a ninja star like a Star of David? Right, right?",35,8046
"02","11","Ted ","Yeah!",36,8047
"02","11","Marshall ","Another round!",37,8048
"02","11","Ted ","I was trying to help him. I'm his best friend. That's the best friend's job.",38,8049

"02","11","Ted ","Yeah.",40,8051
"02","11","Robin ","Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy boy.",41,8052
"02","11","Ted ","Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word.",42,8053
"02","11","Barney ","Then why don't you say it now?",43,8054
"02","11","Ted ","Grinch. You timed that didn't you?",44,8055
"02","11","Barney ","Perfectly.",45,8056
"02","11","Robin ","Well, at least you apologized. You apologized, didn't you?",46,8057
"02","11","Ted ","Oh, yeah. ""I'm sorry"" were the first words out of my mouth.",47,8058
"02","11","Ted ","I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing. I was just trying to put the guy back together. You smashed him to pieces.",48,8059
"02","11","Lily ","Are you seriously not going to apologize for leaving that message?",49,8060
"02","11","Ted ","No!",50,8061
"02","11","Lily ","Why not?",51,8062
"02","11","Ted ","Because, Lily, this summer, you were kind of a Grinch.",52,8063

"02","11","Barney ","Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy?",60,8071
"02","11","Ted ","No, I meant do you have a cold?",61,8072
"02","11","Barney ","I'm fine. I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome and I had to get some of it out. Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time when people are lonely and desperate. It's the most wonderful time of the year.",62,8073
"02","11","Ted ","I should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve.",63,8074
"02","11","Robin ","Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses? If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays.",64,8075
"02","11","Barney ","I don't see any mistletoe, but... (He sneezes on her)",65,8076
"02","11","Woman ","Oh! Oh, God!",66,8077

"02","11","Robin ","You sure this is gonna work?",73,8084
"02","11","Ted ","Yeah, this is our thing. In college, whenever I wanted to make up with her, I'd buy her a beer. Cute, right?",74,8085
"02","11","Robin ","Totally. Plus free mug.",75,8086
"02","11","Ted (voix off) ","Usually that would've done the trick, but it turned out this was a problem not even alcohol could solve. Actually the beer helped a little.",76,8087
"02","11","Ted ","She took the decorations. She took the decorations! What a Grinch!",77,8088
"02","11","Ted (voix off) ","That time I did say ""Grinch.""",78,8089

"02","11","Barney ","Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north, let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body. You see, whenever I start feeling sick, I just stop being sick and be awesome instead. True story.

"02","11","Lily ","Hey, you tricked me.",141,8152
"02","11","Ted ","You really thought I was the pizza delivery guy?",142,8153
"02","11","Lily ","No, I knew it was you. I just thought you'd at least bring a pizza.",143,8154
"02","11","Ted ","Yeah, well, I brought a beer, but I gave it to a homeless guy. All right, he took it from me. Now, will you please come home?",144,8155
"02","11","Lily ","No, I'm not spending Christmas with you.",145,8156
"02","11","Ted ","Okay, I'm sorry for calling you a... that word, over the summer, and for saying it again today. And for thinking it a lot on the subway ride over. I had no right to say that. It was hurtful and immature and I'm sorry.",146,8157
"02","11","Lily ","Oh, shut up. You think I don't know your fake apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh? You're clearly still mad at me.",147,8158
"02","11","Ted ","I'm not mad at you.",148,8159
"02","11","Lily ","Yes, you are.",149,8160
"02","11","Ted ","I am not mad at you, Lily. Now, can we please just...",150,8161
"02","11","Lily ","I've apologized to Marshall and he's forgiven me and we've moved passed it. Why can't you?",151,8162
"02","11","Ted ","Because you never apologized to me. Marshall's not the only one you walked out on. You leave for three months, you don't even call. Come on, Lily, we're supposed to be friends!",152,8163
"02","11","Lily ","Yeah, some friend, you called me a Grinch.",153,8164
"02","11","Ted ","You were a Grinch!",154,8165
"02","11","Lily ","How can you...",155,8166
"02","11","Ted ","Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.",156,8167
"02","11","Lily ","Happy? Now, you've pissed off the big guy upstairs.",157,8168
"02","11","Ted ","Yeah, I'm sure God cares if I...",158,8169
"02","11","Voice ","You use that language again and I'll turn off your water!",159,8170
"02","11","Lily ","That's my super. He lives above me. Great. Thanks to your filthy mouth, now I'm going to have Christmas alone in the dark.",160,8171
"02","11","Ted ","Fine. I don't want to ruin Christmas. You can have the apartment. Don't worry about seeing me there I'll be in Staten Island with my cousin Stacy. Just.... Merry Christmas.",161,8172
"02","11","Robin (on the phone) ","You're spending Christmas Eve with your family? Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry.",162,8173
"02","11","Ted ","Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird. You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees. And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name when he wants to trick us.",163,8174
"02","11","Robin ","Well, do you want me to go with you?",164,8175
"02","11","Ted ","Was that a sincere offer?",165,8176
"02","11","Robin ","First tell me your answer.",166,8177
"02","11","Ted ","Stay there. Save yourself. We'll spend all day together tomorrow. Okay. Oh, how's Barney feeling?",167,8178
"02","11","Robin ","You mean the whiney bottomless pit of neediness? He was bugging me, so I spiked his echinacea tea with codeine.",168,8179
"02","11","Ted ","You're gonna be a great mom.",169,8180
"02","11","Marshall ","Holy crap, the magical Christmas season is upon us. And thank God we don't pay for utilities.",170,8181
"02","11","Lily ","Merry Christmas! What's in the box?",171,8182
"02","11","Marshall ","Only the best present for the best girl ever. It took me all day to track it down.",172,8183
"02","11","Lily ","I thought you were writing a paper.",173,8184
"02","11","Marshall ","Ah, naw, I blew that off. I'll get an extension. School's not important. What is that pitter patter on the roof? Could it be the sound of an awesome Christmas story about to come down the chimney? Why, yes, it is. 'Twas the day before Christmas...",174,8185
"02","11","Marshall ","It was supposed to arrive, like, five days ago, but then it got lost and rerouted. I checked two other branches, finally they told me it was here.",175,8186
"02","11","Women ","Yeah, all I needed to know was the tracking number. Looks like it's headed out to our regional branch in Poughkeepsie.",176,8187
"02","11","Marshall ","What?No, no, no, no,I need that package today.",177,8188
"02","11","Women ","Listen, the truck already left five minutes ago so unless you want to run after it...",178,8189
"02","11","Marshall ","Stop! Stop! Stop, please, stop. Stop. Stop the truck. I need a package on your truck. Can I please take a look in back?",179,8190
"02","11","Truck driver"," Sure. But I gotta keep driving my route. I'm running behind.",180,8191
"02","11","Truck driver"," My bad.",181,8192
"02","11","Marshall ","I'm okay. (out of the truck) Hey, man, thanks for helping me make my fiancee's Christmas.",182,8193
"02","11","Truck driver"," No problem. Too bad I can't deliver all these packages by the end of the day.",183,8194
"02","11","Marshall ","Wait, so some people aren't going to get their gifts in time for Christmas?",184,8195
"02","11","Truck driver"," Sadly, no.",185,8196
"02","11","Marshall ","We delivered every single package on that truck. But I still have one package left to give. Yeah, I did. Merry Christmas. Open it, Baby.",186,8197
"02","11","Lily ","Okay. Oh, my God. An Easy Bake Oven! I've wanted one of these ever since I was a little girl. In this exact model. I never told you that. How did you know?",187,8198
"02","11","Marshall ","It's our first Christmas since we got back together. I want to get her something really special. So I'm getting her a jukebox.",188,8199
"02","11","Ted ","Wow, that's a great gift.",189,8200
"02","11","Marshall ","Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum.",190,8201
"02","11","Ted ","Oh, man, I know something you could get her that would blow her mind. Ready? Eight years ago...",191,8202
"02","11","Lily ","When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven. I begged and I begged, but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles.",192,8203
"02","11","Ted ","Easy Bake Oven--that's what I'm going to call my van.",193,8204
"02","11","Ted ","Dude... how was the concert?",194,8205
"02","11","Marshall ","I couldn't find the outside.",195,8206
"02","11","Lily ","I can't believe Ted remembered after all these years.",196,8207
"02","11","Marshall ","Yeah, and after all that weed. Where is he anyway?",197,8208
"02","11","Lily ","Staten Island.",198,8209
"02","11","Marshall ","Why?",199,8210
"02","11","Ted ","Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents.",200,8211
"02","11","A kid"," Like the gift of God's love?",201,8212
"02","11","Ted ","No, dude, real presents.",202,8213
"02","11","Kid ","Uncle Ted got us presents!",203,8214
"02","11","Stacy ","That's okay, Ted, we'll just give them to charity.",204,8215
"02","11","Charity ","Yay!",205,8216
"02","11","Stacy ","Uh, not you, Charity. I meant the less fortunate. Ted, how would you like to say grace tonight?",206,8217
"02","11","Ted ","Uh, you know what, why don't you say it. I really wouldn't know what to say.",207,8218
"02","11","Charity ","Why don't you recite your favorite passage of scripture.",208,8219
"02","11","Ted ","That's a great idea, Charity. But, really, I don't know. I mean how do you choose your favorite passage? It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones... That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool. Doorbell rings. Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in.",209,8220
"02","11","Charity ","Dear, Father, thank you for this day, and thank you for bringing this family together. Amen.",210,8221
"02","11","Stacy ","Who is it, Ted?",211,8222
"02","11","Ted ","Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers. Marshall starts singing. Robin and Barney follow.",212,8223
"02","11","Lily ","I came here to apologize. I'm so sorry, Ted.",213,8224
"02","11","Ted ","I accept. Give me the beer. it is so good to see you guys.",214,8225
"02","11","Lily ","Are you coming home?",215,8226
"02","11","Ted ","Totally. But first, Lily, I owe you an apology.",216,8227
"02","11","Lily ","Oh, for the love of God, are you as sick of apologies as I am?",217,8228
"02","11","Ted ","Yes",218,8229
"02","11","Lily ","Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving?",219,8230
"02","11","Ted ","Yes. And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again.",220,8231
"02","11","Lily ","That's okay. I was kind of a Grinch.",221,8232
"02","11","Ted ","Nothing. It's something you shouldn't say.",222,8233
"02","11","Kid ","Mom, what's a Grinch?",223,8234
"02","11","Both kids"," Grinch, Grinch, Grinch...",224,8235
"02","11","Ted ( to the family) ","Merry Christmas, everybody. Ted takes his coat and leaves (to his friends) Run, run.",225,8236
"02","11","Marshall ","Merry Christmas, Marshall.",226,8237
"02","12",NA,"Ted (V.O.): Kids, you remember my first day with Robin.",1,8238
"02","12","Ted ","I think I'm in love with you.",2,8239
"02","12","Robin ","What?!",3,8240
"02","12","Ted (voix off) ","Well, here's the thing, normal people, you know, people who aren't your dad, usually take longer to say ""I love you."" Robin went through the usual stages.",4,8241
"02","12","Robin ","Spider! Spider!",5,8242
"02","12","Barney ","I left something in the hallway.",6,8243
"02","12","Ted ","Where?",7,8244
"02","12","Robin ","Right there.",8,8245
"02","12","Ted ","Got it.",9,8246
"02","12","Ted (voix off) ","First there's the moment when you think you think it.",10,8247
"02","12","Ted ","Whoa, still alive.",11,8248
"02","12","Ted (voix off) ","There's the moment you think you know it.",12,8249
"02","12",NA,"Robin is sick and in bed: ",13,8250
"02","12","Robin ","Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick.",14,8251
"02","12","Ted ","Totally worth it.",15,8252
"02","12","Ted (voix off) ","There's the moment where you know you know it, but you can't yet say it.",16,8253
"02","12","Ted ","All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow?",17,8254
"02","12","Robin ","Good night.",18,8255
"02","12","Ted ","Good night.",19,8256
"02","12","Robin ","Wait, Ted?",20,8257
"02","12","Ted ","Yeah?",21,8258
"02","12","Robin ","Good night.",22,8259
"02","12","Robin ","Well, great, I'll see you then. Bye, sweetie. (To Ted) Hey. Guess what? My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend. She gets in on Thursday.",23,8260
"02","12","Ted ","That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.",24,8261
"02","12","Robin ","Really? You'd do that?",25,8262
"02","12","Ted ","Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building.",26,8263
"02","12","Ted (voix off) ","And then there's the moment where you know you know it, and you can't keep it in any longer.",27,8264
"02","12","Robin ","Ted.",28,8265
"02","12","Ted ","Yeah?",29,8266
"02","12","Robin ","Falafel.",30,8267
"02","12","Lily ","Falafel?",31,8268
"02","12","Robin ","Falafel.",32,8269
"02","12","Lily ","Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said ""falafel""?",33,8270
"02","12","Robin ","I totally choked.",34,8271
"02","12","Lily ","I just don't get it. Why can't you tell Ted you love him?",35,8272
"02","12","Robin ","Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.",36,8273
"02","12","Lily ","Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before. No.",37,8274
"02","12","Robin ","Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit.",38,8275
"02","12","Lily ","Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.",39,8276
"02","12","Barney ","Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway.",40,8277
"02","12","Marshall ","Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus.",41,8278
"02","12","Barney ","No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have s*x, you exit when she's in the shower.",42,8279
"02","12","Robin ","So every girl you have s*x with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that.",43,8280
"02","12","Barney ","The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars.",44,8281
"02","12","Ted ","What?",45,8282
"02","12","Barney ","Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, ""Are we there yet?""",46,8283
"02","12","Robin ","So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit.",47,8284
"02","12","Lily ","Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall.",48,8285
"02","12","Robin ","It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.",49,8286
"02","12","Lily ","Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing.",50,8287
"02","12","Robin ","Oh, here comes Katie.",51,8288
"02","12","Lily ","Aw, your sister's so cute.",52,8289
"02","12","Robin ","Yeah. This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school, with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack.",53,8290
"02","12","Lily ","Hello, Kitty.",54,8291
"02","12","Robin ","Oh, no. No. No. No.",55,8292
"02","12","Katie ","Hey, Robin. How are you?",56,8293
"02","12","Robin ","Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person?",57,8294
"02","12","Katie ","Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle.",58,8295
"02","12","Kyle ","Looks like hotness runs in the family.",59,8296
"02","12","Robin ","Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...?",60,8297
"02","12","Katie ","Two whole months.",61,8298
"02","12","Kyle ","Yeah.",62,8299
"02","12","Katie ","He's actually coming to visit family in New York, too. Isn't that great?",63,8300
"02","12","Kyle ","My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad, but he buys me beer, so...",64,8301
"02","12","Robin ","That's cool. This is my friend Lily.",65,8302
"02","12","Kyle ","Hot.",66,8303
"02","12","Robin ","You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled.",67,8304
"02","12","Katie ","Um, actually, I'm going to stay with Kyle tonight.",68,8305
"02","12","Robin ","Uh, no, you're not.",69,8306
"02","12","Katie ","Oh, come on. It's kind of a special night. If you know what I mean.",70,8307
"02","12","Robin ","What? Oh. Oh...",71,8308
"02","12","Robin "," I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a......douche with a faux hawk. This can't happen. You guys have to help me talk her out of it.",72,8309
"02","12","Marshall ","Speech to talk a girl out of having s*x.",73,8310
"02","12","Ted ","Yeah, I don't have any of those.",74,8311
"02","12","Barney ","Discouraging premarital s*x is against my religion.",75,8312
"02","12","Robin ","Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.",76,8313
"02","12","Lily ","It's 2:00 and you've already had three scotch and sodas.",77,8314
"02","12","Robin ","That's why I need your help.",78,8315
"02","12","Ted (voix off) ","Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night. And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building.",79,8316
"02","12","Ted ","You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun",80,8317
"02","12","fact number one"," When construction began on March 17, 1930, the framework rose at a rate of four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. There it is. There it is. Come on. These are fun facts, guys, let's have fun with them.",81,8318
"02","12","Robin ","You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special.",82,8319
"02","12","Katie ","Oh, here we go.",83,8320
"02","12","Lily ","Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either. But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancee.",84,8321
"02","12","Marshall ","Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school. It's totally cool to wait. And stay away from drugs... other than pot.",85,8322
"02","12","Katie ","You told them?",86,8323
"02","12","Robin ","Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?",87,8324
"02","12","All ","Totally. You should wait.",88,8325
"02","12","Barney ","s*x is fun.",89,8326
"02","12","Robin ","See?",90,8327
"02","12","Katie ","You are such a hypocrite. You were only 16 when you lost yours.",91,8328
"02","12","Robin ","Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room.",92,8329
"02","12","Barney ","I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.",93,8330
"02","12","Katie ","Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now. It's like forever. I mean, we've already done everything else. I mean, we've even...",94,8331
"02","12","Robin ","Oh. La, la, la, la, la.La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la, la, la, la.",95,8332
"02","12","Marshall ","Even Kyle gets to do that.",96,8333
"02","12","Katie ","You have no right to tell me not to do it.",97,8334
"02","12","Robin ","But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted.",98,8335
"02","12","Katie ","Robin, this is happening. Look, I already put it up on my Myspace page. I need a clove.",99,8336
"02","12","Robin ","You smoke now, too?",100,8337
"02","12","Lily ","Oh, remember cloves?",101,8338
"02","12","Marshall ","No!",102,8339
"02","12","Robin ","No ""Aw, remember cloves?"" This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having s*x.",103,8340
"02","12","Ted ","Come on, you were only 16 when you had s*x. I was 17.",104,8341
"02","12","Marshall ","We were 18.",105,8342
"02","12","Ted ","Barney was probably 12.",106,8343
"02","12","Barney ","Good one, Ted. I was, uh, six... fourt... How old were you again?",107,8344
"02","12","Ted ","17.",108,8345
"02","12","Barney ","Dude, me, too.",109,8346
"02","12","Lily ","Barney, you okay?",110,8347
"02","12","Barney ","Yeah, of course. What, you don't believe me? - It was at camp, so I'm...",111,8348
"02","12","Marshall ","What camp?",112,8349
"02","12","Barney ","This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer.",113,8350
"02","12","Robin ","What did you teach?",114,8351
"02","12","Barney ","Uh, dance.",115,8352
"02","12","Ted ","Dance?",116,8353
"02","12","Barney ","Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.",117,8354
"02","12","Barney ","Sylvia",118,8355
"02","12","Sylvia ","Yes, Mickey?",119,8356
"02","12","Barney ","How you call your loverboy?",120,8357
"02","12","Sylvia ","Come here, loverboy",121,8358
"02","12","Barney ","And if he doesn't answer",122,8359
"02","12","Sylvia ","Oh, loverboy",123,8360
"02","12","Barney ","And if he still doesn't answer?",124,8361
"02","12","Sylvia ","I simply say, baby... Oh, baby. My sweet baby",125,8362
"02","12","Lily ","That's Dirty Dancing.",126,8363
"02","12","Ted ","It was on last night.",127,8364
"02","12","Marshall ","No, it was two nights ago. ""She's Like the Wind"" has been stuck in my brain for about 40 hours. I just got it out. Now it's back in. Damn you, Swayze!",128,8365
"02","12","Lily ","Do you remember our first time?",129,8366
"02","12","Marshall ","Yeah. It was back in college.",130,8367
"02","12","Lily ","Oh, wait, wait. Look... I really want to do this, but... we should make it special, you know? Do this right.",131,8368
"02","12","Marshall ","Okay. You're right. Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend.",132,8369
"02","12","Lily ","Yeah, New Year's Eve.",133,8370
"02","12","Marshall ","Okay.",134,8371
"02","12","Lily ","Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music.",135,8372
"02","12","Marshall ","That's not a good idea.",136,8373
"02","12","Lily ","Why not?",137,8374
"02","12","Marshall ","Long story. But maybe we could put on some Al Green and take a bubble bath together.",138,8375
"02","12","Lily ","Oh, yeah, that sounds so good. Oh, I love you, Marshall. I'm so glad we're waiting. (12 minutes later): Oops. End of flashback.",139,8376
"02","12","Robin ","Oh, that's adorable.",140,8377
"02","12","Ted ","Yeah, tell her what happened next.",141,8378
"02","12","Marshall ","That was amazing.",142,8379
"02","12","Lily ","Yeah. Want to do it again?",143,8380
"02","12","Ted (on the bed of the top) ","Please don't. End of flashback.",144,8381
"02","12","Marshall ","We said we were sorry.",145,8382
"02","12","Ted ","Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?",146,8383
"02","12","Marshall ","You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.",147,8384
"02","12","Lily ","The point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.",148,8385
"02","12","Robin ","Well, mine was terrible.",149,8386
"02","12","Lily ","Wait, I've never heard your story.",150,8387
"02","12","Robin ","Well, as you know, I was 16. And it was with my boyfriend Brian.",151,8388
"02","12","Brian ","Ready?",152,8389
"02","12","Robin ","Yeah.",153,8390
"02","12","Brian ","This feels so right.",154,8391
"02","12","Robin ","Oh, I know.",155,8392
"02","12","Brian ","Oh, Robin.",156,8393
"02","12","Robin ","Oh, Brian.",157,8394
"02","12","Brian ","Yeah, I'm gay. End of flashback.",158,8395
"02","12","Lily ","I'm so sorry.",159,8396
"02","12","Robin ","Eh, I should've known. There were signs.",160,8397
"02","12","Brian ","Oh, my God! My mom's home. Quick! Get under my bed.",161,8398
"02","12","Robin ","What?! Oh, my God!",162,8399
"02","12","Robin ","You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had s*x, it counts.",163,8400
"02","12","Lily ","What do you mean just barely?",164,8401
"02","12","Robin ","Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end.",165,8402
"02","12","Lily "," Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count.",166,8403
"02","12","Robin ","Yes, it does.",167,8404
"02","12","Lily ","No, it doesn't.",168,8405
"02","12","Marshall ","Yes, it does.",169,8406
"02","12","Lily ","No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story.",170,8407
"02","12","Barney ","Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot. Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water?",171,8408
"02","12","Marshall ","No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter?",172,8409
"02","12","Barney ","Who's Scooter?",173,8410
"02","12","Lily ","My high school boyfriend, who I did not have s*x with.",174,8411
"02","12","Marshall ","I... I can't believe this. We're Marshall and Lily, when people see us, they say, ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other.""",175,8412
"02","12","Barney ","No, Marshall, they say, (with a sad voice) ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other.""",176,8413
"02","12","Marshall ","But now that's not true anymore, now you've had s*x with twice as many people as I have. I knew that you were too good at it.",177,8414
"02","12","Katie ","Know what? I don't want to see the stupid Empire State Building anymore.",178,8415
"02","12","Ted ","It's not stupid.",179,8416
"02","12","Katie ","I'm going to see Kyle.",180,8417
"02","12","Robin ","Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once. You should only be having s*x with someone who's special.",181,8418
"02","12","Katie ","Oh, please, you've had s*x with, like, a hundred guys.",182,8419
"02","12","Robin ","It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys.",183,8420
"02","12","Katie ","I'm sure you were madly in love with all of them.",184,8421
"02","12","Robin ","I had different levels of feeling for each of the... very reasonable number of guys.",185,8422
"02","12","Katie ","Really. Well, do you love Ted? Do you love Ted?",186,8423
"02","12","Robin ","I, um...",187,8424
"02","12","Ted ","Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 22: The Empire State Building has tons of places where people can have private conversations. ( goes away with Robin) You're off the hook, okay?",188,8425
"02","12","Robin ","Just let me explain.",189,8426
"02","12","Ted ","You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine.",190,8427
"02","12","Robin ","Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying... ""hm hm hm"" is like... getting into the carpool lane. And I don't want to take an exit, but... at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane. Because what's in the carpool lane? Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get...",191,8428
"02","12","Ted ","Okay, Robin, Robin, stop. It's no big deal, you don't have to say it.",192,8429
"02","12","Robin ","It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.",193,8430
"02","12","Ted ","What, you mean like I did?",194,8431
"02","12","Robin ","No. I didn't... Yeah, like you did. I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird.",195,8432
"02","12","Ted ","Weird... or courageous?",196,8433
"02","12","Robin ","Pretty sure weird. I mean, who gives it up on the first date?",197,8434
"02","12","Ted ","Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight.",198,8435
"02","12","Robin ","No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut.",199,8436
"02","12","Ted ","Well, then you're an I-love-you prude. You know what? I take mine back.",200,8437
"02","12","Robin ","You... What?",201,8438
"02","12","Ted ","I take my ""I love you"" back.",202,8439
"02","12","Robin ","You can't take it back.",203,8440
"02","12","Ted ","Nah. Just did. Got it right here. But, you know, I'm such a slut. I'm just gonna give it away. Hey, you, sir. I love you.",204,8441
"02","12","Man ","Thank you, man. I was going up there to jump. (the man hugs Ted)",205,8442
"02","12","Lily ","Marshall, why is this such a big deal?",206,8443
"02","12","Marshall ","Why is this such a big deal? Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus, guess who actually discovered the New World. Some dude named Scooter. Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong, it actually goes like this: ""One small step for man, one giant leap for Scooter."" Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve before you did...",207,8444
"02","12","Lily ","Okay, Marshall, I get it.",208,8445
"02","12","Marshall ","It's a big deal because it rewrites our history.",209,8446
"02","12","Lily ","No, it doesn't. Look, have you been to the Empire State Building? No. You've only been in the lobby. People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby. They buy tickets to get to the top. Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count.",210,8447
"02","12","Marshall ","Really. Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building?",211,8448
"02","12","Marshall ","Thank you, sir. You're a very wise and brilliant man.",212,8449
"02","12","Man ","You're right. Why would I throw that all away? I'm having the best day!",213,8450
"02","12","Robin ","Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place to lecture you on romantic relationships, but... but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made.",214,8451
"02","12","Katie ","Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay.",215,8452
"02","12","Robin ","That's not what I meant. I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up. Please don't do this.",216,8453
"02","12",NA,"Ted (V.O.) : But, kids, later that night, Katie did it, and she got pregnant... with quintuplets... and she lived out her days in a trailer park... where she died an alcoholic. So the moral here, kids, don't have s*x until you're married. Maybe even, like, a year or two into marriage.",217,8454
"02","12","His kids"," Dad!",218,8455
"02","12","The girl"," Come on, what really happened?",219,8456
"02","12",NA,"Ted (V.O.): All right, here's what really happened.",220,8457
"02","12","Robin ","Hey.",221,8458
"02","12","Ted ","Hey.",222,8459
"02","12","Robin ","She didn't do it.",223,8460
"02","12","Ted ","Hey, that's great! You got through to her.",224,8461
"02","12","Robin ","No, I didn't. You did. She told me that you talked to her.",225,8462
"02","12","Ted ","Hey, Katie.",226,8463
"02","12","Katie ","Hey. Got another Empire State Building fun fact for me?",227,8464
"02","12","Ted ","No. I wouldn't bore you with the seven million man-hours it took to build this 102-story testament to human will. So, you okay?",228,8465
"02","12","Katie ","I don't know what everyone is freaking out about. Kyle, he's a really nice guy. He could've cheated on me with my lab partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't. 'Cause he said he knew I'd find out.",229,8466
"02","12","Ted ","That's very gallant. Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either. - I was your age my first time.",230,8467
"02","12","Katie ","Oh, really?",231,8468
"02","12","Ted ","Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, it was with this girl, Molly.",232,8469
"02","12","Molly ","I love you, Ted.",233,8470
"02","12","Ted ","Oh, I love you, too, Molly. (Voix off ) But I didn't.",234,8471
"02","12","Molly ","That was amazing.",235,8472
"02","12","Ted ","Look, I got to go.",236,8473
"02","12","Molly ","Where are you going?",237,8474
"02","12","Ted ","My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome.",238,8475
"02","12","Molly ","Well, will you call me?",239,8476
"02","12","Ted ","Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you. (Voix off) But I didn't. Molly?",240,8477
"02","12","Molly ","Yeah?",241,8478
"02","12","Ted ","Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.(Voix off) But I didn't.",242,8479
"02","12","Ted ","And I never saw her again. I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have s*x. I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and... that's exactly what I did. Look, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like. Even the nice ones.",243,8480
"02","12","Katie ","So I told Kyle I wanted to wait... and he dumped me.",244,8481
"02","12","Robin ","Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Aw, honey. I promise everything is gonna be okay. You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo?",245,8482
"02","12","Katie ","Only if you put a buttload of Kahlua in it.",246,8483
"02","12","Robin ","Don't tell Mom.",247,8484
"02","12","Robin ","Thanks for doing that.",248,8485
"02","12","Ted ","You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you.",249,8486
"02","12","Robin ","But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you.",250,8487
"02","12","Ted ","Yeah, well...",251,8488
"02","12","Ted ","I love you, Molly.",252,8489
"02","12","Molly ","Oh, I love you, too, Ted.",253,8490
"02","12","Ted ","Wow. That was amazing.",254,8491
"02","12","Molly "," Look, I got to go.",255,8492
"02","12","Ted ","Wh-Where are you going?",256,8493

"02","12","Molly ","Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.",261,8498
"02","12","Ted ","But she didn't.",262,8499
"02","12","Robin ","Oh, come here. I love you. I said it. Feels right. I love you.",263,8500
"02","12","Ted ","I'm gay. I'm kidding. I love you, too. Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity.",264,8501
"02","12","Robin ","Yeah. I guess I was just waiting for the right guy.",265,8502
"02","12","Ted (voix off) ","Katie ended up having a great first time in New York. And the last thing we did before she left was go to the Empire State Building.",266,8503
"02","12","Ted ","I am so glad we're finally doing this.",267,8504
"02","12","Barney ","What are you talking about? We were here yesterday.",268,8505
"02","12","Marshall ","Yeah, but that didn't really count. Oh, crap.",269,8506
"02","12","Lily ","Exactly! So yesterday doesn't count as having gone to the Empire State Building. So I lost it to you, Marshall. And I rode that elevator to the top, and I saw that view, and I basked in the awesomeness. And that's our story.",270,8507
"02","12","Marshall ","Yeah. Yeah, that's our story. We've only had s*x with each other.",271,8508
"02","12","Lily ","We've only had s*x with each other.",272,8509
"02","12","Barney ","They've only had s*x with each other.",273,8510
"02","12","Ted ","Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go. Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 81: There are 1,860 steps from this... (They push him outside the elevator) Whoa, whoa! Come on!",274,8511
"02","12","Ted ","So, now you guys can finally say you've been to the Empire State Building. How have you lived here so long and never been to the top?",275,8512
"02","12","Marshall ","Well, we're usually busy... drinking.",276,8513
"02","12","Lily ","Speaking of first times, we never got to hear your virginity story.",277,8514
"02","12","Marshall ","That's right, I almost forgot.",278,8515
"02","12","Barney ","Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout...",279,8516
"02","12","Marshall ","Fast Times at Ridgemont High.",280,8517
"02","12","Barney ","I mean, I was in a subway with a high-priced call girl...",281,8518
"02","12","Ted ","Risky Business.",282,8519
"02","12","Barney ","I was accidentally hacking into NORAD'S computer...",283,8520
"02","12","Ted ","That's War Games, and there's not even a s*x scene in it.",284,8521
"02","12","Barney ","All right! I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda. She called me ""Barry"" the whole time, and for two weeks, my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy?",285,8522
"02","12","Marshall ","Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills.",286,8523
"02","12","Barney ","Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's. Her dad did not approve of our love.",287,8524
"02","12","Ted ","Did anyone put Baby in a corner?",288,8525
"02","12","Barney ","Oh, God, no. What can I say, I... had... the time of my life. True story.",289,8526
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","Some kids dream of being astronauts. Some kids dream of playing baseball. When I was a kid, I had only one dream. To build a skyscraper.",1,8527
"02","13","Boy ","That's stupid. (he destroys Ted's tower.)",2,8528
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","There were some obstacles along the way. But eventually my dream came true. I became an architect.",3,8529
"02","13","Ted ","Morning, everyone! So, I had an idea for the atrium. Ready? Columns.",4,8530
"02","13",NA,"Mr. Druthers: That's stupid. (he destroys his model)",5,8531
"02","13","Ted ","I... I can't believe you knocked over my model.",6,8532
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Well, it's just... it's not exactly new, is it-- columns? I mean, what's your next groundbreaking idea-- ceilings? Floors? Windows?",7,8533
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","I know what you're thinking: Who's this jerk? Well, this jerk was Hammond Druthers, a legend in the architecture community. Very big in the '80s. He was also far and away the worst boss I ever had. Then I designed the Spokane National Bank Building. And suddenly... I was his boss. - And he didn't like it.",8,8534
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Stairs?",9,8535
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either. See, before, when I was just another employee, I was happy, carefree. The guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss.",10,8536
"02","13","Ted ","Did you see what he was wearing today? It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples.",11,8537
"02","13","Co-worker"," Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers, I get hay fever just looking at it.",12,8538
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","But suddenly I was a different guy.",13,8539
"02","13","Ted ","Hey, guys. What's so funny?",14,8540
"02","13","Co-worker"," Nothing. Um... nice shirt.",15,8541
"02","13","Ted ","Thanks.",16,8542
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","The hours were insane. I was always working even when I wasn't at work.",17,8543
"02","13","Ted ","Oh, Robin... I just had a great idea.",18,8544
"02","13","Robin ","Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up.",19,8545
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","Before, I used to be this guy.",20,8546
"02","13","Ted ","Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert. Just say you're sick.",21,8547
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","But now...I was this guy.",22,8548
"02","13","Ted ","Sick, huh? Unbutton your shirt. Hmm... ""Foo Fighters."" Get back to work.",23,8549
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","But still, the worst part was Druthers.",24,8550
"02","13","Ted ","Well, I was thinking...",25,8551
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Ceilings? Oops. Said that already. Then again, you seem to like rehashing old ideas. I'm kidding, of course. Another hole in one, boss.",26,8552
"02","13","Robin ","Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking.",27,8553
"02","13","Ted ","Why would you say that?",28,8554
"02","13","Robin ","Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that.",29,8555
"02","13","Barney ","I have found that to be true.",30,8556
"02","13","Marshall ","It's a blessing and a curse really.",31,8557
"02","13","Lily ","Ted, you can't let him treat you like that.",32,8558
"02","13","Marshall ","Yeah, you gotta ask yourself, who's the boss?",33,8559
"02","13","Ted ","Tony.",34,8560
"02","13","Robin ","Angela.",35,8561
"02","13","Barney ","Mona.",36,8562
"02","13","Robin ","Mona?",37,8563
"02","13","Barney ","Watch it more closely. Rock your world.",38,8564
"02","13","Robin ","So, what are you gonna do?",39,8565
"02","13","Ted ","Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss. So, I went to talk to the managing partner.",40,8566
"02","13","MP ","Fire him.",41,8567
"02","13","Ted ","Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project.",42,8568
"02","13","MP ","Fire him! He's an arrogant, washed-up, pain in the ass. In fact, fire everyone on that project. Druthers, Mosby, the whole lot of them.",43,8569

"02","13","Ted ","Knock yourself out.",47,8573
"02","13","Robin ","Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing. Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?",48,8574
"02","13","Robin ","Vicki, um... I'm so sorry about this, but there's been some budget cuts and, um, we have to let you go. I mean, after tonight. I still need my makeup for the broadcast. So... (Robin on TV wearing a lot of make-up.): Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims.",49,8575

"02","13","Barney ","Do you know about this?",53,8579
"02","13","Ted ","No.",54,8580
"02","13","Robin ","What is that?",55,8581
"02","13","Barney ","Only the greatest thing ever. Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup. If they were to cure cancer tomorrow, this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week. Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall.",56,8582
"02","13","Ted ","Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared.",57,8583
"02","13","Barney ","I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time.",58,8584
"02","13","Robin ","Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it.",59,8585
"02","13","Barney ","Oh, come on, Robin.",60,8586
"02","13","Robin ","No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun.",61,8587

"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Well, excuse me, for spending the last four hours drawing designs for your building.",65,8591
"02","13","Ted ","This is a cocktail napkin. Covered in profanity. Look, Hammond, um, there's no easy way to say this, so... why don't we just, um, step into your office.",66,8592
"02","13","Employees ","Happy birthday to you.",67,8593
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Oh, you had me. You so had me.",68,8594
"02","13","Robin ","So, you didn't fire him?",69,8595
"02","13","Ted ","I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised.",70,8596
"02","13","Barney ","Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat. I know how much you love stools.",71,8597
"02","13","Marshall ","Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture.",72,8598

"02","13","Marshall ","Okay, all right, so what, you guys found the painting, huh?",82,8608
"02","13","Lily ","I knew this day would come.",83,8609
"02","13","Marshall ","How did you know that?",84,8610
"02","13","Lily ","Because I didn't hide it very well.",85,8611
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","So the story on the painting is that,back in college, Lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class. Marshall wasn't so into the idea.",86,8612
"02","13","Marshall ","Well, I just... don't think that some dude should drop trou just to pose for you.",87,8613
"02","13","Lily ","It's for class, and it's just that weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.",88,8614
"02","13","Marshall ","The frisbee dude with the soul patch? He's like the hottest guy in school!",89,8615
"02","13","Lily ","No, he's actually a little husky...",90,8616
"02","13","Marshall ","Oh, he's just huggable! And complicated... and a little bit of a jerk. Just enough so you think maybe you can change him.",91,8617
"02","13","Lily ","Okay, just forget it.",92,8618
"02","13","Marshall ","Call me old-fashioned, I just think that I'm the only guy you should see naked.",93,8619
"02","13","Lily ","Well, then you'll have to do it.",94,8620
"02","13","Marshall ","Are you kidding me? What if somebody sees it?",95,8621
"02","13","Lily ","We're not in high school anymore. People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting. We're adults now.",96,8622
"02","13","Barney ","We totally saw your butt.",97,8623
"02","13","Marshall ","This painting has caused too much grief already. I'm destroying it right now.",98,8624
"02","13","Barney ","Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall?",99,8625
"02","13","Marshall ","Where is it?",100,8626
"02","13","Barney ","I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three.",101,8627
"02","13","Marshall ","You hung it up in the bar, didn't you?",102,8628
"02","13","Barney ","Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles?",103,8629
"02","13","Ted ","Field trip!",104,8630
"02","13","Barney ","Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar. Classic! What a memorable prank.",105,8631
"02","13","Carl ","Hey, Marshall. What'll you have?",106,8632
"02","13","Marshall ","What'll I have? Um, I don't know, maybe a beer and that nude painting of me hanging behind the bar!",107,8633
"02","13","Carl ","Ooh, I'm sorry, that painting's property of the bar.",108,8634
"02","13","Marshall ","I know that Barney gave you that painting.",109,8635
"02","13","Carl ","I don't know what you're talking about.",110,8636

"02","13","Marshall ","All right, you know what, Carl, you just lost yourself a regular customer.",115,8641
"02","13","Carl ","I doubt it.",116,8642
"02","13","Marshall ","This painting is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.",117,8643
"02","13","Robin ","Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost?",118,8644
"02","13","Barney ","Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse. I've got a five-year rollout plan. I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city. Then, after New York...",119,8645
"02","13","Ted ","One of my worst fears has come true-- I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked. Well, I gotta go. Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office.",120,8646
"02","13","Robin ","Oh, I'll go out with you. Bye, guys.",121,8647
"02","13","Lily ","You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting.",122,8648
"02","13","Barney ","Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall. The painting's actually really great.",123,8649
"02","13","Lily ","Are you serious?",124,8650
"02","13","Barney ","Yeah.",125,8651
"02","13","Lily ","Well, thank you. You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes. What?",126,8652
"02","13","Barney ","Paint me.",127,8653
"02","13","Lily ","What?",128,8654
"02","13","Barney ","Paint me.",129,8655
"02","13","Voice ","Who's that? Who's out there?",130,8656
"02","13","Ted ","Hammond, is that you?",131,8657
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Mosby?",132,8658
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","Druthers and I were alone in the office. If I was gonna fire him, this would be the best chance I'd ever have.",133,8659
"02","13","Mr Druters"," Uh, look, just a second, Ted.",134,8660
"02","13","Ted ","Uh, no, I, I really need to talk to you. Look, there's no easy way to say... What, what are you doing?",135,8661
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," What are you doing?",136,8662
"02","13","Ted ","I'm standing here wearing pants. Are you sleeping here? What's going on?",137,8663
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Okay, fine, yes. Not that it's any of your business but my wife had a little spat a few weeks ago, and I've been sleeping here until she cools off.",138,8664
"02","13","Ted ","Okay, well, uh, you're right-- that is none of my business. Uh, look, there's no easy way to say this-- I...",139,8665
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Who am I kidding? She's never gonna take me back.",140,8666
"02","13","Ted ","It's okay.",141,8667
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," What did you want to say to me?",142,8668
"02","13","Ted ","Happy birthday, buddy. So, you've been living at the office?",143,8669
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Yes. I'm an architect without a home. You see the tragic irony in that?",144,8670
"02","13","Ted ","Yeah, I do.",145,8671
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Cause I design homes.",146,8672
"02","13","Ted ","I see it.",147,8673
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," But I don't have a home.",148,8674
"02","13","Ted ","Not lost on me at all. But I don't understand, why don't you just go to a hotel? You could be sleeping on a mattress instead of... what appears to be torn-up drawings of my building.",149,8675
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Why would I go to a hotel, when any second, she's going to call and tell me to come home. She's a very special lady, Ted. She's quite... mannish. She gives me what I need. Do you understand that?",150,8676
"02","13","Ted ","Uh, no, I don't.",151,8677
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," If you were lost in the wilderness, she can provide for me.",152,8678
"02","13","Ted ","Well, that's the dream.",153,8679
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," I'm glad you came here tonight, Ted.",154,8680
"02","13","Ted ","Me too, Hammond.",155,8681
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Call me Ham.",156,8682
"02","13","Ted ","No, thanks.",157,8683
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Hammy D?",158,8684
"02","13","Ted ","No, I think just Hammond.",159,8685
"02","13","Robin ","So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him.",160,8686
"02","13","Ted ","I was this close.",161,8687
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","Meanwhile, Lily had been up all night in the grips of a dilemma.",162,8688
"02","13","Lily ","Oh honey, you're awake?",163,8689
"02","13","Marshall ","I'm awake. Is everything okay?",164,8690
"02","13","Lily ","Yeah. I've kind of been wrestling with something. What if I told you I had a way to pay for our honeymoon?",165,8691
"02","13","Marshall ","Baby, our honeymoon's already paid for. We're going to Howe Caverns.",166,8692
"02","13","Lily ","Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?",167,8693
"02","13","Marshall ","It's not just a cave, it's a whole labyrinth of caves. It's an underground adventure. There's a cave that's so dark that you don't even know you're in there. I mean, we're going to experience a whole new kind of dark.",168,8694
"02","13","Lily ","Well, what if I found a way to make a little extra money so that we spend our honeymoon not in Howe Caverns, but in Scotland?",169,8695
"02","13","Marshall ","Loch Ness?",170,8696
"02","13","Lily ","Yeah. And you know, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Glasgow...",171,8697
"02","13","Marshall ","Loch Ness. Nessy. Baby, I would love to search for the enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch, but... we can't afford that.",172,8698
"02","13","Lily ","Maybe we can.",173,8699
"02","13","Barney ","Paint me.",174,8700
"02","13","Lily ","Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you?",175,8701
"02","13","Barney ","We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame. I do not. In my body, where the shame gland should be, there's a second awesome gland. True story.",176,8702
"02","13","Lily ","Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting.",177,8703
"02","13","Barney ","Yeah. A nude Barney is a challenge. But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this. Now is the time-- I'm 31. I'm at the peak of my physical beauty. If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago. Long ago.",178,8704
"02","13","Lily ","Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked.",179,8705
"02","13","Barney ","I'll give you $5,000.",180,8706
"02","13","Marshall ","We're going to Loch Ness!",181,8707
"02","13","Lily ","Yeah!",182,8708
"02","13","Ted ","That cabby would not shut up.",183,8709
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Yeah, we should call him a gabby.",184,8710
"02","13","Ted ","I think it, you say it.",185,8711
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Hey, uh... thanks for putting me up last night, buddy. Give 'em hell.",186,8712
"02","13","Ted ","Morning, team. So, I have given it some thought, and I say we revisit columns.",187,8713
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Oh, God, not this again. Ted, a man in a toga just arrived and delivered a parchment. Let me read it: Oh! It's from ancient Greece. They want their basic architectural elements back. Geez.",188,8714
"02","13","Ted ","What?",189,8715
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," You didn't hear me? Toga, parchment...",190,8716
"02","13","Ted ","Can I see you for one second?",191,8717
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Ooh, I'm in trouble now.",192,8718
"02","13","Ted ","What are you doing? I thought we were friends. You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal. I tossed you more toilet paper.",193,8719
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," We are friends. But that doesn't magically make your bad ideas good.",194,8720
"02","13","Ted ","What? I don't believe this! You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes! And my",195,8721
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Ted, I hope that you're not going to let our professional woes interfere with our friendship, because I really kind of need you right now.",196,8722
"02","13","Lily ","Okay, let's get this over with.",197,8723
"02","13","Barney ","Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in. This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art. I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift.",198,8724
"02","13","Lily ","Thank you.",199,8725
"02","13","Barney ","I meant me. Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence. Goofy and unburdened, with wit. But me, I want something more regal. Something my progeny could look at and say, ""There's stands Barnabus Stinson."" He was wise... and strong.",200,8726
"02","13","Lily ","I don't think your sword will fit.",201,8727
"02","13","Barney ","I get that a lot.",202,8728
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","And so, as Lily began painting, Marshall thought about the $5,000 and what his fiancee was doing to earn it.",203,8729
"02","13","Marshall ","This isn't right. This isn't right at all.",204,8730
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","Finally, he could take it no more.",205,8731
"02","13","Lily ","Hold still. Hold still. Hold still!",206,8732
"02","13","Barney ","Paint faster!",207,8733
"02","13","Lily ","Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts.",208,8734
"02","13","Barney ","Yeah. Wait, wait! That wasn't enough buildup. I need... In a world without justice, one man...",209,8735
"02","13","Lily ","Oh, just drop them!",210,8736
"02","13","Barney ","All right.",211,8737
"02","13","Marshall ","No! No, this is not right!",212,8738
"02","13","Barney ","We had a deal!",213,8739
"02","13","Marshall ","Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out!",214,8740
"02","13","Barney ","You...!",215,8741
"02","13","Marshall ","It's over! (he closes the door at Barney's face). (Yelling) Lily, I can't let you go through with this! (whispering) I found a castle we can stay in, but it's an extra two grand. (Yelling) It's just not right! (whispering). It's beautiful and they say it's haunted.",216,8742
"02","13","Barney ","Before you say anything, I'll give you an extra five grand.",217,8743
"02","13","Marshall "," We accept.",218,8744
"02","13","Barney ","You people are so easy to control. Dance for me, puppets, dance.",219,8745
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","And that's how Uncle Barney paid for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.",220,8746
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Come on, Ted, listen, why don't we get back and finish drawing the plans for a building which, in my opinion, is never going to get built, so you and I can get out of here and grab a couple of beers.",221,8747
"02","13","Ted ","No. Look, Hammond, there's no easy way to say this but...",222,8748
"02","13","Man ","Looking for Hammond Druthers.",223,8749
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Oh, that's me. I'm Hammond Druthers.",224,8750
"02","13","Man ","These are divorce papers. You've been served.",225,8751
"02","13","Ted ","Oh, God.",226,8752
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," She's really going through with this. So that's it. It's over.",227,8753
"02","13","Ted ","There is no easy way to say this, but...",228,8754
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," She's giving me the remains of Wolfie? My dog is dead? Oh, my God. I can't believe this. She always played too rough with him.",229,8755
"02","13","Ted ","Believe me, there is no easy way to say this...",230,8756
"02","13","Men (singing) ","# Happy birthday to you... #",231,8757
"02","13","Ted ","You've got to be kidding me!",232,8758
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Guys, you have no idea how much this means to me right now.",233,8759
"02","13","Ted ","Wait, his birthday was yesterday!",234,8760
"02","13","Man ","Yeah, but a bunch of us were up at the conference in Montreal, so we thought...",235,8761
"02","13","Ted ","No! No birthday! No! I got something to say and I'm gonna get it out. Hammond, listen to me. I am sorry that your dog died, and that your wife is divorcing you and that... your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday. And there is no easy way to say... What are you doing? What's going on?",236,8762
"02","13","Mr Druthers"," Oh, God...",237,8763
"02","13","Ted ","Oh, come on, you're not going to pull that, are you? Oh! Look, yeah, right. Now we're falling onto the ground. Well, nice try, but guess what? You're fired! You're fired, you get it? You hear me? You're gone! You're fired! (Mr Druthers is taken on a stretcher with an oxygen mask on his face.) In my defense, I think we all suspected Hammond might have been faking. On the plus side, the EMTs seem to think he's going to be just fine and, as you saw, they did admit that I did not cause the heart attack, even if they said it a bit begrudgingly.",238,8764
"02","13","Ted (voix off) ","And there it was, rock bottom: They all hated me. But just when all seemed lost, I had the greatest idea of my entire career.",239,8765
"02","13","Man ","Margarita Fridays--great idea, boss.",240,8766
"02","13","Lily ","Okay, it's done. I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it.",241,8767

"02","14","Marshall ","Wait... tomorrow night at 6:00, that's the Super Bowl.",17,8789
"02","14","Ted ","Okay, I feel terrible, but the truth is we didn't know Mike.",18,8790
"02","14","Lily ","Mark.",19,8791
"02","14","Ted ","Mark, and as long as we send flowers, I can't think of any reason we'd have to Carl (at the bar): Get out of here! I never want to see your face in this bar again! This soulless b*st*rd just told me he can't come to Mark's funeral because he wants to watch the Super Bowl. Could you believe that? You guys are coming, right?",20,8792
"02","14","All ","Yes... Wouldn't miss for the world.",21,8793

"02","14","Ted ","Mark, and start watching only an hour late.",24,8796
"02","14","Marshall ","Okay, that's great, but just to make sure it records, maybe we should bow our heads and say a quiet prayer to the TiVo gods.",25,8797
"02","14","Ted ","Almighty TiVo, we thank you for all the gifts you have given us: the power to freeze live TV to go take a leak is nothing short of Godlike. Let's not forget fast-forwarding through commercials. It seems greedy to ask anything more from you, O magic box, but if you malfunction and miss the Super Bowl, we will destroy you in the",26,8798

"02","14","Robin ","Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute.",32,8804
"02","14","Barney ","Seriously, that's the last time I'm gonna call you today. Okay. Good-bye. You didn't hang up either! I know! You hang up! You hang up! My bookie. Great guy.",33,8805

"02","14","Robin ","Okay, I have to be at work exactly one Super Bowl from now.",46,8818

"02","14","Marshall ","Calm down, buddy.",54,8826
"02","14","Lily ","Oh, commercials!",55,8827
"02","14","Ted ","Everyone drink!",56,8828
"02","14","Ted ","God, this is such a great tradition, all of us watching the game together. How did this start?",57,8829
"02","14","Marshall ","Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks that Casey misses this field goal.",58,8830
"02","14","Barney ","I don't bet. Betting's for suckers.",59,8831
"02","14","Marshall ","Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal.",60,8832
"02","14","Barney ","Fine.",61,8833
"02","14","Marshall ","See, there you go, he made it. You win.",62,8834
"02","14","Barney ","Wait. This is mine, just like that? God, that feels good. No, that feels really... good. What else can we bet on?",63,8835
"02","14","Marshall ","Nothing, it's the halftime show.",64,8836
"02","14","Lily ","Oh, so lame. Nobody even pays attention. I mean, Janet Jackson, who cares?",65,8837
"02","14","Ted ","God, how cool is Robin?",66,8838
"02","14","Marshall ","I can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months to our sacred day. Now she's gonna be in all the pictures.",67,8839
"02","14","Barney ","Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks plus six points for 500 bucks.",68,8840
"02","14","Marshall ","Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.",69,8841
"02","14","Barney ","$50?! What fun is $50?! Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall! Okay, $50.",70,8842
"02","14","Robin ","Hey, I'll take that action. Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand. Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings? Oh, commercials! Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious.",71,8843
"02","14","Ted ","Look, we always watch the Super Bowl together. So we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 6:00 and go the next 18 hours without finding out who won.",72,8844
"02","14","Barney ","That's impossible.",73,8845
"02","14","Ted ","I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy. That means no TV, no Internet, no newspapers, nothing. Media blackout. But our tradition lives on. Who's in?",74,8846
"02","14","Lily ","I'm in.",75,8847
"02","14","Robin ","I'm in.",76,8848
"02","14","Marshall ","I'm in.",77,8849
"02","14","Barney ","What the hell, I'm in. High five!",78,8850
"02","14","Ted ","Dude, we're at a wake.",79,8851
"02","14","Barney ","Sorry. Solemn low five.",80,8852
"02","14","Ted (voix off) ","As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world.",81,8853
"02","14","Barney ","Hey, take this key and swallow it.",82,8854
"02","14","Ted ","What? No.",83,8855
"02","14","Barney ","Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time.",84,8856
"02","14","Ted ","Lots more, no.",85,8857
"02","14","Barney ","I'm not messing around, Theodore. I've got a lot of money riding on this game. If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator, I'll check the score. Please take the key.",86,8858
"02","14","Ted ","Fine. But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan and I think that's funny.",87,8859
"02","14","Ted (voix off) ","The media blackout was particularly hard on Robin because, well, she was the media.",88,8860
"02","14","Robin ","But unfortunately, the City won't be fixing the unusually large pothole any time soon, so buckle up if you're on the BQE. It's gonna be a bumpy one.",89,8861
"02","14","Kevin ","Like morning commutes needed to get any harder.",90,8862
"02","14","Man ","You're right, Kevin.",91,8863
"02","14","Kevin ","Well, Robin, what do you say? I think it's time to check in with Sid for a sports update.",92,8864
"02","14","Robin ","No!",93,8865
"02","14","Kevin ","What?",94,8866
"02","14","Robin ","No.",95,8867
"02","14","Kevin ","But it's, uh, time for Sports.",96,8868
"02","14","Robin ","No, it's not. It's time for Weather.",97,8869
"02","14","Kevin ","We, we just did Weather.",98,8870
"02","14","Robin ","Well, weather's pretty fickle, it may have changed. What's it doing out there, Lou?",99,8871
"02","14","Lou ","Pretty much the same thing it was two minutes ago. Back to you, Robin.",100,8872
"02","14","Kevin ","Okay, now it's time for Sports.",101,8873
"02","14","Robin ","No! Let's go to Traffic Todd in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper.",102,8874
"02","14","Kevin ","Robin, it's time for Sports! Over to you, Sid.",103,8875
"02","14","Sid ","Thank you, Kevin and Robin. Let's talk about the Super Bowl.",104,8876
"02","14","Ted (voix off) ","Weeks earlier, Marshall had promised Lily he'd come into her kindergarten class for show-and-tell day.",105,8877
"02","14","Lily ","And he's a little bit double-jointed... And his favorite animal is the Loch Ness monster.",106,8878
"02","14","Marshall ","Lily, how many times...? Nessie is a gentle creature. We're trying to stay away from terms like ""Monster.""",107,8879
"02","14","Lily ","Well, I think we can all agree, he is much more interesting than Sally's one-eyed goldfish. Three weeks in a row? Come on, Sally. Okay, well, that's all the time we have. Arts and crafts, everybody.",108,8880
"02","14","Doug ","Hey. I'm Doug.",109,8881
"02","14","Marshall ","Oh, hey, I'm Marshall.",110,8882
"02","14","Doug ","Are you going to be staying here for the rest of day?",111,8883
"02","14","Marshall ","Yeah, I'm actually trying to hide out 'cause I don't want to know who won the Super Bowl.",112,8884
"02","14","Doug "," I know who won.",113,8885
"02","14","Marshall ","Oh, um, that's great, but I really don't want to know, so if you could just keep that to yourself.",114,8886
"02","14","Doug ","How badly do you not want to know?",115,8887
"02","14","Marshall ","Excuse me?",116,8888
"02","14","Doug ","Ten bucks.",117,8889
"02","14","Marshall ","Are you serious?",118,8890
"02","14","Doug ","Just went up to eight.",119,8891
"02","14","Barney ","Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries.",120,8892
"02","14","Ted ","Not until game time.",121,8893
"02","14","Barney ","Where are you going?",122,8894
"02","14","Ted ","Pick up the hot wings.",123,8895
"02","14","Barney ","What? How the hell are you planning on getting in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score? There's TVs everywhere.",124,8896
"02","14","Ted ","Ah, don't worry. I got it all planned out. First of all: I placed duct tape on a pair of sunglasses so I can only see out of two tiny holes. Next, I constructed blinders out of an old cereal box. Top it all off: high-tech noise-reducing headphones I bought when Marshall and Lily first got back together and were doing it a lot. I call it the Sensory Deprivator 5000.",125,8897
"02","14","Ted ","Hello! Uh, my name is Ted Mosby. I'm here to pick up my hot wings. In my hand, you'll find the exact total for the wings plus a generous tip. Please take the cash. Put the wings in my hand and I'll be on my way. Thank you!",126,8898
"02","14","Sid ","And that closes the book on one heck of a Super Bowl. Back to you, Kevin and Robin.",127,8899
"02","14","Kevin ","We'll be right back.",128,8900
"02","14","Man ","And we're clear.",129,8901
"02","14","Robin ","I'm sorry.",130,8902
"02","14","Woman ","Um, Robin, is it just me, or were you doing something different there?",131,8903
"02","14","Robin ","I haven't watched the game yet. I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl. I mean, change the teleprompter. No team names, nothing specific.",132,8904
"02","14","Woman ","That is crazy. I can't do that.",133,8905
"02","14","Robin ","My friend Mark passed away this week.",134,8906
"02","14","Woman ","Okay, sweety okay. Okay, I'm so sorry.",135,8907
"02","14","Man ","Back in five... four... three...",136,8908
"02","14","Robin ","It's just so hard.",137,8909
"02","14","Ted ","Ha! Who's the idiot now?! You said the Sensory Deprivator 5000 was stupid. But it totally worked! (barney leaves and Ted doesn't notice.) I couldn't see or hear anything happening around me. Right?! Right?! (He takes his glasses off) No...!",138,8910
"02","14","Ted (voix off) ","And if that weren't bad enough, I was about to have a horrible realization.",139,8911
"02","14","Ted ","Where's the dipping sauce?",140,8912
"02","14","Doug ","The team that won, want to know what their name rhymes with?",141,8913
"02","14","Marshall ","Come on, dude. You promised you'd stop if I ate all those crayons. Why are you doing this?",142,8914
"02","14","Doug ","I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.",143,8915
"02","14","Marshall ","Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin, she's mine.",144,8916
"02","14","Lily ","Okay, now who did this?",145,8917
"02","14","Marshall ","I did.",146,8918
"02","14","Doug ","Does that mean Marshall gets a time-out?",147,8919
"02","14","Lily ","Well, Marshall's a grownup, so...",148,8920
"02","14","Doug ","When one of us breaks something, we get a time-out.",149,8921
"02","14","Lily ","Sorry. Marshall gets a time-out.",150,8922
"02","14","Robin ","And after the Super Bowl, the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up, sending the mayor of the winning team's city 15 pounds of a delicacy his of her city is famous for. Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor.",151,8923
"02","14","Doug ","Hey. Hey.",152,8924
"02","14","Marshall ","I'm not talking to you.",153,8925
"02","14","Doug ","Yes, you are. You'll do whatever I say. Hold your breath.",154,8926
"02","14","Marshall ","I'm not holding my breath.",155,8927
"02","14","Doug ","The winning team was the... (Marshall holds his breath) Now here's how this is going to work: you're going to take me to three R-rated movies a week...",156,8928
"02","14","Ted (voix off) ","And then Uncle Marshall got an idea. It was not one he was proud of in retrospect, but desperate times...",157,8929
"02","14","Marshall ","Oh, no. Somebody wet their pants.",158,8930
"02","14","Doug ","No, I didn't.",159,8931
"02","14","Marshall ","Oh, really? Who's everyone gonna believe? I'm a grownup third-year law student at Columbia and you're just a little pants wetter. So now I ask you a question: You want to be able to quietly sneak off to the restroom and dry off or am I gonna have something for show and tell today? Hey, everyone...",160,8932
"02","14","Doug ","Okay, okay. You win.",161,8933
"02","14","Marshall ","I want my money back. And your pudding snack pack.",162,8934
"02","14","Barney ","Sir, who won the Super Bowl?",163,8935
"02","14","Man ","Sorry. I missed the game.",164,8936
"02","14","Barney ","You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!",165,8937
"02","14","Man 2"," I... don't really follow sports.",166,8938
"02","14","Barney ","Oh, my...! Emmitt Smith! Oh, thank God.",167,8939
"02","14","Emmitt Smith"," Yeah, I get that a lot.",168,8940
"02","14","Barney ","You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?",169,8941
"02","14","Emmitt Smith"," The game was last night? You know, once you win two or three of those things, it's kind of like, eh.",170,8942
"02","14","Barney ","But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?!",171,8943
"02","14","Emmitt Smith"," Dance, my friend. Dance.",172,8944
"02","14","Barney ","No...!",173,8945

"02","14","Barman ","Oh! I didn't recognize you.",175,8947
"02","14","Ted ","Yeah, you forgot to give me the dipping sauce! Ah. Yes. This is the one.",176,8948
"02","14","Ted (voix off) ","It was 4:00, and so far, all of us had done the impossible. But then, almost simultaneously, things started to go wrong.",177,8949
"02","14","Robin ","And let's end the day on a happy note. There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo. Trish Sanchez has the story.",178,8950
"02","14","Man 1"," Hey, buddy.",179,8951
"02","14","Man 2"," Hey, dude, look out.",180,8952

"02","14","Barney (tearing the newspaper) ","No...!",187,8959
"02","14","Ted ","Yes...!",188,8960
"02","14","Ted ","Awesome. Just in time for kick-off. None of you guys found out the score, right?",189,8961
"02","14","Robin ","Mission accomplished.",190,8962
"02","14","Lily ","Didn't find out.",191,8963
"02","14","Ted ","Great. Let's do it. I already fast-forwarded through the four hours of pre-game coverage. So we are ready. (Barney comes in) Barney, I can't even look at you. I don't want any sign of who won.",192,8964
"02","14","Ted ","Don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away. Feel free to start without me. Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! So much money! You screwed it up, Barney! You screwed everything up! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Okay, let's watch the game.",193,8965
"02","14","Ted ","Barney, what the hell was that? We know who you bet on. Now you've ruined the game for everyone.",194,8966
"02","14","Lily ","Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.",195,8967
"02","14","Robin ","Way to blow it.",196,8968
"02","14","Marshall ","Yeah, I didn't know and now I do know.",197,8969
"02","14","Ted ","There's no point in even watching the game.",198,8970
"02","14","Lily ","Well, at least the commercials aren't ruined.",199,8971
"02","14","Marshall ","Wings are still good.",200,8972

"02","14","Robin ","I almost got fired today.",204,8976
"02","14","Barney ","I met Emmitt Smith today.",205,8977
"02","14","Lily ","Ooh, you go first.",206,8978
"02","14","Ted ","I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000.",207,8979
"02","14","Lily ","Yeah, go ahead, Barney.",208,8980
"02","14","Barney ","Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game...",209,8981
"02","14","Ted (voix off) ","And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that?",210,8982
"02","14","Barney ","I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss?",211,8983
"02","14","Ted ","50-50, give or take.",212,8984
"02","14","Barney ","Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks, whether or not there'd be a safety, first...",213,8985

"02","15","Robin ","That security guard was a little bit handsy.",2,8987
"02","15","Ted ","That's funny. She barely touched me. Uh, Gate 23. Come on. If we miss this flight, I will never forgive myself.",3,8988
"02","15","Ted (voix off) ","Why was this flight so important? Let's back up a few months to the fall of 2006. I had just sold my first building design and become the youngest project manager in my firm's history. Suddenly I was being headhunted. One firm was even considering me to run their entire New York office. They were flying me in for a final interview at their corporate headquarters in Chicago. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. It was my destiny. There was just one problem.",4,8989
"02","15","Ted ","Hi, wait, two more.",5,8990
"02","15","Woman ","Sorry, you're too late, I already shut the doors.",6,8991
"02","15","Ted ","Well, I'm sure if we pull real hard we can open them.",7,8992
"02","15","Woman ","Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but see, once I close those doors, that's it. Nobody else is allowed down that jet-way. Except for that guy.",8,8993
"02","15","Ted ","Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss the chance to interview for my dream job.",9,8994
"02","15","Woman ","I'm sorry, sir.",10,8995
"02","15","Robin ","His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job? Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do? I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night dreaming about being a... I mean, uh... This is a cool job.",11,8996
"02","15","Ted ","Please, I have to be on this flight.",12,8997
"02","15","Woman ","I'll see what I can do. But it doesn't look good.",13,8998
"02","15","Ted ","Thanks.",14,8999
"02","15","Robin ","Your uniforms are pretty.",15,9000
"02","15","Woman ","Okay. They haven't armed the doors yet, so you still have a chance. It's up to the captain now and they're calling us back.",16,9001
"02","15","Ted ","Great, please let us know as soon as you hear anything.",17,9002
"02","15","Woman ","Sure, and for the future, we recommend you arrive at the airport an hour and a half before your flight, not, you know, one minute after.",18,9003
"02","15","Ted ","Normally, I'm incredibly responsible. I just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced. Not that I'm a criminal or anything.",19,9004
"02","15","Rubin ","Yeah, he just jumped a subway turnstile.",20,9005
"02","15","Woman ","You seem to have a lot of problems with the rules of travel. (The phone rings) Hello? Oh, that is great news. It's my mom-- she found her missing earring. Have a seat. I'll call you when I hear something. Where was it?",21,9006
"02","15","Ted ","That thing better have call waiting.",22,9007
"02","15","Robin ","Could you just call the firm and explain what happened?",23,9008
"02","15","Ted ","It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today. I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage. I'm so stupid. Why did I have to jump that turnstile?",24,9009
"02","15","Robin ","Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault?",25,9010
"02","15","Ted (voix off) ","She had a point. It was kind of Barney's fault. Let's back up a few months.",26,9011
"02","15","Robin ","Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe?",27,9012
"02","15","Marshall ","Oh, man, it kills.",28,9013
"02","15","Lily ","You want some aspirin, baby?",29,9014
"02","15","Marshall ","You know I don't believe in pain killers.",30,9015
"02","15","Ted ","Wow, your first broken bone. Kind of kills your whole ""Unbreakable"" theory.",31,9016
"02","15","Lily ","Marshall used to think he was indestructible.",32,9017
"02","15","Marshall ","Well, it added up. I've never broken anything. I've never been sick, and when I need to, I can summon incredible strength. Ted, tell her the story of the really heavy door.",33,9018
"02","15","Ted ","There was a really heavy door. He opened it.",34,9019
"02","15","Marshall ","On one pull.",35,9020
"02","15","Robin ","Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow.",36,9021
"02","15","Marshall ","Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste.",37,9022
"02","15","Barney ","Training for a marathon.",38,9023
"02","15","Marshall ","What?",39,9024
"02","15","Barney ","You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.",40,9025
"02","15","Marshall ","You're kidding, right?",41,9026
"02","15","Barney ","Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.",42,9027
"02","15","Marshall ","So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?",43,9028
"02","15","Barney ","Absolutely.",44,9029
"02","15","Robin ","Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers.",45,9030
"02","15","Ted ","Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles.",46,9031
"02","15","Barney ","Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two.",47,9032
"02","15",NA,"Marshall:",48,9033
"02","15","Barney ","50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it $10,000.",49,9034
"02","15","Marshall ","You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.",50,9035
"02","15","Barney ","Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50.",51,9036
"02","15","Ted (voix off) ","The next morning, as the marathon began, we were focused on Marshall's computer.",52,9037
"02","15","Marshall ","Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online, see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe.",53,9038
"02","15","Robin ","Ooh, he's starting!",54,9039
"02","15","Marshall ","This ought to be good. Wow. (48 minutes later) He's already passing the second checkpoint.",55,9040
"02","15","Lily ","This tracking thing is amazing. When we get married, you're getting one of these.",56,9041
"02","15","Robin ","Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive.",57,9042
"02","15","Marshall ","He's gotta be cheating, okay. He knew we'd check.",58,9043
"02","15","Ted ","Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet. Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang ""Hungry Like the Wolf,"" and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to?",59,9044
"02","15","Marshall ","Well, it looks like, ""Barney"" should be coming over the Queensboro Bridge and up First Avenue within the next hour or so. But... there is no way that that's really him.",60,9045
"02","15","Marshall ","It's really him.",61,9046
"02","15","Lily ","Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run!",62,9047
"02","15","Barney ","What up, non-finishers?",63,9048
"02","15","Ted ","Wow. Very impressive, Barney.",64,9049
"02","15","Barney ","Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won.",65,9050
"02","15","Lily ","I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.",66,9051
"02","15","Barney ","So where's my 50 bucks?",67,9052
"02","15","Marshall ","All right. I got to admit, you earned this.",68,9053
"02","15","Barney ","Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym.",69,9054
"02","15","Marshall ","Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today.",70,9055
"02","15","Barney ","Wow. You know I really should check out this ""subway."" Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.",71,9056
"02","15","Ted ","You're dating a girl from New Jersey?",72,9057
"02","15","Barney ","No.",73,9058
"02","15","Ted (voix off) ","So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon. But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call.",74,9059
"02","15","Ted ","Hello?",75,9060
"02","15","Barney ","Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway.",76,9061
"02","15","Ted ","What, what are you talking about?",77,9062
"02","15","Barney ","I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.",78,9063
"02","15","Barney ","Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean.",79,9064
"02","15","Voice ","86th street.",80,9065
"02","15","Barney ","My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.",81,9066
"02","15","Ted ","(to Marshall) Barney's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train.",82,9067
"02","15","Marshall ","Best 50 bucks I ever spent.",83,9068
"02","15","Barney ","Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?",84,9069
"02","15","Ted ","All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.",85,9070
"02","15","Barney ","Ted, Ted.",86,9071
"02","15","Woman ","Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?",87,9072
"02","15","Barney ","I'm sorry. I can't.",88,9073
"02","15","Old lady"," Douche.",89,9074
"02","15","Ted ","Barney?!",90,9075
"02","15","Barney ","Ted!",91,9076
"02","15","Policeman ","Hey!",92,9077
"02","15","Barney ","No...!",93,9078
"02","15","Robin ","See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight.",94,9079
"02","15","Ted ","You're right. Everything can be traced back to him. Like that rash we all got at Christmas. I have to see what's going on.",95,9080
"02","15","Woman ","So I was able to get you two seats.",96,9081
"02","15","Ted ","Really? That's great!",97,9082
"02","15","Woman ","No, no, not you. I'm talking to my mom about Blue Man Group. Ma, can I call you back?",98,9083
"02","15","Ted ","Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on?",99,9084
"02","15","Woman ","I'm still waiting for... Huh. Looks like your flight left already.",100,9085
"02","15","Ted ","What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today.",101,9086
"02","15","Robin ","Well, he never even called you back?",102,9087
"02","15","Woman ","Well, it's typical pilot.They don't call you back at work and they don't call you back after you spend two nights with them at a Radisson in Orlando.",103,9088
"02","15","Ted (voix off) ","It turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me to Chicago on time for my job interview, but it was all the way on the other side of the airport.",104,9089
"02","15","Robin ","What was the name of the airline again?",105,9090
"02","15","Ted ","I think it was something like Flights R' Us.",106,9091
"02","15","Robin ","Was the ""R"" backwards?",107,9092
"02","15","Ted ","God, I hope not.",108,9093
"02","15","Robin ","Geez.",109,9094
"02","15","Ted ","Stupid smart carts. More like dumb carts.",110,9095
"02","15","Robin ","If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault.",111,9096
"02","15","Ted ","You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.",112,9097
"02","15","Robin ","Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault?",113,9098
"02","15","Ted (voix off) ","For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April.",114,9099
"02","15","Marshall ","My pants are starting to feel a little tight.",115,9100
"02","15","Lily ","Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly.",116,9101
"02","15","Marshall ","I cannot allow this.",117,9102
"02","15","Lily ","What?",118,9103
"02","15","Marshall ","I am going to run the New York City Marathon.",119,9104
"02","15","Lily ","""It is important to load up on carbohydrates two to four hours before a big run. Try a breakfast of a bagel, a banana, oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice."" Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said.",120,9105
"02","15","Marshall ","Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style. Liquids are digested faster. That way, no energy is wasted, and it's all about the run.",121,9106
"02","15","Lily ","""Don't forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement.""",122,9107
"02","15","Marshall ","This is gonna be your best run yet. You're going to accomplish all of your goals. You are a robot sent from the future to win the marathon! You are... Marshall. You are... Marshall. You are Marshall! Yeah!",123,9108
"02","15","Lily ","""Chafing or blisters can occur in a number of areas, including the feet, armpits, or even the nipples. Try using some petroleum jelly on the affected areas.""",124,9109
"02","15","Marshall ","Oh, gosh! Dude, you are a terrific runner. Tomorrow you're gonna run and finish the New York City Marathon! You're the best. You look good. Nobody does it better than you.",125,9110
"02","15","Robin ","Marshall? Oh, my God!",126,9111
"02","15","Ted ","So, yes, it was your fault. I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time! (Ted fells) And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport.",127,9112
"02","15","Robin ","That really wasn't my fault. I wouldn't have walked in on",128,9113
"02","15","Robin ","Hey, what's going on here?",129,9114
"02","15","Ted ","Oh, looks like they're camping out for something.",130,9115
"02","15","Robin ","Yeah, but for what?",131,9116
"02","15","Ted ","I don't know. Usually there's a Stormtrooper or Klingon in line to give you some indication. ""Annual wedding dress blowout. Designer sample dresses up to 90% off. Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m.""",132,9117
"02","15","Robin ","Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks?",133,9118
"02","15","Lily ","We have to camp out.",134,9119
"02","15","Robin ","Are you serious?",135,9120
"02","15","Lily ","You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun.",136,9121
"02","15","Barney "," I can't go. I've got this thing.",137,9122
"02","15","Lily ","What thing?",138,9123
"02","15","Barney ","A pen1s.",139,9124
"02","15","Robin ","This is the place.",140,9125
"02","15","Lily ","Oh, wow. Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet! Vera Wang! Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here?",141,9126
"02","15","Robin ","You said wang.",142,9127
"02","15","Lily ","Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998. Only fewer mullets.",143,9128
"02","15","Robin ","You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York.",144,9129
"02","15","Lily ","Ooh, this is comfy. We might actually be able to sleep.",145,9130
"02","15","Robin ","That's kind of annoying.",146,9131
"02","15","Lily ","Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute. (5 hours later) I don't think I can take this. Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again, but then it does. Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on?",147,9132
"02","15","Robin ","It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along?",148,9133
"02","15","Lily ","If we get through this, I swear I'm gonna live my life differently.",149,9134
"02","15","Robin ","I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time.",150,9135
"02","15","Man ","Morning, ladies.",151,9136
"02","15","Lily ","It's him. It's the car guy!",152,9137
"02","15","Robin ","Get out of here!",153,9138
"02","15","Ted (voix off) ","The next morning, Robin was too tired to go all the way back to Brooklyn, so while I was at work, she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours, and that's when...",154,9139
"02","15","Marshall ","Nobody does it better than you.",155,9140
"02","15","Robin ","Marshall?! Oh, my God! (Marshall falls)",156,9141
"02","15","Robin ","So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store, we would have made the first flight.",157,9142
"02","15","Ted ","Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it. Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight.",158,9143
"02","15","Man ","Oh, my God! You're that reporter from Metro News 1.",159,9144
"02","15","Robin ","Yes, yes, I am. I can't believe you recognized me.",160,9145
"02","15","Man ","You did that story on the giant pizzas?",161,9146
"02","15","Ted ","Would you check to see if you have any more seats?",162,9147
"02","15","Man ","One moment, sir. Were those pizzas real? Come on, were they?",163,9148
"02","15","Ted ","Robin...",164,9149
"02","15","Robin "," One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,",165,9150
"02","15","Man "," I knew it!",166,9151
"02","15","Robin ","God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight.",167,9152
"02","15","Man ","Well, the, uh, flight attendants are just finishing up their final seat count. Let me see what I can find out.",168,9153
"02","15","Ted ","Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny?",169,9154
"02","15","Man ","I think it might hurt. This is such a nightmare.",170,9155
"02","15","Robin ","Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out for a wedding dress?",171,9156
"02","15","Ted ","No. Wait. It goes back further. Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side?",172,9157
"02","15","Ted ","1939?! This penny's from 1939! (at the bar with Robin) A 67-year-old penny. Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II?",173,9158
"02","15","Robin ","Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting.",174,9159
"02","15","Ted ","Look, I know a little something about coins, and this baby is worth something to a collector.",175,9160
"02","15","Robin ","No, it's not.",176,9161
"02","15","Ted ","Yes, it is! You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner with the money I get for this little guy.",177,9162
"02","15",NA,"Ted( voix off): And that's exactly what I did.",178,9163
"02","15","Robin ","You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty.",179,9164
"02","15","Ted ","Hey, that's 150 times its original value. Actually, the meal was only $1.49. 1984.",180,9165
"02","15","Robin ","Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again.",181,9166
"02","15","Ted ","How dare you.",182,9167
"02","15","Robin ","Hey, what's going on?",183,9168
"02","15","Ted ","I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something.",184,9169
"02","15","Robin ","Yeah, but for what?",185,9170
"02","15","Ted ","It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town.",186,9171
"02","15","Robin ","And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there, and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day.",187,9172
"02","15","Ted ","Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe. Barney wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date...",188,9173
"02","15","Robin ","And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny.",189,9174
"02","15","Ted ","I wish I did. Though that person's already been punished enough, losing a sweet penny like that.",190,9175
"02","15","Man ","Uh, sir?",191,9176
"02","15","Ted ","Oh, please tell me you have some good news.",192,9177
"02","15","Man ","Uh, I'm afraid not. There are no extra seats on the plane. I'm sorry.",193,9178
"02","15","Robin ","All, right, well, thanks for trying.",194,9179
"02","15","Ted ","I can't believe this. That's it, it's over.",195,9180
"02","15","Robin ","Ted, come on. Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today. Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule.",196,9181
"02","15","Ted (voix off) ","But that's not what happened. They didn't reschedule. They hired someone else. And as it turned out, three months later, that guy ended up having to relocate to Chicago. Kids, funny thing about destiny, I thought I was destined to get that job. But I was wrong. My destiny was to stay in New York. Because if I hadn't, I never would have met your mother.",197,9182
"02","16","Ted (voix off) ","Kids, the key to a good relationship is communication. You need to talk.",1,9183
"02","16","Robin ","How about Mimi's?",2,9184
"02","16","Ted ","Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's.",3,9185
"02","16","Robin ","Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go.",4,9186
"02","16","Ted ","Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's. You love that place, remember what a great time we had the last time we were there?",5,9187
"02","16","Robin ","We did?",6,9188
"02","16","Ted ","Yeah, yeah. We had that crazy waiter who kept going, ""You two should get married! You two should get married!""",7,9189
"02","16","Ted (voix off) ","It's also important to know when to stop talking.",8,9190
"02","16","Ted ","Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining. It was so romantic? How can you not remember this?",9,9191
"02","16","Robin ","Because it wasn't me.",10,9192
"02","16","Ted ","Oh, right! It was... my sister.",11,9193
"02","16","Ted (voix off) ","You see, by the time you've hit your late 20s, you've dated a few people, but when you're in a relationship, it's common courtesy to pretend that you haven't.",12,9194
"02","16","Ted ","Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on. Remember when we went to see it? We sat in the back row.",13,9195
"02","16","Robin ","I've never seen Van Helsing.",14,9196
"02","16","Ted "," That's right. I saw it with my sister.",15,9197
"02","16","Robin ","My boss just got back from Maui. He said it was really romantic.",16,9198
"02","16","Ted ","Oh, it's so romantic.",17,9199
"02","16","Robin ","When were you in Maui?",18,9200
"02","16","Ted ","I... went... with my sister.",19,9201
"02","16","Robin ","With my sister. Why do you always say that? Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people. It's silly to try to act like we didn't.",20,9202
"02","16","Ted ","You're right. We should just be honest.",21,9203
"02","16","Robin ","Totally.",22,9204
"02","16","Ted ","See that girl over there? Three years ago, I totally made out with her.",23,9205
"02","16","Robin ","I don't want to hear that.",24,9206
"02","16","Ted ","What? You said...",25,9207
"02","16","Robin ","God, that is so insensitive.",26,9208
"02","16","Ted ","Remember honesty...?",27,9209
"02","16","Robin ","You're a jerk!",28,9210
"02","16","Ted ","Well, you're...confusing.",29,9211
"02","16","Marshall ","Okay, so you have to have s*x with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go!",30,9212
"02","16","Barney ","I don't know. Is she fat?",31,9213
"02","16","Marshall ","Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat.",32,9214
"02","16","Lily ","Hot off the presses!",33,9215
"02","16","Barney ","I-I don't take flyers.",34,9216
"02","16","Marshall ","You took one two seconds before you walked in here.",35,9217
"02","16","Barney ","That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?",36,9218
"02","16","Lily ","Fine. It's a flyer from my play.",37,9219
"02","16","Barney ","Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid...",38,9220
"02","16","Marshall ","Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good.",39,9221
"02","16","Barney ","Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this. Asking someone to come see your play is like asking someone for a ride to the airport or to crash on your couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers and repeat after me: Friends don't let friends come see their crappy play.",40,9222
"02","16","Ted ","Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us.",41,9223
"02","16","Barney ","Yes, you should break up.",42,9224
"02","16","Ted ","So, earlier tonight...",43,9225
"02","16","Robin ","Mm, we should get down to the bar.",44,9226
"02","16","Ted ","I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt.",45,9227
"02","16","Barney ","Oh, God, why is this part of the story?",46,9228
"02","16","Ted ","We're getting to it.",47,9229
"02","16","Robin ","Damn, my face is so dry. Is there any moisturizer around here?",48,9230
"02","16","Ted ","Yeah, there's some in the bathroom. Got to moisturize! Got to keep that pretty face moist.",49,9231
"02","16","Lily ","Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!",50,9232
"02","16","Barney ","What's wrong with her?",51,9233
"02","16","Marshall ","She hates that word.",52,9234
"02","16","Barney ","What word, ""moist""?",53,9235
"02","16","Lily ","No! Seriously, stop!",54,9236
"02","16","Robin ","So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist... face lotion...",55,9237
"02","16","Robin ","Wow, this is great stuff. Now I know the secret to your great complexion.",56,9238
"02","16","Ted ","What are you talking about? It's yours.",57,9239
"02","16","Robin ","No, it's not.",58,9240
"02","16","Ted ","Oh, well... then I guess it's Lily's.",59,9241
"02","16","Lily ","No, it's not.",60,9242
"02","16","Robin ","Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?",61,9243
"02","16","Ted ","Um, my sister's.",62,9244
"02","16","Robin ","So, in other words, some girl you went out with.",63,9245
"02","16","Ted ","Um... I love you.",64,9246
"02","16","Robin ","Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?",65,9247
"02","16","Lily ","It was probably Carla's. Her face was a train wreck.",66,9248
"02","16","Marshall ","I'm don't think Ted was dating her for her face.",67,9249
"02","16","Ted ","Thank you, Marshall. Thank you so much.",68,9250
"02","16","Robin ","Why is that still in your apartment?",69,9251
"02","16","Ted ","I don't know. I just never threw it out.",70,9252
"02","16","Robin ","Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl?",71,9253
"02","16","Ted ","Yeah. I'm madly in love with her, and the only way I can deal with it is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion.",72,9254
"02","16","Robin ","Not three dollars! Try 14.",73,9255
"02","16","Ted ","Why is this such a big deal?",74,9256
"02","16","Robin ","Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer!",75,9257
"02","16","Ted ","Whoa, she wasn't a whore.",76,9258
"02","16","Robin ","Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town. It sounds like a whore to me. What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around?",77,9259
"02","16","Ted ","Nothing. That's it. Well, except for the phone booth. And the lamp by the desk... and the...",78,9260
"02","16","Robin ","No. No! No! Oh, Ted!",79,9261
"02","16","Lily ","Ah, the age-old question: after you break up with someone, what do you do with the stuff?",80,9262
"02","16","Robin ","Question? Ain't no question, girl. Obviously, he's got to get rid of it.",81,9263
"02","16","Ted ","Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it.",82,9264
"02","16","Robin ","So we agreed that we would let you guys decide.",83,9265
"02","16","Ted ","Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants.",84,9266
"02","16","Barney ","Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.",85,9267
"02","16","Marshall ","Nice, right?",86,9268
"02","16","Robin ","I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old",87,9269
"02","16","Lily ","Yes!",88,9270
"02","16","Barney ","I vote they can stay. ""Check out the jackass in the parachute pants"" is a good icebreaker.",89,9271
"02","16","Marshall ","Ted. Ted? Ted?",90,9272
"02","16","Ted ","Sorry, buddy, it's a ""no"" for me, too. Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called. Even they don't want those pants back.",91,9273
"02","16","Marshall ","They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside.",92,9274
"02","16","Barney ","Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots.",93,9275
"02","16","Lily ","All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first.",94,9276
"02","16","Ted ","Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal. I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano, I don't think of Jeannie Radford, I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe. And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses. I remember when I was broke, just out of college, and I really needed a lamp. And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein. I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there.",95,9277
"02","16","Marshall ","Creamsicle and turkey gravy, not at the same time.",96,9278
"02","16","Robin ","Well, that's adorable, but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see.",97,9279
"02","16","Ex-girlfriend 1"," I'm Ted's college girlfriend. He made me 12 mix tapes. How many has he made you?",98,9280
"02","16","Ex-girlfriend 2"," He calls you ""sweetie pie""? He called me ""sweetie pie.""",99,9281
"02","16","Ex-girlfriend 3"," I'm stupid, but my rack is bigger than yours.",100,9282
"02","16","Ted ","Really? You can't look at a pillow without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow!",101,9283
"02","16","Robin ","Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross.",102,9284
"02","16","Ted ","You're creepy and gross.",103,9285
"02","16","Robin ","Your mom's creepy and gross.",104,9286
"02","16","Lily ","Order! Order! I got to side with Robin. She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff upsets her, you got to get rid of it.",105,9287
"02","16","Marshall ","I've got to side with Ted. Just 'cause you still have something an ex girlfriend gave you doesn't mean you're holding onto her.",106,9288
"02","16","Ted ","All right, Barney. It all comes down to you.",107,9289
"02","16","Barney ","I side with Robin.",108,9290
"02","16","Ted ","What?",109,9291
"02","16","Barney ","Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.",110,9292
"02","16","Robin ","Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?",111,9293
"02","16","Ted ","Just stop, sweetie.",112,9294
"02","16","Ted (voix off) ","So I had no choice. I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends. It was painful, but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night. New York is famous for its theater, but there's many different levels. There's Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, homeless people screaming in the park, and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in.",113,9295
"02","16","Robin ","Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?",114,9296
"02","16","Barney ","From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory.",115,9297
"02","16","Ted ","Where do you guys want to sit?",116,9298
"02","16","Barney ","I know where I don't want to sit.",117,9299
"02","16","Marshall (in the front row) ","Guys, four together!",118,9300
"02","16","Barney ","I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.",119,9301
"02","16","Robin ","Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.",120,9302
"02","16","Barney ","No? Okay.",121,9303
"02","16","Man 1"," I... am... Rage!",122,9304
"02","16","Woman ","I... am Greed.",123,9305
"02","16","Lily ","I am Rage... Envy!",124,9306
"02","16","Barney ","I am outta here.",125,9307
"02","16","Marshall ","No, you're not. You have to stay.",126,9308
"02","16","Lily ","This is the face of Consumerism!",127,9309
"02","16","Marshall ","Oh, my God. Ted's part of the play.",128,9310
"02","16","Man 2"," Hello, Greed, Rage...Envy... and Consumerism. I... am your father... America!",129,9311
"02","16","Marshall ","Oh, baby, that was wonderful!",130,9312
"02","16","Ted ","Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer.",131,9313
"02","16","Robin ","And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, ""Now we are really cookin'!""",132,9314
"02","16","Barney ","Wow, Lily, that sucked!",133,9315
"02","16","Marshall ","Barney!",134,9316
"02","16","Barney ","What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends.",135,9317
"02","16","Lily ","No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about.",136,9318
"02","16","Barney ","Yeah, if you're a Smurf.",137,9319
"02","16","Lily ","You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards.",138,9320
"02","16","Barney ","Oh, really? You would?",139,9321
"02","16","Lily ","Yes.",140,9322
"02","16","Barney ","Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.",141,9323
"02","16","Man ","We'll be starting our Q&A with the director-- yours truly-- in five minutes right here. Barney runs out",142,9324
"02","16","Robin ","Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play?",143,9325
"02","16","Ted ","I know. He can be really insensitive.",144,9326
"02","16","Robin ","It was pretty bad, though.",145,9327
"02","16","Ted ","Oh, my God, it was so bad.",146,9328
"02","16","Robin ","Oh, my God, you've been robbed!",147,9329
"02","16","Ted ","Nope.",148,9330
"02","16","Robin ","All that stuff was from old girlfriends? Don't you buy anything for yourself?",149,9331
"02","16","Ted ","What can I say? Papa gets swag.",150,9332
"02","16","Ted (voix off) ","And that should've been the end of it. But the next day...",151,9333
"02","16","Ted ","You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff. But seeing how happy it makes you - totally worth it.",152,9334
"02","16","Robin ","Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have s*x with you when I'm really tired.",153,9335
"02","16","Ted ","Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Well, sit. Sit, yeah. So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?",154,9336
"02","16","Robin ","Nope. Well, except for my dogs.",155,9337
"02","16","Ted ","So I had to get rid of everything from my past relationships because you don't keep things from your past relationships except, uh, where are your five dogs from? Oh, that's right: your past relationships.",156,9338
"02","16","Robin ","What's your point, Ted?",157,9339
"02","16","Ted ","Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment, and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends?",158,9340
"02","16","Robin ","What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends?",159,9341
"02","16","Ted ","I do now.",160,9342
"02","16","Robin ","That's ridiculous.",161,9343
"02","16","Ted ","I thought you said you got rid of everything your ex-boyfriends gave you. Well, yeah, but not my dogs.",162,9344
"02","16","Ted ","You said everything.",163,9345
"02","16","Robin ","But not living things.",164,9346
"02","16","Ted ","Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away.",165,9347
"02","16","Robin ","Things with a heartbeat can stay.",166,9348
"02","16","Ted ","Enjoying this?",167,9349
"02","16","Robin ","Pickles, go get your ball. Go get your ball.",168,9350
"02","16","Ted ","Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you to make me get rid of all my stuff.",169,9351
"02","16","Robin ","Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs?",170,9352
"02","16","Man ","Guess what position we did it in.",171,9353
"02","16","Ted ","Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs.",172,9354
"02","16","Robin ","Um, no.",173,9355
"02","16","Ted ","Really? Well, I say we take it to the group, but I don't like your chances.",174,9356
"02","16","Marshall ","She's not getting rid of the dogs.",175,9357
"02","16","Lily ","What's the matter with you?",176,9358
"02","16","Barney ","Even I wouldn't do that.",177,9359
"02","16","Robin ","Yes!",178,9360
"02","16","Lily ","You can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair, but not their dog.",179,9361
"02","16","Marshall ","I miss Jebediah.",180,9362
"02","16","Barney ","Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play.",181,9363
"02","16","Lily ","Very funny.",182,9364
"02","16","Barney ","Oh, it's not a joke. It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night. And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long, I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends.",183,9365
"02","16","Lily ","Oh, we'll be there.",184,9366
"02","16","Barney ","Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong...",185,9367
"02","16","Lily ","Never.",186,9368
"02","16","Barney ","Good. Okay, I gotta go rehearse. Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho; the first three rows get wet.",187,9369
"02","16","Robin ","I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from.",188,9370
"02","16","Ted ","I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them. That was ridiculous.",189,9371
"02","16","Robin ","So we're-we're okay?",190,9372
"02","16","Ted ","Yeah, we're great.",191,9373
"02","16","Ted (voix off) ","And I thought we were, but just as it did in the seventh act of Aunt Lily's play, Jealousy reared its ugly head.",192,9374
"02","16","Man ","Oh, yeah, that's the spot.",193,9375
"02","16","Man ","Dude, I gotta pee.",194,9376
"02","16","Ted ","I gotta go.",195,9377
"02","16","Lily ","Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh?",196,9378
"02","16","Robin ","Yeah, he really is. It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs. Might be time to send them to the farm.",197,9379
"02","16","Lily ","You're gonna k*ll your dogs?!",198,9380
"02","16","Robin ","No! No, no, no, there really is a farm. My aunt has a farm upstate.",199,9381
"02","16","Lily ","Oh, thank God. Aw, you know, if I were five dogs, I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn.",200,9382
"02","16","Robin ","Yeah. I could visit them on weekends. My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty.",201,9383
"02","16","Lily ","Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs.",202,9384
"02","16","Robin ","""They""? What do you mean by ""they""?",203,9385
"02","16","Lily ","Uh... uh.... uh... People upstate. Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!",204,9386
"02","16","Marshall ","Are you sure you're gonna be okay? I mean, you know that this is gonna be...",205,9387
"02","16","Lily ","I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do.",206,9388
"02","16","Barney ","Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.",207,9389
"02","16","Ted (voix off) ","That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.",208,9390
"02","16","Barney ","Moist.",209,9391
"02","16","Ted (voix off) ","And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.",210,9392
"02","16","Barney ","I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over.",211,9393
"02","16","Marshall ","I never get picked for audience participation.",212,9394
"02","16","Ted (voix off) ","And then it just got weird.",213,9395
"02","16","Barney ","Feelings. Inside. Oh, no!",214,9396
"02","16","Ted (voix off) ","And when that didn't work...",215,9397
"02","16","Lily ","Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show.",216,9398
"02","16","Barney ","Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?",217,9399
"02","16","Lily ","No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar.",218,9400
"02","16","Barney ","Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting",219,9401
"02","16","Lily ","Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go.",220,9402
"02","16","Barney ","Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.",221,9403
"02","16","Lily ","Yeah, well, anyway.",222,9404
"02","16","Barney ","Act two is where I really hit my stride. Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love. Lily: How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show?",223,9405
"02","16","Barney ","It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two.",224,9406
"02","16","Ted (voix off) ","So we stayed and let Barney torture us for another hour and a half, 'cause that's what friends do, apparently.",225,9407
"02","16","Robin ","Hey.",226,9408
"02","16","Ted ","Where've you been? I called you earlier.",227,9409
"02","16","Robin ","I gave my dogs away to my aunt.",228,9410
"02","16","Ted ","You what?",229,9411
"02","16","Robin ","Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but... I think it's for the best.",230,9412
"02","16","Ted ","Wow. Oh, man.",231,9413
"02","16","Robin ","Can we go inside?",232,9414
"02","16","Ted ","Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar.",233,9415
"02","16","Robin ","Why? What's going on inside?",234,9416
"02","16","Ted ","Um, the floors are gone.",235,9417
"02","16","Robin ","What?",236,9418
"02","16","Ted ","Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed. This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail.",237,9419
"02","16","Ted ","I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!",238,9420
"02","16","Robin ","You said you threw all that stuff away!",239,9421
"02","16","Ted (voix off) ","Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had. It was one of those fights that last for hours and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about. We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window. Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy. But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me, but somehow we got to here.",240,9422
"02","16","Robin ","We're really doing this?",241,9423
"02","16","Ted ","Yeah.",242,9424
"02","16","Ted and Robin"," We're moving in together!",243,9425
"02","16","Barney ","The robot found love Confusing my circuitry My software's been hacked Toaster oven You're the one for me Two, three, four.",244,9426
"02","16","Marshall ","That's two.",245,9427
"02","17","Ted ","This is awesome.",1,9428
"02","17","Marshall ","I can't believe this moment's finally here. One more mile and my little boy turns 200,000.",2,9429
"02","17","Ted ","Your baby Fiero's grown into a really old man Fiero. And just like an old man, he leaks fluid, smells stale, makes weird noises out the back.",3,9430
"02","17","Marshall ","Yeah, he does. Hey, light up those cigars in the glove compartment. They're real Cubans. I got 'em in Chinatown last year just for this moment.",4,9431
"02","17","Ted ","Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off, but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins.",5,9432
"02","17","Marshal ","What are you talking about?",6,9433
"02","17","Ted ","Whoa, pothole. The car stops.",7,9434
"02","17","Marshall ","What? No. Oh. No. No, no, no. No, there's only.8 miles to go. Come on, buddy. Buddy!",8,9435
"02","17","Ted ","Is it cool if I still light these?",9,9436
"02","17","Ted (voix off) ","Kids, sometimes life forces us to be someone we didn't want to be. When that happens, we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were. Maybe a tattoo. Or a piece of jewelry. A tiny souvenir that reminds us, ""This is who I really am."" Marshall's souvenir was not so tiny, but the more he found himself being pushed toward the corporate world and away from his dream of saving the environment, the tighter he held on to that Fiero.",10,9437
"02","17","Ted ","Hey. One good thing: we're off the hook for the folding party today.",11,9438
"02","17","Marshall ","Hey. It's very important to both Lily and me that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our wedding's... I couldn't even get through it. Thank God.",12,9439
"02","17","Ted ","Hey, your car's going to be fine. This is the best auto shop around. Look at this certificate. One of the mechanics here finished a 64-ounce steak.",13,9440
"02","17","Lily ","Surprise.",14,9441
"02","17","Robin ","We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here.",15,9442
"02","17","Barney ","We insisted.",16,9443
"02","17","Ted ","Terrific.",17,9444
"02","17","Barney ","How's the Fiero?",18,9445
"02","17","Marshall ","She's still in triage.",19,9446
"02","17","Ted ","She? I thought it was your little boy.",20,9447
"02","17","Lily ","Oh, it goes back and forth. It's sort of a tr*nny car.",21,9448
"02","17","Robin ","How long have you had her... slash him?",22,9449
"02","17","Marshall ","My brothers handed it down to me when I was 16.",23,9450
"02","17","Robin ","Oh, how nice of them.",24,9451
"02","17","Marshall ","Not really.",25,9452
"02","17","Brother 1"," Congratulations.",26,9453
"02","17","Brother 2"," The Fiero is yours. If you pass the final test.",27,9454
"02","17","Marshall ","Come on! I already shaved my legs and swallowed five dollars in quarters. Only $4.50 has come out.",28,9455
"02","17","Brother 1"," Just go to the Weinerburger drive-thru and get us 12 cups of coffee.",29,9456
"02","17","Marshall ","That's it?",30,9457
"02","17","Brother 2"," Oh, yeah. But we get to decide what you wear.",31,9458
"02","17","Marshall ","Agreed. Totally agreed.",32,9459
"02","17","Man ","You're naked.",33,9460
"02","17","Marshall ","I'm aware of that.",34,9461
"02","17","Man ","You have 50 cents?",35,9462
"02","17","Marshall ","No... Look, can I just have my coffee, please?",36,9463
"02","17","Man ","Sorry, we're all out of trays and lids. Two tall guys just came through here a few minutes ago and bought 'em all.",37,9464
"02","17","Ted ","And that is the origin of Marshall's insane ""no food or drinks in the Fiero, not even groceries"" rule.",38,9465
"02","17","Marshall ","It is not insane.",39,9466
"02","17","Lily ","Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.",40,9467
"02","17","Barney ","Well, I'm trying, but it's...",41,9468
"02","17","Lily ","Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?",42,9469
"02","17","Barney ","Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it.",43,9470
"02","17","Lily ","No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out.",44,9471
"02","17","Barney ","Aw, nerts.",45,9472
"02","17","Ted ","The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it. Remember the 100K fiasco?",46,9473
"02","17","Marshall ","Ah, the Fiero-asco.",47,9474
"02","17","Ted ","Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco.",48,9475
"02","17","Robin ","What's the 100K fiasco?",49,9476
"02","17","Marshall ","The Fiero-asco?",50,9477
"02","17","Ted ","It was just before winter break our freshman year of college. Marshall and I were roommates, but we weren't really good friends yet.",51,9478
"02","17","Marshall ","I thought Ted was a little bit pretentious.",52,9479
"02","17","Ted ","And Marshall was a total slob.",53,9480
"02","17","Marshall ","Hey (Marshall throws a sandwich in the trash but misses it) I'm driving my Fiero back over break. I know we see enough of each other as it is, but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money. You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up.",54,9481
"02","17","Ted ","All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio. I live in the moment. Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving. We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so...",55,9482
"02","17","Marshall ","All right, well, call me if you change your mind. My odometer's going to hit 100K.",56,9483
"02","17","Ted ","She'd be so bummed if I left early.",57,9484
"02","17","Ted ","It was totally mutual. I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I... it was... it was totally mutual.",58,9485
"02","17","Marshall ","I hear you.",59,9486
"02","17","Ted ","So what's up with you and Lily? Anything serious",60,9487
"02","17","Marshall ","Yeah. Dude, we're college freshmen. I'm not going to get tied down by the first chick I hook up with. Lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know?",61,9488
"02","17",NA,"Ted(voix off): The next few hours of our drive were classic road trip.",62,9489
"02","17","Ted ","So... this song.",63,9490

"02","20","Barney ","So which one, ""A"" or ""B""?",66,9716
"02","20","Marshall ","What was that?",67,9717
"02","20","Barney ","I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, ""Barney Stinson, come on down!""",68,9718
"02","20","Ted ","Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?",69,9719
"02","20","Barney ","Yeah, of course.",70,9720
"02","20","Barney ","Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.",71,9721
"02","20","Lily ","It's $300 just to take the bust in? Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me. I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress. I lost all this weight without even trying. Hello?",72,9722
"02","20","Robin ","What happened?",73,9723
"02","20","Lily ","She called me a bitch and hung up. Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just have to pay the $300.",74,9724
"02","20","Robin ","Pay the $300? Lily, are you crazy? This isn't a problem. It's a license to eat. Look, what have you always wanted to eat but didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?",75,9725

"02","20","Lily ","Done!",78,9728
"02","20","Ted ","Okay, think you're gonna be happy with my new toast. There's nothing sexual. It's, uh, it's just the story of an important moment in your relationship.",79,9729

"02","20","Ted ","I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.",81,9731
"02","20","Marshall ","Nice.",82,9732
"02","20","Ted ","Right? That's great. Back when we were all freshman and Marshall and Lily were just a few short weeks into their relationship... It was 4:00 in the morning, and I'm not gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted. We were starving. So I'd gone out to get us some snacks, and when I got back...",83,9733
"02","20","Marshall ","I love you.",84,9734

"02","20","Ted ","Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food?",88,9738
"02","20","Marshall ","Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's not important. Also, so Lily's never heard that story before. How's she going to react when she finds out the first time I said ""I love you"" to her, I was actually saying it to you and a bag of Funyuns",89,9739
"02","20","Ted ","But who cares? You did love her. And you still do. And you're totally over Funyuns, so it's not weird.",90,9740
"02","20","Marshall ","Hey, Lil.",91,9741
"02","20","Lily ","Hey.",92,9742
"02","20","Ted ","Hey? That's it?",93,9743
"02","20","Marshall ","What are you talking about?",94,9744
"02","20","Ted ","Well, you guys have been spending the last few nights apart. I figured there'd be a lot of giggling, crying, jumping up and down, and then whatever Lily would do",95,9745
"02","20",NA,"Ted (2030): Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.",96,9746
"02","20","Barney ","Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready? (he turnst he wheel)",97,9747
"02","20","Marshall ","Oh, wow, that was pretty close.",98,9748
"02","20","Barney ","Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined!",99,9749
"02","20","Ted ","What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?",100,9750
"02","20","Barney ","Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father.",101,9751

"02","20","Barney ","Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.",111,9761
"02","20","Barney ","Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?",112,9762

"02","20","Ted ","You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?",118,9768

"02","20","Robin ","Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there.",120,9770
"02","20","Lily ","This is the best wedding diet ever.",121,9771
"02","20","Lily ","I lost a pound.",122,9772

"02","20","Lily ","I knew that Super Size Me guy was full of it.",124,9774
"02","20","Robin ","Well, it must be the wedding stress. We just got to up the intake. Lily Aldrin, drop and give me 20 bites of fudge! Okay? Don't nibble at it. Attack it! Come on, Lily. You can do better than that!",125,9775

"02","20","Ted ","Great, yeah. I'd like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall",135,9785

"02","20","Ted ","Now, I wasn't supposed to hear this next part, but Marshall leaned over to Lily and whispered.",141,9791
"02","20","Marshall ","You know what I'd like to do to you right now? I'd like to hold your hand. I'd like to hold your hand so hard that you're not able to shake hands for a week.",142,9792

"02","20","Marshall ","That's the worst toast I've ever heard, dude. It's totally boring.",145,9795
"02","20","Ted ","Exactly. It's impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me, man. I give up. I'm just going to read that thing about Jesus and the footprints.",146,9796
"02","20","Lily ","I give up, too. I don't care if my dress doesn't fit. I can't eat anymore. I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode.",147,9797
"02","20","Marshall ","I know.",148,9798
"02","20","Ted ","And so, Lily and I were both about to give up, but as you can all see, Lily does look beautiful in that dress, and here I am giving a toast. You know, all this time, I'd been wracking my brain trying to pick out the perfect moment to capture Lily and Marshall as a couple. But then I realized the perfect moment wasn't some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together. The perfect Lily and Marshall moment happened two nights ago.",149,9799

"02","21","Lily ","Bill?",45,9931
"02","21","Barney ","Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar.",46,9932
"02","21","Bill ","Can I ask you something? Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects?",47,9933
"02","21","Barney ","Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.",48,9934
"02","21","Bill ","Oh, so when do you think someone should do it? Just wait for a lull or what?",49,9935
"02","21","Lily ","Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?",50,9936
"02","21","Barney ","He kind of did.",51,9937
"02","21","Lily ","That's Scooter.",52,9938
"02","21","Robin ","Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?",53,9939
"02","21","Lily ","His real name is Bill. My mom must have invited him.",54,9940
"02","21","Robin ","Why? Why would she do that?",55,9941
"02","21","Lily ","Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine.",56,9942
"02","21","Barney ","I'll get it.",57,9943
"02","21","Lily ","Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?",58,9944
"02","21","Barney ","He's great. He's about to get his hair cut.",59,9945
"02","21","Lily ","Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.",60,9946
"02","21","Barney ","Me, too. I was up all night.",61,9947
"02","21","Scooter ","Hello, Lily.",62,9948
"02","21","Barney ","Hey, Bill.",63,9949
"02","21","Scooter ","Hey, Barney.",64,9950
"02","21","Lily ","Scooter, what are you doing here?",65,9951
"02","21","Scooter ","It's not ""Scooter"" anymore. It's Bill. A lot of things have changed about me, Lily, but one hasn't. I still love you. And I came here to win you back.",66,9952
"02","21","Lily ","You're really cute. Oh, no. Really?",67,9953
"02","21","Lily ","I want... I want... Scooter!",68,9954
"02","21","Barney ","I need a glass of wine.",69,9955
"02","21","Barman ","And I need you to get out of my face.",70,9956
"02","21","Barney ","It's for the bride, so...",71,9957
"02","21","Barney ","White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda.",72,9958
"02","21","Barman ","You got it.",73,9959
"02","21","Barney ","She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds.",74,9960
"02","21","Barman ","I don't have any, but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some.",75,9961
"02","21","Barney ","Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin.",76,9962
"02","21","Barney ","Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.",77,9963
"02","21","Scooter ","Maybe my words won't change your mind, but maybe the words of a poet will. I read from ""November Rain."" By W. Axl Rose.",78,9964
"02","21","Robin ","That is a good song.",79,9965
"02","21","Brad ","Barney said you needed me to bounce some guy named Scooter?",80,9966
"02","21","Brad ","What's up with Bill?",81,9967
"02","21","Robin ","That's Scooter.",82,9968
"02","21","Brad ","I'm on it.",83,9969
"02","21","Barney ","Hey.",84,9970
"02","21","Woman ","Hey.",85,9971
"02","21","Barney ","Can I have your phone number?",86,9972
"02","21","Woman ","No.",87,9973
"02","21","Barney ","It's for the bride.",88,9974
"02","21","Woman ","Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen.",89,9975
"02","21","Barney ","The bride wants you to walk slower.",90,9976
"02","21","Robin ","Oh, wow.",91,9977
"02","21","Lily ","Oh. Robin... My makeup looks perfect right now, and I'm about to cry. Do something.",92,9978
"02","21","Robin ","I have hairy nipples.",93,9979
"02","21","Lily ","Really?",94,9980
"02","21","Robin ","No, but it worked, didn't it?",95,9981
"02","21","Brad ","Hey. Funny story. I tackled this guy I thought was Scooter. Turns out it was your photographer. Don't worry. I got this sweet camera phone, so we're covered.",96,9982
"02","21","Robin ","There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call...",97,9983
"02","21","Lily ","Robin, stop. Stop. It's okay. I am not gonna let anything get to me today.",98,9984
"02","21","Woman ","I just got a call from the florist. The flowers won't be here till halfway through the ceremony.",99,9985
"02","21","Lily ","I'm okay.",100,9986
"02","21","Man ","I hate to bother you, but... I think I found your veil in the parking lot.",101,9987
"02","21","Lily ","I'm fine.",102,9988
"02","21","Andrea ","Just FYI: my water broke. But I can probably......make it through.",103,9989
"02","21","Lily ","Totally cool.",104,9990
"02","21","Robin ","Oh, no. Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry.",105,9991
"02","21","Lily ","Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on.",106,9992
"02","21","Robin ","Are you sure?",107,9993
"02","21","Lily ","I'm marrying Marshall today. So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil in a room that has no flowers to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning, as my high school boyfriend reads g*ns N' Roses lyrics. But that's okay, because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway.",108,9994
"02","21","Robin ","Lily, are you okay?",109,9995
"02","21","Lily ","What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay! Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has! It's ruined!",110,9996
"02","21","Robin ","What happened to ""I don't want a perfect wedding""?",111,9997
"02","21","Lily ","Oh, grow up, Robin! Of course I want a perfect wedding! Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but... I do. I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today.",112,9998
"02","21","Robin ","And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better.",113,9999
"02","21","Lily ","What could you have that could possibly make me feel better? God, I hope Marshall's having a better day than I'm having.",114,10000
"02","21","Marshall ","Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!",115,10001
"02","21","Ted ","What?",116,10002
"02","21","Barney ","Well, it's not too short.",117,10003
"02","21","Marshall ","My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!",118,10004
"02","21","Barney ","You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.",119,10005
"02","21","Ted ","The good Backstreet Boys?",120,10006
"02","21","Marshall ","Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?!",121,10007
"02","21","Ted ","What-what the hell happened to you?",122,10008
"02","21","Marshall ","Lily's cousin is in beauty school, and Lily didn't want her to do her hair, so she said she could do mine.",123,10009
"02","21","Marshall ","So, um, just not-not too short, okay?",124,10010
"02","21","Cousin ","Oh, no, we don't even have to cut it at all. Could just give it some style.",125,10011
"02","21","Marshall ","Oh, okay, yeah, that's great. 'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird. And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know.",126,10012
"02","21","Cousin ","Ooh, I could give you some cool guy tips.",127,10013
"02","21","Marshall ","I don't think I need advice on how to be cool, but yeah, great, lay that on me.",128,10014
"02","21","Marshall ","I can't get married like this! There's no way!",129,10015
"02","21","Barney ","Ah, let me see what I can do.",130,10016
"02","21","Ted ","What? What can you do?",131,10017
"02","21","Barney ","I have a superpower.",132,10018
"02","21","Marshall ","Lily is gonna k*ll me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this.",133,10019
"02","21","Ted ","That's crazy. Of course she will.",134,10020
"02","21","Marshall ","Would you marry me?",135,10021
"02","21","Ted ","No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule: never marry anyone you've had a farting contest with.",136,10022
"02","21","Marshall ","Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?",137,10023
"02","21","Barney ","Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?",138,10024
"02","21","Ted ","Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution.",139,10025
"02","21","Marshall ","Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?!",140,10026
"02","21","Ted ","What?!",141,10027
"02","21","Marshall ","You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo.",142,10028
"02","21","Ted ","Dude, those guys are criminals.",143,10029
"02","21","Marshall ","Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something!",144,10030
"02","21","Ted ","Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these.",145,10031
"02","21","Marshall ","No!",146,10032
"02","21","Ted ","Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?",147,10033
"02","21","Ben ","Yes.",148,10034
"02","21","Ted ","Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out.",149,10035
"02","21","Ben ","Yeah.",150,10036
"02","21","Ted ","Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head.",151,10037
"02","21","Ben ","Oh, no!",152,10038
"02","21","Ted ","Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area?",153,10039
"02","21","Ben ","Yeah, that would probably work, but with what? That's a tough one.",154,10040
"02","21","Ted ","Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches",155,10041
"02","21","Ben ","Mm, yeah. Does anyone here wear a toupee? (Ben's wearing a toupee) Shouldn't be hard to find out. Most of them are pretty bad.",156,10042
"02","21","Ted ","That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair.",157,10043
"02","21","Ben ","Boy, that's a pretty tall order.",158,10044
"02","21","Ted ","Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?",159,10045
"02","21","Ben ","No, not off the top of my... No. Can't.",160,10046
"02","21","Ted ","Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee.",161,10047
"02","21","Barney ","The bride needs this.",162,10048
"02","21","Marshall ","Actually, I think it kinda works.",163,10049
"02","21","Ted ","It totally does.",164,10050
"02","21","Marshall ","Barney?",165,10051
"02","21","Barney ","To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it.",166,10052
"02","21","Marshall ","Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it?",167,10053
"02","21","Ted ","It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.",168,10054
"02","21","Marshall ","Oh, you know...",169,10055
"02","21","Ted ","In a bad way.",170,10056
"02","21","Brad ","Hey. Cool hair, bro.",171,10057
"02","21","Ted ","What happened to your shirt?",172,10058
"02","21","Brad ","I got sauce on it when I tackled the caterer.",173,10059
"02","21","Ted ","You gonna put another shirt on?",174,10060
"02","21","Brad ","No, I'm good. Hey, you guys seen Scooter?",175,10061
"02","21","Marshall ","What? What? Scooter's here? That guy's at my wedding?",176,10062
"02","21","Brad ","Not for long, bro. Not for long.",177,10063
"02","21","Marshall ","Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay?",178,10064
"02","21","Barney ","It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.",179,10065
"02","21","Ted ","Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress.",180,10066
"02","21","Marshall ","Oh, no.",181,10067
"02","21","Lily ","Oh, my God! Marshall...",182,10068
"02","21","Marshall ","Lily, you're not supposed to see me.",183,10069
"02","21","Robin ","Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you.",184,10070
"02","21","Lily ","What happened? Did Amy do this to you?",185,10071
"02","21","Marshall ","Just the frosted tips. I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby. I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I?",186,10072
"02","21","Lily ","Oh, no, you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie. It was already ruined. There's no flowers, no photographer. Oh, and Scooter's here, by the way.",187,10073
"02","21","Marshall ","Yeah, I know. I heard.",188,10074
"02","21","Lily ","My veil got thrashed, the harp player is in labor, and I'm not wearing my wedding underwear.",189,10075
"02","21","Marshall ","What? No ""Property of Marshall"" across the back? How are people going to know whose butt that is?",190,10076
"02","21","Lily ","What happened? Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony?",191,10077
"02","21","Marshall ","I wish we could have that wedding.",192,10078
"02","21","Ted ","So do it.",193,10079
"02","21","Marshall ","What?",194,10080
"02","21","Ted ","Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate.",195,10081
"02","21","Barney ","Yes. Yes, I can. Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something: your jaws-- because Barney Stinson is about to aid and abet a marriage.",196,10082
"02","21","Marshall ","Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there?",197,10083
"02","21","Robin ","Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here.",198,10084
"02","21","Marshall ","What do you think, baby?",199,10085
"02","21","Lily ","I love it.",200,10086
"02","21","Marshall ","Me, too. Let's do it. Let's get married before we get married.",201,10087
"02","21","Lily ","Great. Wait, hold on. Excuse me, sir. Could we borrow your hat?",202,10088
"02","21","Man ","Okay.",203,10089
"02","21","Lily ","Thank you.",204,10090
"02","21","Marshall ","Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat.",205,10091
"02","21","Barney ","Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other.",206,10092
"02","21","Robin ","He's gonna cry.",207,10093
"02","21","Barney ","No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?",208,10094
"02","21","Marshall ","Oh, no. I don't have my vows.",209,10095
"02","21","Lily ","I don't have mine either.",210,10096
"02","21","Ted ","You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other.",211,10097
"02","21","Marshall ","Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick. You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called ""Eggs Marshall,"" and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy.",212,10098
"02","21","Ted ","No problem.",213,10099
"02","21","Barney ","It's totally okay.",214,10100
"02","21","Lily ","My turn. Oh, thank you. Marshall, I love you because you're funny and you make me feel loved and you make me feel safe and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says, ""Lily and Marshall. Rockin' It Since '96."" I kinda wish I was wearing it right now 'cause it smells like you. But the main reason I love you, Marshall Ericksen, is you make me happy. You make me happy all the time.",215,10101
"02","21","Robin ","Hey, I found your panties!",216,10102
"02","21","Lily ","I'm good.",217,10103
"02","21","Barney ","Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward?",218,10104
"02","21","Lily ","Slow down.",219,10105
"02","21","Barney ","I can't From this day forward so as long as you both shall live?",220,10106
"02","21","Marshall ","I do.",221,10107
"02","21","Barney ","Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to be your husband to have and to hold... live?",222,10108
"02","21","Lily ","I do.",223,10109
"02","21","Barney ","Okay, then, by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.",224,10110
"02","21","Marshall ","Did you smoke?",225,10111
"02","21","Lily ","No.",226,10112
"02","21","Robin ","Wow. First lie of marriage. That was fast.",227,10113
"02","21",NA,"Ted (2030): After that, we all went back inside for the second wedding. And yes, a lot of things did go wrong, but it didn't matter because when I look back on that day, what I remember is the first wedding; the intimate outdoor ceremony with just close friends and an acoustic guitar.",228,10114
"02","21","Marshall ","How do you feel?",229,10115
"02","21","Lily ","Tired. I got married twice today.",230,10116
"02","21","Marshall ","So where do you want to do it for the first time as a married couple, nice hotel room or a reception hall bathroom?",231,10117
"02","21","Lily ","What do you think? Bathroom, of course.",232,10118
"02","21","Ted ","Please don't.",233,10119
"02","21","Marshall and Lily"," Sorry, Ted.",234,10120
"02","22","Man ","Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever Mr. and Marshall Eriksen and Lily Aldrin.",1,10121
"02","22","Lily ","Does it make you kind of sad that we don't share the same last name?",2,10122
"02","22","Marshall ","You know, in a totally evolved 21st-century kind of way yeah, a little.",3,10123
"02","22","Lily ","You know what we should do? We should come up with a whole new last name.",4,10124

"02","22","Robin ","Hi. Have you met Barney?",26,10146
"02","22","Barney ","Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what?",27,10147
"02","22","Ted ","Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?",28,10148

"02","22","Robin ","So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?",156,10276
"02","22","Ted ","Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina.",157,10277

"02","22","Robin ","You know what I mean.",173,10293
"02","22","Ted ","No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect.",174,10294
"02","22","Robin ","Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies.",175,10295

"02","22","Man ","God, this guy's giving me nothing.",194,10314
"02","22","Ted ","All right, have fun in Scotland. If you see the Loch Ness Monster, tell him Ted Mosby says, ""What's up?""",195,10315

"03","05","Barney ","Barney. We met at the urinal.",109,11511
"03","05","Ted ","Oh right, hi.",110,11512
"03","05","Barney ","Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit.",111,11513
"03","05","Ted ","I'm not wearing a suit.",112,11514
"03","05","Barney ","Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A.",113,11515
"03","05","Barney ","Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes.",114,11516
"03","05","Barney ","Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward.",115,11517
"03","05","Barney ","(yelling at Ted) Edward, this is Audrey.",116,11518
"03","05","Audrey ","You know, I actually know some sign language.",117,11519
"03","05","Audrey ","(signing) Hi, my name is Audrey. Nice to meet you",118,11520
"03","05","Barney ","He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like.",119,11521
"03","05","Ted ","(signing) I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.",120,11522
"03","05","Barney ","What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.",121,11523
"03","05","Ted ","(signing) My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number.",122,11524
"03","05","Audrey ","Here. Call me.",123,11525
"03","05","Barney ","And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever.",124,11526
"03","05","Ted ","Barney, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.",125,11527
"03","05","Ted ","(signing) He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.",126,11528
"03","05","Barney ","Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online.",127,11529
"03","05","Blah-blah"," Oh my God, you told them.",128,11530
"03","05","Ted ","OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies.",129,11531
"03","05","Barney ","Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right?",130,11532
"03","05","Blah-blah"," Wait, you guys dated. For how long?",131,11533
"03","05","Robin ","A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about s*x, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?",132,11534
"03","05","Blah-blah"," Oh, I see what's going on here, Ted, I'm just some random girl to make Robin jealous and after she takes you back, you probably won't even remember my name.",133,11535
"03","05","Ted ","Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that.",134,11536
"03","05","Barney ","Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale.",135,11537
"03","05","Barney ","She started the night here",136,11538
"03","05","Barney ","But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone.",137,11539
"03","05","Barney ","Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to k*ll me with a brick.",138,11540
"03","05","Ted ","I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Robin.",139,11541
"03","05","Blah-blah"," Then why has she been trying to undermine me all night? I mean, look at her. She's laughing at me right now.",140,11542
"03","05","Blah-blah"," I'm sorry, it's just Lily and Marshall's story is so romantic. I just wish we had something like that.",141,11543
"03","05","Ted ","Their story is not as magical as it seems.",142,11544
"03","05","Blah-blah"," What do you mean?",143,11545
"03","05","Ted ","No, I can't, it's kind of a secret.",144,11546
"03","05","Blah-blah"," Well, how about I tell you a little secret about what you might get to do later tonight.",145,11547
"03","05","Ted ","The night before Lily met Marshall, there was this party.",146,11548
"03","05","College Ted"," Hey, you a freshwoman? I never use the word freshman. Sexist.",147,11549
"03","05","College Lily"," Yeah, I'm a first-year. I'm in Hewitt 220.",148,11550
"03","05","College Ted"," No way, Hewitt 110. You should totally come by.",149,11551
"03","05","College Lily"," Maybe I will, Hewitt 110.",150,11552
"03","05","College students"," Chug chug chug chug",151,11553
"03","05","College Ted"," These drunk idiots. Hey, don't drink their two dollar beer. This is a pinot noir from Europe.",152,11554
"03","05","College Lily"," Oh, it's fruity.",153,11555
"03","05","College Ted"," Yeah, I cut it with some cranberry juice, it's pretty strong.",154,11556
"03","05","College Lily"," So, uh, do you have a girlfriend?",155,11557
"03","05","College Ted"," Yeah. Not sure about the whole long distance thing though. It's like Descartes says, ""In order to determine whether we can know anything with certainty, we first have to doubt everything we know."" You know?",156,11558
"03","05","College Lily"," Wow.",157,11559
"03","05","Ted ","As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me.",158,11560
"03","05","Blah-blah"," Oh my God.",159,11561
"03","05","Ted ","Yeah, and in all these years Lily and I have never spoken about it, so again, mum's the word, OK?",160,11562
"03","05","Blah-blah"," You have to tell Marshall.",161,11563
"03","05","Ted ","If he heard that, it would destroy him.",162,11564
"03","05","Blah-blah"," If you don't tell him, I will.",163,11565
"03","05","Ted ","Oh, come on, you wouldn't.",164,11566
"03","05","Ted ","Oh no.",165,11567
"03","05","Blah-blah"," So, Lily, how did you and Ted meet? Come on, Lily, the real story.",166,11568
"03","05","Ted ","I don't think anyone wants to hear that story.",167,11569
"03","05","Lily ","Don't be embarrassed, Ted, it was a long time ago.",168,11570
"03","05","College Ted"," I made a huge mistake last night, but it's like Descartes says.",169,11571
"03","05","College Ted"," In order to determine whether there's anything we can know with certain, we first have to doubt everything we know. And I now know for certain that I love you, Karen. Anyway, call me back when you get this. I'm also going down to the computer center to send you an electronic mail.",170,11572
"03","05","College Marshall"," Ted, this is Lily.",171,11573
"03","05","College Ted"," No, no, I'm sorry but I love Karen.",172,11574
"03","05","Ted ","Yes, that is the unabridged story of how Lily and I met. How embarrassing. Who wants another round?",173,11575
"03","05","Blah-blah"," That's not the story, Ted, tell 'em.",174,11576
"03","05","Marshall ","Tell us what?",175,11577
"03","05","Ted ","Lily, will you help us get the next round?",176,11578
"03","05","Lily ","Ted, what's going on?",177,11579
"03","05","Ted ","She knows about us, about how we really met.",178,11580

"03","05","Ted ","Lily, come on.",186,11588
"03","05","Blah-blah"," I know that you and Ted made out the night before you met Marshall.",187,11589

"03","05","Ted ","Yeah, we did.",189,11591
"03","05","Lily ","I only made out with one other guy in college before I met Marshall, and it was just some random dude. I don't even remember his name. I just call him too-much-tongue guy.",190,11592
"03","05","Ted ","What? Too-much-tongue guy? I'm not surprised to hear that coming from unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.",191,11593
"03","05","Lily ","That wasn't me.",192,11594
"03","05","Ted ","Yes it was, at the freshman orientation party.",193,11595
"03","05","Lily ","No, no no no no no no no no no no no.",194,11596
"03","05","Barney ","How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin: Yeah, like five or six times.",195,11597
"03","05","Barney ","It was right over there.",196,11598
"03","05","Barney ","Here's your problem, you've only slept with one woman. Those kind of stats are only okay if you're eleven. But tonight, we're getting you a new girl because Marshall Eriksen, from this moment on, I make all your decisions for you.",197,11599
"03","05","Marshall ","I'm sorry, who are you again?",198,11600

"03","05","Barney ","I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed.",200,11602
"03","05","Ted ","You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.",201,11603
"03","05","Barney ","No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference.",202,11604
"03","05","Ted ","So we should make lots of Star Wars references around girls, that's what you're saying?",203,11605
"03","05","Marshall ","I'm not gonna cheat on my girlfriend.",204,11606
"03","05","Barney ","Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her.",205,11607
"03","05","Barney ","How much hotter is she than your girlfriend? Marshall: There's no comparison. What do you think, Ted? Go for it? Ted: Oh, don't do it, man. Think about Lily.",206,11608
"03","05","Marshall ","You know what, I don't care. I've been with one woman for too long. I need me some strange.",207,11609
"03","05","Barney ","Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger.",208,11610
"03","05","Barney ","Poor guy's gonna crash and burn.",209,11611
"03","05","Barney ","That man is a god.",210,11612

"03","14","Robin ","I do not.",180,13055
"03","14","Ted ","Have you ever fallen asleep while eating ribs?",181,13056
"03","14","Robin ","No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is.",182,13057
"03","14","Barney ","I'm in.",183,13058
"03","14","Robin ","Okay, here's how it's gonna work. Now, Lily...",184,13059
"03","14",NA,"Robin:...she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation.",185,13060
"03","14","Barney ","Talking, we should be talking. Words. Here are words. Why is this so hard? Laughter!",186,13061
"03","14","Robin ","And then I'll come in, looking hot as all hell.",187,13062
"03","14","Man ","Wow, you are gorgeous. Oh, God, I know that's awful.",188,13063
"03","14","Robin ","I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move.",189,13064
"03","14","Barney ","Hey, there, how are you doing?",190,13065
"03","14","Robin ","Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger.",191,13066
"03","14","Barney ","Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?",192,13067
"03","14","Robin ","Get your hand off my thigh, Barney.",193,13068
"03","14","Barney ","It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin.",194,13069
"03","14","Robin ","You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?",195,13070
"03","14","Barney ","Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?",196,13071
"03","14","Robin ","No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom.",197,13072
"03","14","Barney ","Uh, I'm going to go to the bathroom now, but, uh, when I come back we'll go to my place and have s*x.",198,13073
"03","14","Ted ","Dude, dude, dude, look. Blonde girl heading over to Robin right now. We are go.",199,13074
"03","14","Marshall ","I don't know what to do with my hands. What do I normally do with my hands? (Barney joins them at the booth) Barney. I brought a copy of the bracket. Which one is she?",200,13075
"03","14","Barney ","I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64.",201,13076
"03","14","Marshall ","Not even on bracket. Cinderella story comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing. That'll warm your heart.",202,13077
"03","14","Ted ","Are you okay?",203,13078
"03","14","Barney ","I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize.",204,13079
"03","14","Lily ","Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry.",205,13080
"03","14","Barney ","What? What?",206,13081
"03","14","Robin ","Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other.",207,13082
"03","14","Barney ","So I apologized for nothing?",208,13083
"03","14","Lily ","Yes, but it was a great apology. And a perfect way to end my scrapbook. I'm going to call this photo ""Barney's Redemption."" Could you stop giving me the finger?",209,13084
"03","14",NA,"Ted from 2030: Eventually, Barney did figure out who the mysterious girl was. But we on that later.",210,13085

"03","15",NA,"Ted from 2030: Kids,the spring of 2008 was a pretty great time for me. Stella and I had started dating, and I'd just gotten a big raise at work. So I decided to purchase something I knew would be the envy of all my friends.",1,13087
"03","15","Ted ","A new car!",2,13088
"03","15","Barney ","Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity!",3,13089
"03","15","Robin ","You can't call shotgun for eternity.",4,13090
"03","15","Barney ","I just called it.",5,13091
"03","15","Robin ","You can't just call things, barney.",6,13092

"03","15","Lily ","Are you okay?",10,13096
"03","15","Marshall ","Beer.",11,13097
"03","15","Ted ","Okay, what happened?",12,13098
"03","15","Marshall ","They always told me that working at a big law firm was like being at war...",13,13099
"03","15",NA,"Marshall:...You get out of law school, it's like getting out of boot camp. That first day at work, you're storming the beaches, full of piss and vinegar...",14,13100
"03","15","Man ","Dude, we're lawyers now.",15,13101
"03","15","Marshall ","Totally.",16,13102

"03","15","Marshall ","Totally empty. you?",20,13106
"03","15","Man ","Candy bars.",21,13107
"03","15","Marshall ","Then you get in the trenches side by side with your buddies. And you feel a sense of camaraderie. But before too long...",22,13108
"03","15","Arthur ","Hey, Marshall....",23,13109
"03","15",NA,"Marshall:...the shells start to fall. Hello, Arthur.",24,13110
"03","15","Marshall ","Arthur Hobbes is one of the senior partners at my firm, and he's... he's my boss. He seems like a nice guy, but he's got a nickname... Artillery arthur.",25,13111
"03","15","Arthur ","How's your morning going?",26,13112
"03","15","Marshall ","It's going fine. How is yours?",27,13113
"03","15","Arthur ","Not too bad, not too bad. Hey, is Ferguson in yet?",28,13114
"03","15","Marshall ","He is, he's in... just in his office next door.",29,13115
"03","15","Arthur ","That's great... have a good one, buddy.",30,13116
"03","15","Marshall ","You, too. (Arthur leaves Marshall's office) You never know who's gonna get hit...",31,13117
"03","15","Arthur ","Hey, Ferguson! I read your report, and it's complete crap! No, you know what? That's an insult to crap. If crap could eat and then crap stuff out, it's that! Your report is the crap that crap craps! If you last two more days here, I'll be shocked! Shocked!",32,13118
"03","15","Marshall ","It was brutal, But the worst was a few minutes later.",33,13119
"03","15","Ferguson ","Did you hear that?",34,13120
"03","15","Marshall ","Yeah, sorry.",35,13121
"03","15","Ferguson ","Can you believe he did that On ""Take-your-daughter-to-work"" day?",36,13122
"03","15","Marshall ","So that brings us to today. A little background. So I'm working on this report called ""Using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent to contest a class certification order based on a lack of commonality, numerosity...""",37,13123
"03","15","Ted ","Dude, you lost us. Can't you just call it something cool like ""the ninja report""?",38,13124
"03","15","Marshall ","Okay. yeah, fine, whatever. Um, so I'm supposed to turn in ""the ninja report"" yesterday. But I got insanely busy with other stuff, I didn't get a chance to finish it, and then this morning...",39,13125
"03","15","Arthur ","Hey, Ferguson.",40,13126
"03","15","Ferguson ","Hey, Arthur.",41,13127
"03","15","Arthur ","How's your day going?",42,13128
"03","15","Marshall ","I gotta go.",43,13129
"03","15","Ferguson ","Great. how is yours?",44,13130
"03","15","Arthur ","Great, great... Hey, is Marshall in yet?",45,13131
"03","15","Ferguson ","Oh, thank god. Yeah, he's right in there.",46,13132
"03","15","Arthur ","Fantastic. have a good one, buddy.",47,13133
"03","15","Marshall ","And then...",48,13134
"03","15","Marshall ","He screamed at me.",49,13135
"03","15","Lily ","Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.",50,13136
"03","15","Barney ","What, that's it? You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?",51,13137
"03","15","Marshall ","Barney, I have never been screamed at like that in my life.",52,13138
"03","15","Ted ","Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?",53,13139
"03","15","Barney ","I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business.",54,13140
"03","15","Lily ","Oh, baby, it's just not fair. You've been working so hard. Late nights, weekends. I never see you. We've barely made love in weeks. It's bad, guys, mama needs her sugar.",55,13141
"03","15","Robin ","Look, Marshall, he screamed at you, you took it. He probably respects you more for it.",56,13142
"03","15","Marshall ","Yeah, about that... So Arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment... Face turning red, vein in his forehead about to burst, spittle flying like shrapnel. Everyone you work with walking by your office, peering in. And suddenly, I just felt all of it.",57,13143
"03","15","Ted ","All of what?",58,13144
"03","15","Marshall ","All of it. The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment, and now I'm working for the bad guys instead. The fact that I am stuck in this job because of a mortgage I can barely afford on an apartment that is crooked. The fact that I am a grown man, and nobody, not even Artillery Arthur, has the right to talk to me like that!",59,13145
"03","15","Marshall ","I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...",60,13146
"03","15","Barney ","Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car.",61,13147
"03","15","Barney ","Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.",62,13148
"03","15","Marshall ","I don't know what happened. There's just something about being yelled at like that, like I was being scolded by my dad. Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.",63,13149
"03","15","Robin ","Is ""boy"" the right word?",64,13150
"03","15","Marshall ","I felt absolutely powerless. Flaccid... Hell, I... I felt castrated.",65,13151
"03","15","Lily ","God, you're hot right now.",66,13152
"03","15","Marshall ","And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report.",67,13153
"03","15","Barney ","Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.",68,13154
"03","15","Marshall ","How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?",69,13155
"03","15","Robin ","Here's what I would do if I were you.",70,13156
"03","15","Robin ","Hi, Arthur.",71,13157
"03","15","Arthur ","Hello, Marshall. Have you finally finished the ninja report?",72,13158
"03","15","Robin ","Yeah, I got it. Right here. I think it's gonna blow you away.",73,13159
"03","15","Arthur ","Please, I have a family.",74,13160
"03","15","Robin ","So we good?",75,13161
"03","15","Arthur ","We're so good.",76,13162
"03","15","Robin ","Then why are you still in my office?",77,13163
"03","15","Ted ","Okay, g*n violence might be the answer to everything up in Canada, Robin, but here in America, we solve our problems with words. Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy with a big eloquent speech defending human dignity. Like abraham Lincoln.",78,13164
"03","15","Marshall ","Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big, eloquent speech off the top of your head.",79,13165
"03","15","Ted ","Observe.",80,13166
"03","15","Ted ","Arthur?",81,13167
"03","15","Arthur ","What do you want, Marshall?",82,13168
"03","15","Ted ","Justice, sir. You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights, the most fundamentally paramount of which is the right... Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount. One means highest, one means lowest.",83,13169
"03","15","Arthur ","You are nailing this.",84,13170
"03","15","Ted ","Human beings have rights, and those rights are, um...",85,13171
"03","15","Arthur ","You got me hooked, reel me in.",86,13172
"03","15","Ted ","There are certain justices that cannot or will not be inalienable... as such... for the future.",87,13173
"03","15","Arthur ","Stuck the landing... bravo! Thank you. Security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.",88,13174
"03","15","Marshall ","Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay? I can't have some big confrontation with Arthur. I need this job, i... I need the money.",89,13175
"03","15","Ted ","Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow, tell him off and then quit?",90,13176
"03","15","Marshall ","It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it.",91,13177
"03","15","Barney ","Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.",92,13178
"03","15","Barney ","Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened.",93,13179
"03","15","Bilson ","You made yourself look bad, you made this company look bad, and quite frankly, you made our friends, the North Koreans, look bad! And I'll tell you something else, Blauman, if you think for one moment...",94,13180
"03","15","Blauman ","You know what, Bilson? You can kiss my ass.",95,13181
"03","15","Barney ","Oh, snap.",96,13182
"03","15","Bilson ","What?",97,13183
"03","15","Blauman ","You heard me. I don't need to take your crap anymore. My cousin's website went public today, and I made a pile of money on the ipo, so you know what I think Of this whole damn company?",98,13184
"03","15","Ted ","Oh, my God.",99,13185
"03","15","Marshall ","He peed on the conference table?",100,13186
"03","15","Blauman ","Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second till I get started? Come on. Come on.",101,13187
"03","15",NA,"Barney, pouring some water in a glass: Does this help?",102,13188
"03","15","Barney ","Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website tanked. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.",103,13189
"03","15","Marshall ","That's it? that's the end of the story?",104,13190
"03","15","Barney ","No, no, of course not... he died.",105,13191
"03","15","Marshall ","How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?",106,13192
"03","15","Barney ","Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming.",107,13193
"03","15","Marshall ","Chain of screaming?",108,13194
"03","15","Barney ","Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.",109,13195
"03","15","Ted ","I thought it was a chain of screaming.",110,13196
"03","15","Barney ","It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle.",111,13197
"03","15","Marshall ","I don't scream at Lily.",112,13198
"03","15","Lily ","And I don't scream at my kids, none of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.",113,13199
"03","15","Robin ","So it's not a circle.",114,13200
"03","15","Barney ","Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?",115,13201
"03","15","Marshall ","Lily, I need your take on this. What... what should I do?",116,13202
"03","15","Lily ","Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...",117,13203
"03","15","Barney ","Oh, God.",118,13204
"03","15",NA,"Lily:...When dealing with a bully, the most important thing is to be constructive and positive.",119,13205

"03","15","Arthur ","Hello, Marshall.",121,13207
"03","15","Lily ","I have the ninja report right here. But Arthur, in the future, if you want someone to do their best work, try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation, but through encouragement, inspiration and respect.",122,13208
"03","15","Arthur ","Well said, Marshall, I needed to hear that. By the way, I saw your wife's picture in your office. That is one tasty slice.",123,13209
"03","15","Lily ","Oh, you're damn right. You know what I'm gonna do when I get home?",124,13210
"03","15","Arthur ","Oh, yeah.",125,13211
"03","15","Lily ","I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...",126,13212
"03","15","Arthur ","That's it.",127,13213
"03","15",NA,"Lily:...just throw her on the bed...",128,13214
"03","15","Arthur ","That's where she belongs.",129,13215
"03","15",NA,"Lily:...and drive her home like a pack of sled dogs!",130,13216
"03","15","Lily ","It's bad, guys. Mama needs it bad.",131,13217
"03","15","Marshall ","You're right, baby, it's about respect. That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight. Can you give me that speech again?",132,13218
"03","15","Lily ","I'm gonna drive her home like a pack of...",133,13219
"03","15",NA,"Marshall:No, the other part, please.",134,13220

"03","15","Lily ","Which of these carpets would look better in the new apartment? I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft. It would feel great on your bare feet......or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat rolling down your trembling bosom.",137,13223
"03","15","Ted ","Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?",138,13224
"03","15","Marshall ","Shh, don't say my name. Lily can't know it's me. Just pretend you're talking to Stella. Be all lovey dovey.",139,13225
"03","15","Ted ","Hey, Stella. Sweetie, how's it going?",140,13226
"03","15","Marshall ","Not good, not good at all.",141,13227
"03","15","Ted ","Where are you right now?",142,13228
"03","15","Marshall ","Right downstairs, come find me. Without Lily.",143,13229
"03","15","Ted ","Okay, I'll see you soon.",144,13230

"03","15","Ted ","Apparently.",148,13234
"03","15","Lily ","You hitting that?",149,13235
"03","15","Marshall ","I'm in trouble, Ted. Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.",150,13236
"03","15","Ted ","Um... it's a new car, so just be careful...",151,13237
"03","15","Marshall ","I did something stupid, can we just drive somewhere? I need to get away... just drive, man. Please just drive.",152,13238
"03","15","Ted ","It's just, this is a really good parking spot.",153,13239

"03","15","Ted ","Look, just tell me what happened first.",155,13241
"03","15","Marshall ","Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech that Lily told me to give, be firm but respectful? Well, it didn't totally go that way.",156,13242
"03","15","Ted ","There is a lot of ketchup on that burger. Sorry, what happened?",157,13243
"03","15","Marshall ","After we all finished talking last night, I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.",158,13244

"03","15","Marshall ","Who would I even scream at?",172,13258

"03","18","Ted ","It's a lot of pressure, isn't it?",83,13880
"03","18","Lily ","You know what? It's not. This woman needs it bad. Anything you do is going to be fireworks. I remember my longest drought...",84,13881

"03","18","Ted ","Not Nell Carter... Stella.",91,13888
"03","18","Marshall ","Dude, relax, it's all about expectations management. Do you know why I hated Jerry Maguire so much?",92,13889
"03","18","Ted ","Because you're dead inside?",93,13890
"03","18","Marshall ","No, because you built it up for, like, two weeks, saying it was the greatest movie ever. With Stella, do the opposite: lower expectations.",94,13891
"03","18","Ted ","Right, right, and then no matter what happens, she'll be happy.",95,13892
"03","18","Marshall (in the phone) ","Hey, buddy. I'm married, Barney, I cannot be your new wingman. (Marshall hangs up, then Robin's phone rings, she picks up the phone and say directly...)",96,13893

"03","18","Stella ","What?",103,13900
"03","18","Ted ","This potato skin. It's good but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head. Even though potato skin performed admirably, and is a totally respectable size... I couldn't enjoy it because of my own unrealistic expectations.",104,13901
"03","18","Stella ","Hmm, Ted, I see what you're doing. You're trying to lower my expectations for tonight. Is this a lengh thing?",105,13902

"04","01","Barney ","Is insurance going to cover that? Sometimes they don't.",154,14356
"04","01","Robin ","That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man.",155,14357

"04","01","Stella ","It was so good.",195,14397
"04","01","Marshall ","You hated it, didn't you?",196,14398
"04","01","Stella ","It's so stupid. First of all, how do they understand that walking bear they hang around with all the time?",197,14399
"04","01","Marshall ","Wookiee.",198,14400

"04","01","Marshall ","He's a Wookiee, and his kind is actually more intelligent than they appear. That is Ted's favorite movie of all time. He watches it when he's home sick with the flu. He watches it on rainy Sunday afternoons in the fall. He watches it on Christmas Eve. Ted watches Star Wars in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad. Do you really think that you can pretend to like a movie that you actually hate for the rest of your life?",200,14402

"04","01","Robin ","You were so nice to me tonight, I wanted to return the favor, wingwoman-style. So, as I was saying, Barney is the Yankees' new second-baseman. And Barney, April asked if tomorrow, you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match. You can't make this stuff up. So, you two kids have fun.",206,14408
"04","01","April ","So are you... nervous about the game?",207,14409
"04","01","Barney ","Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not. I'm just some guy who's in love with the girl that just left, and she's never going to feel the same way. So I'm just going to go.",208,14410
"04","01","Barney ","And that was it.",209,14411

"04","01","Barney ","I choose bimbos.",214,14416
"04","01","Lily ","What?",215,14417
"04","01","Barney ","Bimbos make me happy. Bimbos make me feel alive. Bimbos make me want to pretend to be a better man. This whole thing with Robin was just a fling, but at the end of the day, my heart belongs to bimbos.",216,14418
"04","01","Lily ","This is just a defense mechanism, because you're afraid of getting hurt. You're just confused.",217,14419
"04","01","Barney ","Oh, I'm not confused. You know who is confused? Bimbos. They're easily confused. It's one of the thousand little things I love about them. I love their vacant, trusting stares, their sluggish, unencumbered minds, their unresolved daddy issues. I love them and they love me. Bimbos have always been there for me, through thick and thin. Mostly thin. B- man don't do thick crust. What up?",218,14420

The streets got a little cleaner, the rents got a little higher, and one by one, the crappy old places we loved began to disappear. The Elbow Room, an old punk rock club, became a drugstore. McHale's, a working-class watering hole, became a fast-food place. And Fez, a Moroccan-themed lounge, became a bank. And not just any bank.",1,14422

And then... a pickle the most... playful... little pickle, and then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce, and a... a patty... of ground beef, so... exquisite...swirling in your mouth, breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savories so... delightful.

"05","03","Ted ","Correct! And if she achieves that, will she truly be happy?",171,20007
"05","03","Barney ","No! Robin's deep-seated need for attention can traced back to her father's emotional distance, and no amount of success will ever make up for what she truly needs, which is six simple words from her Dad: ""Robin, I'm proud of you, eh?""",172,20008

"05","03","Robin ","You know, in a way, I was right. You cheated. You can't get some crib sheet on dating me. That's not how it works. If we didn't figure out how to be with each other in a real, honest way, I don't see the point of even trying.",217,20053
"05","03","Robin ","What do you want?",218,20054

"05","03","Robin ","I guess I'm impressed by how much you remembered.",220,20056
"05","03","Ted ","It's funny. When you date someone, it's like you're taking one long course in who that person is and then, when you break up, all that stuff becomes useless. It's the emotional equivalent of an English degree. I guess I just liked the idea of putting all my Robin Scherbatsky knowledge to good use, you know?",221,20057
"05","03","Robin ","Well, since you know me pretty well... am I fooling myself with this whole Barney thing?",222,20058
"05","03","Ted ","I don't know. I will say this, though. I've seen Barney work very hard to get women. I've seen him work very hard to get rid of women. I've never seen him work this hard to keep one around. I was going to give him an A. Well, B+ -- Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve.",223,20059

"05","04","Ted ","Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?",102,20174
"05","04","Barney ","Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, ""where do you live?""And she said, ""one block south."". I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you",103,20175
"05","04","Ted ","Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?",104,20176

"05","05","Marshall ","That is not true.",187,20471

Don't know what board game this came from, but it's a ""jhoke"". Number two- and this is the biggie- Quit letting awesome chicks like Robin Scherbatsky get away because, guess what? You don't want her? I'm planting my flag in her- if you know what I mean, which you probably don't- and getting her the hell out of here. You may now return to being pointless.

For so long, it had been just me and him, but now he suddenly felt like Helen had taken his place. What Sparky didn't realize was, even though I loved Helen, I still loved him, too. I had room in my heart for both of them. But maybe I should have put aside some special ball-tossing time just for the two of us t o make sure Sparky knew that he was a good boy. I wish now I had, 'cause old Sparky ran out in front of a Cadillac and got splattered like a watermelon in one of them Gallagher shows.",193,20477

"05","05","Ted ","I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. I never should have been mad at you!",195,20479

"05","05","Barney ","Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday.",202,20486

"05","06","Barney ","I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, ""Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel"" is what you will paint the?",53,20564
"05","06","Lily ","No. Of course not.",54,20565

"05","06","Marshall ","He's right.",67,20578

"05","06","Robin ","I think that's true.",77,20588

"05","06","Robin ","You know what? It's true. We tried to find out which of us was most great. But it said draw and we made love. Speaking of that, I am delighted that we go skiing this weekend. I need a break. The upstairs neighbors make me crazy.",80,20591

"05","06","Ted ","A second time. This is a bad idea.",88,20599
"05","06","Marshall ","Barney argued logically. Lily is a reasonable woman. I think if I explain, understand and can go in my opinion.",89,20600

"05","06","Marshall ","It started with the dishes but after...",115,20626

"05","20","Ted ","Watching my mother to marry, I realized how I was late in relation to it on my life. I'm just going to leave here. So I walked into my hotel room and I went on a website where I go sometimes when I have trouble sleeping.",61,23720

"05","20","Marshall ","Try not to laugh with you that, man.",70,23729
"05","20","Ted ","So, I thought this piece would be the desktop. You see, a place just for dad. I mean, kids can come if they read a book, but no toy. This is not about to hold my love. It is rather a question of drawing a boundary.",71,23730
"05","20","Robin ","Whoa.",72,23731
"05","20","Lily ","Ted, you're barge. It will take years and a small fortune for it to be liveable.",73,23732

"05","20","Ted ","Thank you.",82,23741

"05","20","Robin ","My God, you had to be completely stuffed.",84,23743
"05","20","Barney ","No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened.",85,23744

"05","20","All ","Hey! Hey! Hey!",112,23771
"05","20","Marshall ","Okay! Well! Well, just remember that we all did stupid stuff in our lives, okay? For example, once I tried to cycle on an extension ladder to a roof of a two-story house. The only question is I was a kid or drunk? Drum roll, please.",113,23772
"05","20","Marshall ","I was...",114,23773

"05","20","Lily ","Ted, stop that. You can not keep this house. This is a huge mistake.",120,23779
"05","20","Ted ","Lily, listen to me. I had a plan, right? A woman, a house, children, and it turned out that the universe is really shit to what is the wife and children. So what is the thing I can control? The house I bought. It's not a huge mistake.",121,23780
"05","20","Marshall ","Exactly. Now, I currently drive the car of my brother in the opposite direction on I-94. Now that was a big mistake. I was... a kid.",122,23781
"05","20","Robin ","Wow, Barney. You've been crying about this guy or what?",123,23782

"05","20","Lily ","You see, you should have waited to see all the problems that home.",125,23784
"05","20","Ted ","You can always have problems with any decision, but you can not let that stop you. First day in college, Marshall knew he wanted to spend his life with you. And if someone was there to contradict his decision?",126,23785
"05","20","Marshall ","I know this is our second hot date but, Lily Aldrin, I will marry you.",127,23786
"05","20","Man ","Not so fast. (He brings Lily in the room) was some form of problem here. These hips are not suitable for a baby Eriksen.And that thing she does not have the right filter. This is a maintenance problem that never leave. And I know you think like this gothic look now. But basically, you've always imagined with a Spanish style? I would recommend you take a look at the options in the lease.",128,23787
"05","20","Ted ","But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.",129,23788
"05","20","Barney ","It was Robin! ""What! ""Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know.",130,23789
"05","20","Robin ","Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?",131,23790
"05","20","Barney ","Of course.",132,23791
"05","20","Robin ","I made a mistake in letting you go, right? Your pen1s is huge.",133,23792
"05","20","Lily ","Boy, you've almost had us still.",134,23793
"05","20","Marshall ","You're always a little too far.",135,23794
"05","20","Barney ","Shit.",136,23795
"05","20","Man ","Well, good news. I think we all will soon be out of here.",137,23796
"05","20","Ted ","Really?",138,23797
"05","20","Man ","Yes, I ended up downstairs and outside. Now, I could continue to look and see what I could do except black mold, bearing walls damaged, frayed electrical son, lead paint, water damage, fire damage, sun damage, off the cares, the floor is rotting... Oh, look at that, not termites. The chimney cracked, bats, rats, spiders, raccoons, the tramp, the gutter parts, the old fuse box, paint the kitchen which is not bad, but really swear the plates with the plans working. Or I could advise you not to buy this miserable house Guantanamo Bay, and suggest you break all by before a wind blowing through all son of bitches from here.",139,23798
"05","20","Ted ","And if I had already bought the son of a bitch?",140,23799
"05","20","Man ","I'll see at the top if all goes well.",141,23800
"05","20","Marshall ","He said he had found a tramp?",142,23801
"05","20","Ted ","Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here.",143,23802
"05","20","Barney ","I see a complaint.",144,23803
"05","20","Man ","Found termites.",145,23804
"05","20","Robin ","Hey, good, good news is that the inspector has k*lled some cockroaches at the time of impact.",146,23805
"05","20","Lily ","Oh, stay there. Huge hole on the second floor. I just want to be sure the report is accurate.",147,23806
"05","20","Ted ","You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie?",148,23807
"05","20","Barney ","Thank you. My God.",149,23808
"05","20","Ted ","Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house.",150,23809
"05","20","Barney ","OK, buddy. Sometimes people make bad decisions in life. Like your mother.",151,23810

"06","02","Lily ","Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world?",52,24945
"06","02","Barney ","I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",53,24946
"06","02","Barney ","I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",54,24947
"06","02","Marshall ","That sounds plausible.",55,24948
"06","02","Barney ","Hey. It's true. Tell him, James.",56,24949
"06","02","James ","Oh, yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap. He would hit it from the outside, hit it from the inside... He sucked. Coach cut him from the team, and Mom fed him that story so he'd feel better.",57,24950
"06","02","Barney ","Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this...",58,24951
"06","02","Barney ","""Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10:00 in the morning, she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool. Love, Postmaster General.",59,24952
"06","02","Barney ","Thank you.",60,24953
"06","02","Marshall ","Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot?",61,24954
"06","02","James ","Constantly. I mean, she put more effort into some lies than others.",62,24955
"06","02","Barney ","Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?",63,24956
"06","02","Loretta ","Oh, I don't know... That guy.",64,24957
"06","02","Robin ","Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too?",65,24958
"06","02","James ","No. No, no. I heard Flip Wilson, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Meadowlark Lemon... The list goes on. I still can't get a straight answer about who my real dad is. And Barney's no help. He still believes every lie that my mom told us growing up. Not me. I caught on early.",66,24959
"06","02","Barney ","Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth...",67,24960
"06","02","Ted ","Damn. Loretta really lied a lot to her kids.",68,24961
"06","02","Lily ","Well, she's not alone. Whenever Marshall was acting too hyper, his mom would suddenly decide he was ""sick"" and give him cough medicine until he passed out.",69,24962
"06","02","Marshall ","I'm pretty sure that's what stunted my growth. I hit 6'4"" in the fifth grade, and then I just stopped.",70,24963
"06","02","Lily ","And then there's the most popular parental lie in history. Santa.",71,24964
"06","02","Marshall ","Yeah, but that's a good lie. Like when we tell Ted he'll meet the right girl and settle down.",72,24965
"06","02","Ted ","I always find that reassuring.",73,24966
"06","02","Marshall ","You will meet her, buddy.",74,24967
"06","02","Ted ","You think so?",75,24968
"06","02","Marshall ","Yeah!",76,24969
"06","02","Lily ","Santa's still a lie, and I'm not lying to our kids.",77,24970
"06","02","Marshall ","Baby, it's Santa. Don't you want our kids going to sleep on Christmas Eve with their hearts full of hope, their heads full of crazy cough syrup nightmares, knowing that downstairs Kris Kringle is stuffing their stockings full of joy and stuffing his belly full of milk and lutefisk that they left him?",78,24971
"06","02","Lily ","Milk and lutefisk? Santa doesn't get cookies in Minnesota?",79,24972
"06","02","Marshall ","Yeah, that's just what Santa needs at 3:00 a.m. when he's battling a snowstorm over the Rockies: a sugar crash. No. Santa needs protein.",80,24973
"06","02","Lily ","I'm not lying to our kids.",81,24974
"06","02","Barney ","Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class.",82,24975
"06","02","James ","Funny how all these girls have the exact same handwriting as the Postmaster General, Mom, and... home run king, Frank Aaron.",83,24976
"06","02","Barney ","Yeah, school girls... The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't... Who's Sam Gibbs?",84,24977
"06","02","James ","No idea. Why?",85,24978
"06","02","Barney ","Mom addressed this and never sent it.",86,24979
"06","02","James ","What's in it?",87,24980
"06","02","Barney ","Hey. (laughs) It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote... ""Your son.""",88,24981
"06","02","Loretta ","Okay, everyone, lunch is ready. Who wants Sloppy Joes?",89,24982
"06","02","James ","Mom, who's Sam Gibbs?",90,24983
"06","02","Loretta ","That doesn't sound familiar. Who wants Sloppy Joes?",91,24984
"06","02","James ","There's a picture of me and Barney in an envelope addressed to him. And you wrote ""your son"" on the back.",92,24985
"06","02","Loretta ","Oh, no, that... It says ""Yourson."" For Yourson, North Dakota. That's where we took the picture. Lovely town. We went kayaking, and you two rescued the mayor's dog, which had wandered into the rapids. That mayor, Sam Gibbs, asked for your picture so the city could make statues of you both. I guess I never sent it. That's embarrassing. Now, how about those Sloppy Joes?",93,24986
"06","02","James ","If this picture was taken in North Dakota, then why is our old swing set in the background?",94,24987
"06","02","Loretta ","I don't know! I did my best as a single parent, and it wasn't always easy, and I'd recommend putting the coleslaw right on top of the Sloppy Joe, because it's delicious that way!",95,24988
"06","02","James ","Can you believe her?",96,24989
"06","02","Barney ","I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom!",97,24990
"06","02","Robin ","So, Ted? You were worried that I oversold you to Liz. Well, I fixed it.",98,24991
"06","02","Ted ","How?",99,24992
"06","02","Robin ","I sent her another email. ""Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound like I was trying to oversell Ted. The truth is, he is a genuinely nice, down to earth guy, and I think you two would really hit it off.""",100,24993
"06","02","Ted ","Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect. That totally takes the pressure...",101,24994
"06","02","Robin ","""Is he going to rock your world in bed? No. But he's clean, open to criticism, and not into anything too weird. He's not bad at all. Not bad at all.""",102,24995
"06","02","Ted ","See, now you went too far in the other...",103,24996
"06","02","Robin ","""I'll be honest. The first few times aren't going to be that great. He's going to say 'Are you finished?' more times than a waiter in a busy restaurant.""",104,24997
"06","02","Ted ","Stop!",105,24998
"06","02","James ","Listen to me. There is no Yourson, North Dakota. Mom... And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor. He might be one of our fathers.",106,24999
"06","02","Barney ","Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker.",107,25000
"06","02","James ","Barney! You... You've got to stop living in these fairy tales that Mom told us! Bob Barker is not your father. Sam Gibbs might be, but Bob Barker is absolutely, unequivocally not your father.",108,25001
"06","02","Marshall ","I suppose you have a problem with the Easter Bunny, too.",109,25002
"06","02","Lily ","Not now.",110,25003
"06","02","James ","This address isn't too far. Are you coming with me, or not?",111,25004
"06","02","Barney ","So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy.",112,25005
"06","02","James ","You're just too scared to face the truth. You're living in a dream world.",113,25006
"06","02","Marshall ","Maybe we shouldn't have brought these Sloppy Joes.",114,25007
"06","02","Lily ","Oh, what's done is done.",115,25008
"06","02","Ted ","""Ted Mosby is solid as a rock."" No. ""Dependable."" No. ""Rugged."" No.",116,25009
"06","02","Robin ","Why don't I just go to the Chevy Web site and copy down adjectives?",117,25010
"06","02","Ted ","I just want to hit that perfect middle ground.",118,25011
"06","02","Robin ","How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out? ""Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, and really rich, but lacks bladder control."" Oh, damn.",119,25012
"06","02","Ted ","What?",120,25013
"06","02","Robin ","That last bump just made me hit send.",121,25014

"06","02","James ","I thought you said that he... Stop.",128,25021
"06","02","Barney ","Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really... you know. I'm not crazy. I just... I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up.",129,25022

"06","02","Sam ","Oh, my head's kind of spinning, too. I mean, Loretta and I only saw each other for a couple of months. You were two before I even knew you existed, and at that point, your mother made it very clear she was going to raise you on her own. I felt I had to respect her wishes, but I always wanted to meet you.",142,25035
"06","02","Ted ","Wait. Barney and James are two years apart. If Sam only knew Loretta for a few months, he couldn't possibly be Barney's father.",143,25036
"06","02","Robin ","He's also quite the detective.",144,25037
"06","02","Lily ","Don't worry. We'll... We'll snap Barney out of this when he gets back.",145,25038

"06","02","Barney ","Man... I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about.",152,25045

"06","03","Marshall ","But that won't happen on your watch... you know why? Because you're Ted Mosby! And you are gonna design the most beautiful, ventless, Rebel-proof building in Manhattan, with clearly marked emergency stops for every trash compactor on the detention level.",56,25137
"06","03","Ted ","Look, I know this is hard to understand, but right now, I have a quiet, simple, happy little life. And I like it that way. I know what my answer has to be.",57,25138
"06","03","Ted ","I can't take the job, Barney. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings?",58,25139
"06","03","Barney ","Of course not.",59,25140
"06","03","Ted ","All right.",60,25141
"06","03",NA,"Ted from 2030: And I thought that was the end of the story. But then that night...",61,25142
"06","03","Ted ","I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Barney, back me up. Barney. Dude, this is important.",62,25143
"06","03","Barney ","I need another drink.",63,25144
"06","03","Ted ","Marshall, you want anything?",64,25145
"06","03","Marshall ","No, I'm fine.",65,25146
"06","03","Ted ","Okay, I get that he's mad at me for turning down the job, but acting like I'm not even here?",66,25147
"06","03","Marshall ","Wait, you turned down the job? When?",67,25148
"06","03","Ted ","This morning.",68,25149
"06","03","Marshall ","That's so weird. Just, like, an hour ago, when we were leaving work...",69,25150
"06","03","Marshall ","So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job?",70,25151
"06","03","Barney ","Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes.",71,25152
"06","03","Ted ","Am I wrong or is that exactly what Barney says when he's putting the moves on a girl?",72,25153
"06","03","Marshall ","Exactly. I mean, it's almost like he's putting the moves on you.",73,25154
"06","03","Ted ","Yeah, more like the opposite. He's been ignoring me all night. Barney wants me to take the job so bad he's putting the moves on me?",74,25155
"06","03","Marshall ","I hope that's his end game. Actually, I don't. I like you two together.",75,25156
"06","03","Ted ","I don't buy it. That's crazy, even for Barney.",76,25157
"06","03","Marshall ","Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl?",77,25158
"06","03","Barney ","Chrissy, I love your glasses.",78,25159
"06","03","Chrissy ","Really?",79,25160
"06","03","Barney ","They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy.",80,25161
"06","03","Marshall ","The backhanded compliment to lower her self-esteem... a proven winner.",81,25162
"06","03","Ted ","But Barney hasn't done...",82,25163
"06","03","Barney ","Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community. You stick with it. To Ted.",83,25164
"06","03","Robin ","Hey, Lily!",84,25165
"06","03","Lily ","Don't ""Hey, Lily"" me. I smelled poop all the way from the hallway.",85,25166
"06","03","Robin ","Oh, no, not this again.",86,25167
"06","03","Lily ","Where's the poop, Robin?",87,25168
"06","03","Robin ","Okay, I left Don another message.",88,25169
"06","03","Robin ","""This just in"" is what I'm gonna say when I'm stabbing you.",89,25170
"06","03","Lily ","But that's impossible. You deleted his number.",90,25171
"06","03","Robin ","I tried to. But then this thing popped up on my phone that said, ""Are you sure?"" And I wasn't sure. I can't lie to my phone.",91,25172
"06","03",NA,"Lily:Oh, sweetie, I totally understand. Delete it!",92,25173
"06","03","Robin ","It's not that easy, okay? You're not just deleting a number, you're deleting a part of your life. You know, all those memories, all those experiences. It's like you're admitting they're gone forever.",93,25174
"06","03","Lily ","I know, sweetie. I know. Delete it!",94,25175
"06","03","Robin ","Okay, if it's that easy, I'm gonna delete one of your numbers from your phone, see how you like it.",95,25176
"06","03","Lily ","My ""plezh."" If you can find a number in there that I don't call regularly, I'll gladly delete it.",96,25177
"06","03","Robin ","Super Kicks Karate.",97,25178
"06","03","Lily ","No, not that one. That's my dojo.",98,25179
"06","03","Robin ","You have a dojo?",99,25180
"06","03","Lily ","I took an introductory karate class.",100,25181
"06","03","Lily ","Ops, wrong room. Where do the grown-ups go for the real karate class?",101,25182
"06","03","Boy ","What's the matter, lady? You scared?",102,25183
"06","03","Lily ","Of you? Please. I'm a kindergarten teacher.",103,25184
"06","03","Boy ","I hated kindergarten. All three times.",104,25185
"06","03","Lily ","But I'm totally gonna sign up for more lessons.",105,25186
"06","03","Robin ","How long ago did you take that class?",106,25187
"06","03","Lily ","I don't know. It was around the time when everyone was going, ""Wassuuuuuuup!""",107,25188
"06","03","Robin ","How do you even remember that? Lily, this is a number that you will never dial again.",108,25189
"06","03","Lily ","I might.",109,25190
"06","03","Robin ","No, no. But you keep it in your phone because it reminds you of a version of yourself that you could be, even if it's a version of yourself that you'll never become. And that's okay.",110,25191
"06","03","Lily ","No, it's not. Okay, you know what? There, gone. Your move, Scherbatsky.",111,25192
"06","03","Ted ","I finally know what your kind goes through. I get it now.",112,25193
"06","03","Robin ","For the last time, I don't care how big it was, it is not the same as giving birth.",113,25194
"06","03","Marshall ","No! Barney's been ""putting the moves"" on Ted.",114,25195
"06","03","Lily ","Oh, that sucks. Although I like you two together.",115,25196
"06","03","Marshall ","No, he's been doing it to try to get Ted to design the new GNB Tower.",116,25197
"06","03","Robin ","Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?",117,25198
"06","03","Barney ","Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks! (...) Man, the courtside Knicks seats that are available to all upper level GNB employees are too close to the action. I keep getting sweat on my suit. It sucks! (...) Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks!",118,25199
"06","03","Ted ","He did.",119,25200
"06","03","Robin ","And the intense eye contact thing?",120,25201
"06","03","Barney ","So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers?",121,25202
"06","03","Ted ","Okay. Yep.",122,25203
"06","03","Robin ","And the thing where he establishs intimacy through physical contact?",123,25204
"06","03","Ted ","You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese.",124,25205
"06","03","Barney ","That is so true.",125,25206
"06","03","Ted ","Yeah... Cream cheese has a mild flav-flavor so it... it balances out the spiciness of the jal... the spiciness of the... Dude!",126,25207
"06","03","Robin ","So at any point in this did you say, ""Barney, I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. I am not taking that job""?",127,25208
"06","03","Ted ","Well, I mean, not exactly in those...",128,25209
"06","03","Lily ","You're loving this.",129,25210
"06","03","Ted ","No.",130,25211
"06","03","Lily ","You are. You're loving the attention.",131,25212
"06","03","Ted ","It's nice to be wanted, okay? And, yes, this is a new vest. Thank you all for noticing. Oh, that's right, you didn't. Barney did!",132,25213
"06","03","Robin ","Oh, Teddy, you are so going to spread your legs and design that building.",133,25214
"06","03","Ted ","I am not that kind of architect. So get this...",134,25215
"06","03","Lily ","Robin never deleted Don's number.",135,25216
"06","03","Robin ","Oh, everyone thinks it's so easy. Give me your phone. Let's delete one of yours.",136,25217
"06","03","Marshall ","Okay. No problem. If you can find a number that I don't need or shouldn't have in here, be my guest, but good luck. I keep my phone tight.",137,25218
"06","03","Robin ","Edwin.",138,25219
"06","03","Marshall ","Oh, no, not that one. That's the booker for the club that my band plays at. You know, my all-lawyer funk band... you remember... The Funk, the Whole Funk and Nothing but the Funk.",139,25220
"06","03","Robin ","You guys played one gig four years ago. I'm deleting it.",140,25221
"06","03","Marshall ","No, no, we're gonna... we're gonna play another gig again. Probably really soon. It's just we all got super busy, and... We're not going to play another gig again, are we?",141,25222
"06","03","Lily ","Probably not, baby.",142,25223
"06","03","Robin ","See, it's hard to hit that delete button, isn't it?",143,25224
"06","03","Marshall ","Well, it's just that without that number in my phone, I'm just a corporate lawyer working 60 very un-funky hours a week.",144,25225
"06","03","Robin ","Sorry, Marshall. But if I have to, you have to.",145,25226
"06","03","Lily ","Okay. Your turn.",146,25227
"06","03","Ted ","Barney, I gotta tell you something.",147,25228
"06","03","Barney ","Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you?",148,25229
"06","03","Ted ","Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower.",149,25230
"06","03","Barney ","Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else.",150,25231
"06","03","Ted ","Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, ""pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more."" It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, ""Oh, God, I never should have said no.""",151,25232
"06","03","Marshall ","It's not a move, dude. I executed the paperwork for the new architect this morning. Barney wasn't lying.",152,25233
"06","03","Ted ","Oh, God, I never should have said no! Come on, GNB didn't really hire a new architect. This is just one of Barney's moves.",153,25234
"06","03","Marshall ","It's not a move, dude. The senior partners were getting impatient. I thought you didn't even want the job.",154,25235
"06","03","Ted ","I didn't! I don't! I don't. I don't!",155,25236
"06","03","Ted ","Okay, I'll do it!",156,25237
"06","03","Barney ","What? Ted, it's too late.",157,25238
"06","03","Ted ","I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.",158,25239
"06","03","Barney ","Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank...",159,25240
"06","03","Marshall ","Okay, it's a move.",160,25241
"06","03","Ted ","What?",161,25242
"06","03","Barney ","Dude!",162,25243
"06","03","Marshall ","There is no other architect. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied. I was being Barney's wingman, and I never get to be the wingman.",163,25244
"06","03","Ted ","You guys lied to me?",164,25245
"06","03","Barney ","You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here.",165,25246
"06","03","Marshall ","I can do better. Take me back. You son of a bitch!",166,25247
"06","03","Ted ","Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me.",167,25248
"06","03","Barney ","We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job.",168,25249
"06","03","Ted ","No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women...",169,25250

"06","03",NA,"Ted:...before me fell for. Wow, respect.",171,25252
"06","03","Marshall ","No... Ted... you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me.",172,25253
"06","03","Barney ","Come on, Ted! This is your dream.",173,25254
"06","03","Ted ","No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no.",174,25255
"06","03","Robin ","Hey, guys.",175,25256
"06","03","Lily ","Where's the poop, Robin?",176,25257

"06","03","Marshall ","I think that's just called a dog.",178,25259
"06","03","Lily ","Where's the poop, Robin?",179,25260
"06","03","Robin ","Fine. I called Don again.",180,25261
"06","03","Robin ","Hey, Don! It's Robin again. Look, I am sorry for all the calls. It's just, I saw you on the news, and it made me a little crazy for a minute. I guess I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought. But I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to k*ll you. No... No, I'm not. I am happy for you. And that Asian slut on your Facebook page. She's dead, too.",181,25262
"06","03","Lily ","I thought you deleted his number.",182,25263
"06","03","Robin ","I did, but it turns out, I memorized it. You can't delete contacts from your brain, Lily.",183,25264
"06","03","Lily ","Well, you have to try. If you ever want to have closure...",184,25265
"06","03","Robin ","I am never going to have closure. Okay? Closure doesn't exist. Okay, one day, Don and I are moving in together, and the next thing I know, he's on a plane to Chicago. It just... ended. And no matter how much I try to forget that it happened, it will have never not happened. Don and I will always be a loose end. We'll always be...",185,25266
"06","03","Ted ","Unfinished. Gaudi, to his credit, never gave up on his dream, but that's not usually how it goes. I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy, weird church from getting built. Most of the time, it's just too difficult or too expensive, or too scary. It's only once you've stopped that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it. But it's always there. And until you finish it, it will always be...",186,25267

"06","07","Zoey ","Boo freakin' hoo? That's it? The Arcadian is an architecturally significant...",55,25987
"06","07","Ted ","Architecturally significant?! Zoey, you're very pretty. Your hair smells great.",56,25988

"06","07","Ted ","I'm a professor, okay? I teach this stuff at one of the best colleges in the country. I don't go down to your place of non-employment and lecture you about how your little protest is a misguided waste of time, except whoops, I just did. Ha-burn.",60,25992

"06","07","Lily ","Johnny? Johnny!",105,26037
"06","07","Lily ","He and that little stuffed horsey raised all kinds of hell. But I have a simple method for shutting down troublemakers. You know that '98 Taurus that's always parked outside? The one with the really annoying alarm?",106,26038

"06","07","Barney ","Marshall popped his cherry! Oh! Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster. I mean, it reflected badly on the company. He was an embarrassment. A huge embarrassment.",120,26052

"06","07","Arthur ","That was a mistake. You should have fired him a year ago.",137,26069
"06","07","Marshall ","No, sir, that is what's wrong with this company. How can we say ""GNB Cares,"" and then turn around and treat someone like that? I mean, sure, he made a few mistakes but everybody makes mistakes. Like, like Tugboat here. Aw. I bet you he's made some mistakes. And you didn't fire Tugboat, did you?",138,26070
"06","07","Arthur ","No, I got him fixed, and he calmed down.",139,26071

"06","07","Arthur ","I changed the ice pack on his crotch every hour for three days. Wow, Eriksen, if you want to un-fire Randy, I support you, because to come in here and say what you just said, well, you've got a couple things that Tugboat doesn't.",143,26075

"06","09","Barney ","Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers? Get mad at each other and wrestle, but then end up kissing in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily.",38,26405
"06","09","Robin ","Barney, you know what? If you're going to be disgusting, we're not watching this, okay?",39,26406
"06","09","Lily ","Yeah. Come on, Barney. It's just a cute little story about... What exactly is this about?",40,26407
"06","09","Robin ","Oh, two average Canadian teenagers who solve crimes in space using math.",41,26408
"06","09","Marshall ","That sounds ridiculous.",42,26409
"06","09","Robin Sparkles"," So sue me. Like the producers of Milky Way Mathletes tried to.",43,26410
"06","09","Jessica Glitter"," Great job using long division to catch that space burglar, eh?",44,26411
"06","09","Robin Sparkles"," Well, what can I say? He'll be in galactic jail for the remainder of his life.",45,26412
"06","09","Robot ","Sparkles, Glitter, we're about to enter an asteroid belt, eh.",46,26413
"06","09","Robin Sparkles"," Brace for turbulence!",47,26414
"06","09","Lily ","Oh. Oh. I have to say, as much as I hate to agree with Barney, this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia.",48,26415
"06","09","Robin ","Okay, guys, come on. It's a kids' show! Like Electric Company or Sesame Street or, um...",49,26416
"06","09","Marshall ","You can't do that on television.",50,26417
"06","09","Robin ","Exactly.",51,26418
"06","09","Marshall ","No. You can't do that on television!",52,26419
"06","09","Ted ","Robin, this show is so dirty, I don't know whether to hug you or run a shower for you so you can sit there alone, crying and clenching your knees.",53,26420
"06","09","Robin ","It's just bad camera work, okay? Wayne, our camera guy... he wasn't that great.",54,26421
"06","09","Marshall ","I don't know. I think he did a pretty good job, considering he was probably only using one hand.",55,26422
"06","09","Robin ","You know what? I feel bad for you Americans, that you can look at this wondrous and educational adventure through space, and see something obscene. Can you just please try to look at this with the innocence of a child?",56,26423
"06","09","Man ","Coming up. Here we go. Girls, if you want to get through the asteroid belt, you've got to use multiplication. To the joystick! Okay, Space Teens, let's multiply! Five times six?",57,26424
"06","09","Robin Sparkles"," Oh. 30.",58,26425
"06","09","Man ","Yes! Oh! Seven times four?",59,26426
"06","09","Jessica Glitter"," 28!",60,26427
"06","09","Man ","Keep going! Eight times nine?",61,26428
"06","09","Jessica Glitter"," 72!",62,26429
"06","09","Man ","Don't stop now! Almost there! 23 times three?",63,26430
"06","09","Barney ","I'm sorry. We got to ration this. It's like we're on a desert island, and this video is a really hot, naked chick, and she's got, like, seaweed on her and a seashell bra. You all feel me?",64,26431
"06","09","Lily ","Hey, if you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her?",65,26432
"06","09","Robin ","Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card from her every year, but we're not really friends anymore.",66,26433
"06","09","Lily ","But BFFs are forever.",67,26434
"06","09","Marshall ","Oh, come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends with their high school friends.",68,26435
"06","09","Ted ","I'm still friends with Punchy.",69,26436
"06","09","Marshall ","Dude, he lives in Cleveland. You see him once a year, at which point, he punches you really hard in the arm and tells everyone how you dookied your pants. I know, on paper he sounds great, but you guys aren't really friends.",70,26437
"06","09","Ted ","Look, I may not see him a lot, but it doesn't matter. Observe.",71,26438
"06","09","Punchy ","Schmosby!",72,26439

"06","09","Ted ","Yeah, you, too. If you're ever in New York.",75,26442
"06","09","Punchy ","Definitely.",76,26443
"06","09","Ted ","We are just two peas.",77,26444
"06","09","Lily ","I don't get it. How can you and Glitter just stop being friends? Best friends don't do that.",78,26445
"06","09","Robin ","Well, we did, okay? And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it. I got to go.",79,26446
"06","09","Lily ","Whoa. What do you think came between Robin and Jessica?",80,26447
"06","09","Ted ","Much like our friends, the Space Teens, I think I can solve this crime with math. Okay... Okay, here is a Christmas card that Jessica sent Robin. Lily, how old would you say that kid is?",81,26448
"06","09","Lily ","Four years, three months.",82,26449
"06","09","Ted ","Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago. Right around the time she and Robin stopped being friends.",83,26450
"06","09","Marshall ","Of course. Robin hates kids.",84,26451
"06","09","Barney ","The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat.",85,26452
"06","09","Ted ","Thus, if I may... When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear, Robin said, ""To hell with this, I'm outta hare. Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her.",86,26453
"06","09","Marshall ","That's got to be it, right, Lil? Lil?",87,26454
"06","09","Lily ","Robin's gonna dump me!",88,26455
"06","09","Marshall ","Oh, sweetheart.",89,26456
"06","09","Ted ","When a second uterus plumped becomes...",90,26457
"06","09","Marshall ","Dude. Feel the room.",91,26458
"06","09","Robin ","No.",92,26459
"06","09","Ted ","We've been waiting all day!",93,26460
"06","09","Robin ","Just watch it without me.",94,26461
"06","09","Barney ","Two dudes on the couch together watching p*rn? That's kind of weird.",95,26462
"06","09","Robin ","Okay, it's not p*rn, it's a kids' show.",96,26463
"06","09","Ted ","Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse.",97,26464
"06","09","Robin ","Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off.",98,26465
"06","09","Barney ","We...",99,26466
"06","09","Robin ","I'm serious.",100,26467
"06","09","Robin Sparkles"," Hey Jessica, how's your beaver?",101,26468
"06","09","Jessica Glitter"," Great. How's your beaver?",102,26469
"06","09","Robin Sparkles"," Busy as ever!",103,26470
"06","09","Robin ","Our characters had pet beavers.",104,26471
"06","09","Ted ","Sure.",105,26472
"06","09","Robin ","The beaver is the official animal of Canada. It's our national mascot.",106,26473
"06","09","Barney ","It's a noble creature.",107,26474
"06","09","Man ","Okay, girls. Everyone knows a beaver's favorite food is wood. I just hope we brought along enough of it for our three-day galactic space journey. So let's do the math. If Robin's beaver devours six inches of wood every half hour, and Jessica's beaver devours eight inches of wood every 45 minutes, how much wood will I need to keep both of these beavers well-fed all weekend long? While you figure it out at home, how about we sing you a song about our beavers?",108,26475
"06","09","Robin ","Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable!",109,26476
"06","09","Barney ","No arguments here.",110,26477
"06","09","Punchy ","'Sup Shmosby!",111,26478
"06","09","Ted ","Punchy, what are you doing here?",112,26479
"06","09","Punchy ","Well, yesterday you said if I was ever in New York. 'Sup, turds?",113,26480

"06","09","Punchy ","I know! It's so good, right? Feel like you're dreaming? But check your totem, brah. Punchy's here in the flesh. So, why don't we get one of these, Ted? Yeah. Remember these? High school? Junior high? Yeah. Elementary school? Remember those?",117,26484
"06","09","Punchy ","Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied in your pants down by the lake? Unbelievable!",118,26485
"06","09","Robin ","Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied on our couch in the form of your idiot high school friend? Unbelievable!",119,26486
"06","09","Ted ","Come on. I worry about the guy. He's had the same dead-end job at a car rental place for 15 years.",120,26487
"06","09","Robin ","Don't care.",121,26488
"06","09","Ted ","He's been stuck in Cleveland his whole life.",122,26489

"06","09","Robin ","Oh, a Korean massage.",127,26494
"06","09","Lily ","By yourself?",128,26495
"06","09","Robin ","Well, I figured you'd be busy, reading What to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect.",129,26496
"06","09","Lily ","Guys, did you see that? She's going to a Korean massage without me. That's our thing. I'm telling you, she's gonna dump me, just like she dumped Glitter.",130,26497

"06","09","Ted ","Um, hello, somebody already solved that crime using math, remember?",132,26499
"06","09","Marshall ","Look, Lily. Robin is clearly getting tired of you constantly talking about babies.",133,26500

"06","09","Marshall ","Okay. So before you Lily all over the place, maybe you should try hanging out with Robin and not talking about babies.",138,26505
"06","09",NA,"Ted from 2030: So Lily did just that. She tried not to talk about babies.",139,26506
"06","09","Robin ","Hey, Lily, what brings you to the crib?",140,26507
"06","09","Lily ","Crib...",141,26508
"06","09","Robin ","What's the matter? You look rattled.",142,26509
"06","09","Lily ","Rattled? I want to talk about babies.",143,26510
"06","09","Robin ","What?",144,26511
"06","09","Lily ","Look, I know you don't care about this stuff, but I'm about to become a mother. And as a future mother, I'm gonna need the support...",145,26512
"06","09","Robin ","Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet.",146,26513
"06","09","Lily ","What's that supposed to mean?",147,26514
"06","09","Robin ","It means that a fertilized egg has not yet attached itself to the lining of your uterine wall. You see? I read your Facebook updates. God, it's like it's all you ever talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it!",148,26515
"06","09","Lily ","Well, guess what? I've got some good news. When that baby comes, you don't have to see it. In fact, you don't have to see me. This whole friendship thing? Done.",149,26516
"06","09","Robin ","Great.",150,26517

"06","09","Marshall ","Get on the phone, call Robin and fix this.",156,26523
"06","09","Lily ","I can't. The damage is done. Can you just hold me?",157,26524

"06","09","Marshall ","Okay. Maybe just one cuddle, but then that is it.",160,26527
"06","09","Punchy ","Times Square's the b*mb! I got so many great pictures of all the billboards.",161,26528
"06","09","Ted ","Yeah. You know, there's more to New York than Times Square. There's the Village, the Lower East Side, Central Park...",162,26529
"06","09","Punchy ","They got better billboards then the ones in Times Square?",163,26530
"06","09","Ted ","No.",164,26531

"06","09","Punchy ","I'm going to go pee in the jar I got going in the alley.",167,26534
"06","09","Barney ","Seriously, dude, he has got to go. You need to be like, ""You are the weakest link. Goodbye."" Punchy, the tribe has spoken. Please pack up your knives and go. Your work of art didn't work for us. Your time's up. I have to ask you to leave the mansion. You must leave the chateau. Your tour ends here. You've been chopped.",168,26535
"06","09","Ted ","Okay, yeah. I know.",169,26536
"06","09","Barney ","You've been evicted from the Big Brother house. Your dessert just didn't measure up. Sashay away. Give me your jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen. I'm sorry, you did not get a rose. You have been eliminated from the race. You are no longer in the running to be America's Next Top Model. You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen.",170,26537
"06","09","Punchy ","Ted, come look at this. I found a little wounded bird in the alley.",171,26538

"06","09","Marshall ","Okay, you refused to talk to Robin. So I thought that you might like to talk to... the organist for the New York Rangers. Jessica Glitter?!",176,26543
"06","09","Lily ","How did you find Glitter?",177,26544
"06","09","Marshall ","Simple, really. I used my powers of deduction. You see, I knew Glitter used to be a keytarist, which is basically a piano, so I just made a list of all the keyboard-based occupations and then I cross-matched them...",178,26545
"06","09","Jessica Glitter"," His friend Barney looked me up, hoping to buy my Space Teens costume.",179,26546
"06","09","Marshall ","Yo, Glitter... Be cool.",180,26547
"06","09","Jessica Glitter"," So, is this the one who's best friends with Robin now?",181,26548
"06","09","Lily ","More like ex-best friends. Just like you.",182,26549
"06","09","Jessica Glitter"," I'm sorry to hear that. I miss Robin.",183,26550
"06","09","Lily ","Yeah, well, Marshall and I are about to get pregnant, and I know she stopped being friends with you when you had a baby, so...",184,26551
"06","09","Jessica Glitter"," Oh, Robin didn't stop being friends with me. I stopped being friends with her.",185,26552
"06","09","Lily ","What? Why?",186,26553
"06","09","Jessica Glitter"," Because I had a baby. Honey, when you have a baby, all that best friend stuff-- hockey, bow hunting for caribou, math...that all goes out the window. I mean, I tried to stay friends with her, but it just didn't happen. She took it pretty hard. I even thought she might try to k*ll herself.",187,26554
"06","09","Marshall ","Charge!",188,26555
"06","09","Lily ","Wow. You dumped her just because you had a baby? That's cold.",189,26556
"06","09","Jessica Glitter"," Didn't you do the same thing? Minus the baby?",190,26557
"06","09","Lily ","Oh, God. I gotta go. I gotta go apologize to Robin. I- I need to tell her I love her, and that she'll always be a priority.",191,26558
"06","09","Jessica Glitter"," Be careful, Lily. I made those promises, too. And now I haven't even talked to her in five years. Sure, I thought about picking up the phone and calling her a hundred times, but I just never have the courage to actually...(Marshall is playing the piano) Hey. Go ahead.",192,26559

"06","09","Ted ","Uh, no. Back-Back to Cleveland.",196,26563
"06","09","Punchy ","I don't know if I can do that, bro. I mean, yeah, I've been jonesing for a piece of Cleveland-style pizza, but I feel bad about leaving you out here. I worry about you, Ted.",197,26564
"06","09","Ted ","You worry about me?",198,26565
"06","09","Punchy ","Yeah. The other day, when you called...",199,26566
"06","09","Punchy ","Schmosby!",200,26567

"06","09","Punchy ","Yeah. He's not doing so good. Poor guy lives in a tiny apartment in New York, nowhere near Times Square. He's got no family around. He's still single, doesn't have a backyard. It's just a bummer.",208,26575
"06","09","Woman ","Maybe you should go visit him. Cheer him up a little. You know, buy him some shots, do the whole wounded bird trick.",209,26576
"06","09","Punchy ","You think that would work?",210,26577
"06","09","Woman ","Worked on me.",211,26578

"06","10","Ted ","Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes as good as it looks.",238,26841
"06","10",NA,"Ted from 2030: It didn't. It tasted wrong.",239,26842
"06","10","Steve ","Oops. We forgot to light the candles.",240,26843
"06","10",NA,"Ted from 2030: And just as Barney looked away, it happened.",241,26844
"06","10","Everyone ","The Gentleman!",242,26845
"06","10","Barney ","What happened? I saw it!",243,26846
"06","10","Steve ","Aw, come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad. Aw, man. Oh, go ahead. I forgot my jacket.",244,26847
"06","10","Woman ","Oh, hold the door!",245,26848
"06","10","Barney ","Thank you, God!",246,26849

"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: Kids, in the winter of 2010, we had a new addition to our little group... Zoey. Zoey was married to... The Captain.",1,26851
"06","11","Captain ","Boys! Great to see you! Looking smart. Have a wonderful time tonight, okay?",2,26852
"06","11","Marshall ","Okay. That man is terrifying.",3,26853
"06","11","Barney ","Everything he said was nice, but I am profoundly scared.",4,26854
"06","11","Ted ","Keep smiling. He can still see us.",5,26855
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: There was just something about him. We couldn't put our finger on it until...",6,26856
"06","11","Marshall ","I figured it out! I know what's so creepy about The Captain.",7,26857
"06","11","Robin ","Okay.",8,26858
"06","11","Marshall ","Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey.Observe. The bottom half of his face... is smiling. He seems happy. Seems like a nice guy. (everyone is murmuring happily) But the top half of his face...wants to m*rder you! Cheerful. Wants to m*rder you. No. Cheerful. Wants to m*rder you. Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question. Captain, what do you think of ice cream? Oh, he loves it!",9,26859
"06","11","Barney ","Captain, what do you think of rainy days?",10,26860
"06","11","Marshall ","Whoa, he hates them.",11,26861
"06","11","Robin ","Captain, quick question: How do you feel about the Jonas Brothers? Ooh.",12,26862
"06","11","Ted ","Ooh. What-What is that?",13,26863
"06","11","Robin and Lily"," I don't get it.",14,26864
"06","11","Marshall ","He hates that he loves them.",15,26865
"06","11","Ted ","Great. Okay. Hey, guys, Zoey just told me about this great Frank Lloyd Wright retrospective tonight. Who's in?",16,26866
"06","11","Lily ","Sorry, I'm, uh, I... I- I don't know, washing my hair.",17,26867
"06","11","Marshall ","Running the water.",18,26868
"06","11","Robin ","Holding the towel.",19,26869
"06","11","Barney ","And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited meto the big hair washing party.",20,26870
"06","11","Ted ","All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.",21,26871
"06","11","Lily ","Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one...",22,26872
"06","11","Barney ","Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude.",23,26873
"06","11","Lily ","Rule number one: don't go anywhere that has candles.",24,26874
"06","11","Marshall ","Excuse me, Captain, how do you feel about Ted and Zoey having an intimate chat by candlelight? It'll be the last dinner they ever have.",25,26875
"06","11","Lily ","Rule number two: No sharing food. In fact, anything involving saliva is off-limits. Toothbrushes, thermometers, lipstick.",26,26876
"06","11","Ted ","Well, if I can't share her lipstick,there's really no pointin even going.",27,26877
"06","11","Lily ","And the most important rule of all...",28,26878
"06","11","Barney ","Lubricant is public property. (Robin groans)",29,26879
"06","11","Marshall ","Please.",30,26880
"06","11","Lily ","No lying to the spouse about anything you do.",31,26881
"06","11","Ted ","Why would anyone lie? Look, Zoey and I are just friends. If there was anything more than that, I wouldn't hang out with her.",32,26882
"06","11","Marshall ","Lily's right, Ted. Once you're married, it's very hard to be friends with a single person of the opposite s*x.",33,26883
"06","11","Robin ","Yeah. Unless you're old friends, which is why I can hang out with Marshall whenever I want. Right, Marsh Madness?",34,26884
"06","11","Marshall ","No doubt, Robo Cop.",35,26885

"06","11","Lily ","Oh! Sweet. No candles.",39,26889
"06","11","Barney ","Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. Want to hang?",40,26890
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: And then Lily said something to Barney that insulted every fiber of his being.",41,26891
"06","11","Lily ","Nah.",42,26892
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: Wait. No. It had to be more than just, ""Nah."" Oh, I think she said...",43,26893
"06","11","Lily ","You're a big... stupid octopus head!",44,26894
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: No, that doesn't make sense. Okay, hang on. What did she say? She said, um, uh... To be honest kids, I'm having a little trouble remembering exactly what their fight was about. Hey, it was 20 years ago! I'll remember. Anyway, the next night...",45,26895
"06","11","Ted ","Well, Lily, you were right. Something weird happened with Zoey last night.",46,26896
"06","11","Zoey ","Oh, that's the Captain. Yes, I call my husband The Captain, but that is the only concession I make to his seafaring ways. Hang on. Ahoy. I'm just out with friends.",47,26897
"06","11","Ted ","Friends. Plural. Like-Like there was more than one of me.",48,26898
"06","11","Lily ","Ew! Ew! She lied to her husband? Uh-oh. So, what did you do?",49,26899
"06","11","Ted ","Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say you were out with friends?",50,26900
"06","11","Zoey ","Yeah. The Captain's on his way home from Milan. He can get a little jealous sometimes, so I didn't want to make him worry. Is that okay?",51,26901
"06","11","Ted ","It's totally okay.",52,26902
"06","11","Lily ","It's not okay! I didn't really think it was okay! Pur-leez! You lie to your husband all the time. ""Uh, uh, that shirt looks great on you""""I love your mom""""I never fantasize about Barney when we're doing it"""" Sound familiar, Pinocchio?",53,26903
"06","11","Marshall ","What's wrong with this shirt?",54,26904
"06","11","Ted ","Lily, ruling. Do I have to stop hanging out with Zoey?",55,26905
"06","11","Lily ","No, you just need to spend time with her and The Captain together. If you're friends with the both of them, then there's not a problem.",56,26906
"06","11","Ted ","Actually, I do have a standing invitation from The Captain to go for a ride with them on his boat.",57,26907
"06","11","Lily ","Great. So go make nice with Captain Creepy, and problem solved.",58,26908
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: The next night, Marshall and Robin went to dinner, just the two of them. Now historically, they had three solid conversation topics: cold weather...",59,26909

"06","11","Marshall ","Totally.",61,26911
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030:...sports...",62,26912
"06","11","Marshall ","Did you catch the game last night?",63,26913
"06","11","Robin ","Yeah. Nail-biter.",64,26914

"06","11","Marshall ","You know what's fun? Is cold weather sports.",66,26916
"06","11","Robin ","They are fun.",67,26917
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: They blew through them all in the first 16 seconds.",68,26918
"06","11","Robin ","Man, this is awkward.",69,26919
"06","11","Marshall ","She's giving me nothing! He's just staring at me! She's just staring at me! It's making me nervous. Great, now my left eye is twitching.",70,26920
"06","11","Robin ","Marshall, it's cool. She doesn't see it. What the hell's going on with his eye? Am I supposed to not talk about that? Great, now my right eye is doing it.",71,26921
"06","11","Waiter ","Can I get you two some drinks?",72,26922
"06","11","Marshall ","Lots of drinks.",73,26923
"06","11","Robin ","Oh, so many drinks.",74,26924
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: That same night, Barney and Lily were still fighting about, um... something. Or was it that other thing?",75,26925
"06","11","Lily ","Barney.",76,26926
"06","11","Barney ","Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for... something, and for that other thing.",77,26927
"06","11","Lily ","Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But let's be honest. You've been super sensitive lately.",78,26928
"06","11",NA,"Barney, crying: No, I haven't! God, how can you say that?!",79,26929
"06","11","Lily ","Watch out!",80,26930
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: Wait. They were on the street.",81,26931
"06","11","Lily ","Watch out!",82,26932
"06","11","Barney ","Oh! Wow. Thanks, Lily. You saved me. You saved us. Look, I know you didn't mean whatever it was you said that made me so mad.",83,26933
"06","11","Lily ","I think I probably didn't.",84,26934
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: And just like that, the fight was over. You know, kids, friendship is funny sometimes.",85,26935
"06","11","Lily ","Wait. I still can't resist getting one last shot in.",86,26936
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: Like I said, the fight was just getting started.",87,26937
"06","11","Ted ","Hi, Captain. The Captain. Captain.",88,26938
"06","11","Captain ","Ahoy, Ted! Excellent to see you.",89,26939
"06","11","Ted ","Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey?",90,26940
"06","11","Captain ","Well, I'm afraid she's feeling a little under the weather. Looks like it's just you, me and six hours in frigid international waters.",91,26941
"06","11","Ted ","Or we could stay on dry land, hang out with some... witnesses.",92,26942
"06","11","Captain ","You're a hoot. I've been looking forward to this. For a very long time. Well, anchors aweigh!",93,26943
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: Kids, here's one thing I do remember. I was pretty sure I was going to die that night.",94,26944
"06","11","Robin ","You know, I had this really boring poetry class in college.",95,26945
"06","11","Marshall ","You were just thinking that this dinner is really boring. That's what made you think of your boring class in college.",96,26946
"06","11","Robin ","What?! What? No! No! No, no, no. Marshall, no. No. I... I just saw that board of specials, and I thought, you know what sucks? Being bored. Which I am not. So that clears that... right up.",97,26947
"06","11","Marshall ","Robin, I'm an attorney.",98,26948
"06","11","Robin ","Fine. This night's a little awkward.",99,26949
"06","11","Marshall ","I guess it's 'cause we never hang out alone together.",100,26950
"06","11","Robin ","Why is that?",101,26951
"06","11","Marshall ","It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory.",102,26952
"06","11","Marshall ","Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB.",103,26953
"06","11","Barney ","So, who's the eye broccoli?",104,26954
"06","11","Marshall ","Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good.",105,26955
"06","11","Barney ","Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs.",106,26956
"06","11","Marshall ","I don't think that's gonna be a problem.",107,26957
"06","11","Barney ","Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be?",108,26958
"06","11","Marshall ","I'm sorry. Myth?",109,26959
"06","11","Barney ","It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like... beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now.",110,26960
"06","11","Marshall ","And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually...",111,26961
"06","11","Barney ","D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks.",112,26962
"06","11","Marshall ","Did we bet on this?",113,26963
"06","11","Barney ","Let's say yes.",114,26964
"06","11","Robin ","And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes.",115,26965
"06","11","Marshall ","As Lily's best friend, you are the last person on the planet o's allowed to turn into a mermaid.",116,26966
"06","11","Robin ","Wait, does that mean that I'm a manatee right now?",117,26967
"06","11","Marshall ","Big-time manatee.",118,26968
"06","11","Robin ","What were those sailors thinking?",119,26969
"06","11","Marshall ","Huh. I don't know. Being out at sea can do crazy things to a man.",120,26970
"06","11","Captain ","Vast, the sea. Deep. Endless. Going around for miles. You could scream and scream, and not a soul would hear you. Listen to this. (screams) Help! Somebody help me! I'm trapped on a boat with a madman! Help! See? Nothing.",121,26971
"06","11","Ted ","He's gonna k*ll me. Okay, calm down, Teddy. He's not jealous. He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.",122,26972
"06","11","Captain ","So, Ted, I noticed you've been spending a lot of time with Zoey.",123,26973
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: Okay, back to Barney and Lily and whatever the hell they were fighting about.",124,26974
"06","11","Lily ","Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there.",125,26975
"06","11","Barney ","What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face!",126,26976
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: Wait. Barney's not a woman. That's right... Barney wasn't hurt by Lily, Lily was hurt by Barney.",127,26977
"06","11","Lily ","Want to hang?",128,26978
"06","11","Barney ","Nah. Watch out!",129,26979
"06","11","Lily ","Wow... thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us.",130,26980
"06","11","Lily ","If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!",131,26981
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: Okay, now I'm on track. The rest of this story should make perfect sense.",132,26982
"06","11","Barney ","Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",133,26983
"06","11","Lily ","You're a jerk.",134,26984
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: Okay, that makes no sense. Kids, I'm officially admitting defeat. I will never remember this story. I'm sorry for wasting your time.",135,26985
"06","11","Captain ","Ted, let me show you my harpoon collection.",136,26986
"06","11","Ted ","Just gonna make a quick call. Hey, silly question. What are our exact nautical coordinates?",137,26987
"06","11","Captain ","How now? Oh, bother. (sighs) Well... she's a goner. By now, the icy tide has already dropped its core temperature to near freezing. And down it goes. Now it's at 50 meters. Complete crushing blackness. 100 meters. The pressure is so intense, the keys are popping right out of its head.",138,26988
"06","11","Ted ","Head?",139,26989
"06","11","Captain ","200 meters. No one will ever find its mangled remains, save for the crustacea that feed off its lifeless husk. Can you hear me now? No. Because you're on the bottom of the sea.",140,26990
"06","11","Ted ","Well, I got a big morning, so... Dry cleaners, bank, you know, so...",141,26991
"06","11","Captain ","Ted, it's time. I have something for you. Wait here.",142,26992
"06","11",NA,"Ted:: Okay, you got to swim for it, Mosby. Man versus sea. You can do this. You didn't get a ""Good Effort"" ribbon from the Shaker Heights JCC Swim Camp because you don't have what it takes.",143,26993
"06","11","Captain ","Found it. Zoey told me you're a scotch drinker. I bought this special for tonight.",144,26994
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030:And just as I started to realize that maybe I wasn't in danger after all, we hit a bump.",145,26995
"06","11","Captain ","Ted?",146,26996
"06","11","Robin ","you're afraid that if you spend too much time alone with me, I'll turn into a mermaid?",147,26997
"06","11","Marshall ","Yes. I mean, sure, right now, you're bald and leathery ancovered in a thick layer of blubber...",148,26998
"06","11","Robin ","Am I blushing or...?",149,26999
"06","11",NA,"Marshall:...but at some point, my stupid male brain will transform you into a foxy fish-babe singin' ""Part of Your World"" to my pants.",150,27000
"06","11","Robin ","Okay, even if that happens, is there any way to un-mermaid me?",151,27001
"06","11","Marshall ","I asked Barney the same thing.",152,27002
"06","11","Barney ","Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome.",153,27003
"06","11","Marshall ","Death?",154,27004
"06","11","Barney ","Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City... where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty.",155,27005
"06","11","Robin ","Pregnancy?",156,27006
"06","11","Marshall ","Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant, she becomes a manatee again. Never thought I'd say that sentence.",157,27007
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: Wait! That's it! That's what Barney and Lily were fighting about! The Mermaid Theory! But their argument didn't happen at the same time as all this other stuff. I'm literally in the wrong year! It happened much, much later when Lily was... pregnant.",158,27008
"06","11","Barney ","Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang?",159,27009
"06","11","Liy ","Nah. Whenever we're alone, you spend the whole time undressing me with your eyes. You even take off my shoes.",160,27010
"06","11","Barney ","High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee.",161,27011
"06","11","Lily ","Well, you're a big... stupid octopus face!",162,27012
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: That was it! I remember now!",163,27013
"06","11","Lily ","Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman ""fat"" right to her face!",164,27014
"06","11","Barney ","I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",165,27015
"06","11","Lily ","Oh... You're a jerk.",166,27016
"06","11","Barney ","Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act.",167,27017
"06","11",NA,"Lily:What's that?",168,27018
"06","11","Barney ","Breast-feeding. Hot.",169,27019

"06","11","Ted ","Okay, now we're even!",174,27024
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: Yeah, that's the ending to a whole other story. We'll get there.",175,27025
"06","11","Captain ","So you really thought I was gonna k*ll you?",176,27026
"06","11","Ted ","Well... ish.",177,27027
"06","11","Captain ","Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous. If I wanted to k*ll you, I'd invite you to my hunting lodge. It's far more remote, and I wouldn't have to worry about you turning up in some nosy fisherman's net.",178,27028
"06","11","Ted ","See? It's stuff like that. Why-why do you talk that way?",179,27029
"06","11","Captain ","Oh, I'm just jesting for sport. See, sometimes I don't bond as well with Zoey's younger friends. But I know she really likes you. I was hoping that maybe we could be buddies.",180,27030
"06","11","Ted ","We can. We can be buddies. Just not on a boat.",181,27031

"06","11","Marshall ","Yeah, me, too.",184,27034
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: And then a terrible thing happened. Marshall's beer goggles kicked in and his very drunk mind started to see...",185,27035

"06","11","Robin ","Uh-oh. I don't feel so good. (She vomits) Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry! Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting.",187,27037
"06","11","Marshall ","I really do.",188,27038
"06","11",NA,"Ted from 2030: And from that moment on Marshall never worried about Robin becoming a mermaid again, and the two of them were closer than ever.",189,27039
"06","11","Zoey ","Hey, Ted.",190,27040
"06","11","Ted ","Hey. You feeling better?",191,27041
"06","11","Zoey ","I have a confession to make. I wasn't really sick.",192,27042
"06","11","Ted ","You weren't?",193,27043

"06","13","Lily ","Uh-uh, no. Can't do it.",44,27322

"06","13","Barney ","Problem?! You can't get a girl pregnant. That's the dream. I'd give my firstborn to not be able to have children.",89,27367

"06","13","Barney ","Exactly! Or when your... I don't know... friend invites you to a laser tag tournament, you don't fight it. You just strap on the vinyl holster and race into that abandoned JCPenney g*ns a-blazin'. I'm just agreeing with Ted.",108,27386

"06","14","Marshall ","You guys don't get it, okay? None of you do. My dad was my hero. And he was my teacher. And he was my best friend. He always came through for me. And now he's just gone. And what am I left with? (scratchy electronic sounds) Thanks a lot, God! Thank you! You took my father, the greatest man that I have ever known, and you ripped him off this Earth, way too young! And he'll never get to meet our kids, Lily. (scratchy sounds continue) But we got this voice mail. Thank you so much for the voice mail! It's a great comfort! 'Cause whenever I'm starting to feel lonely or sad, or-- or you know what, or maybe a little bit cheated, at least I got the sound of his pocket to console me. How is this fair? You know, like, an entire human life and it just ends for no reason, and... and what are we left with?",181,27682

"06","15","Robin ","Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now, too. It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her. She'll always be around.",96,27801
"06","15","Ted ","Then what am I supposed to do?",97,27802
"06","15","Robin ","Okay, just shut it down. Okay, just ignore your feelings. If-If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self. Look, I like Zoey. Without her, my dinner party wouldn't have been such a success. So those feelings of yours... shut 'em down.",98,27803

"06","15","Marshall ","Hey, uh, so Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing.",109,27814

"06","15","Zoey ","Wait, she didn't go home with Ted?",131,27836
"06","15","Barney ","Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize... (imitating squeaky bedsprings)",132,27837

"06","15","Marcus ","Wait, hear me out, Marshall. Zoey's in love with Ted, but she's married, so she tried to push him away by setting him up with her cousin instead. But seeing Ted and Honey hit it off was more than her gentle heart could bear, so Zoey left early, pricked by love's fickle thorn. But then, the next morning, upon learning that Ted had not tasted of Honey's sweet nectar, her joy burst forth like a blossoming flower in spring.",136,27841
"06","15","Marshall ","Wow. Zoey's in love with Ted.",137,27842

"06","15","Honey ","I guess he recently decided to get in touch with his dad. His mom gave him the guy's address.",201,27906
"06","15","Barney ","So I wrote him a letter. And I poured my heart out. And I gave him my number and I told him to call me. And he still hasn't called me.",202,27907
"06","15","Honey ","Oh, honey.",203,27908
"06","15","Barney ","I mean, I shouldn't be surprised. Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me.",204,27909
"06","15","Honey ","Oh, honey.",205,27910
"06","15","Barney ","I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son.",206,27911
"06","15","Honey ","Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you. He's ashamed of himself. I mean, look at you. You're do so great without him. I mean, you have an airline and three Nobel Prizes, and you play for the Yankees.",207,27912
"06","15","Barney ","Four. Four Nobel Prizes.",208,27913

"06","15","Ted ","All right. Yes. I... hate you.",220,27925
"06","15","Zoey ","Great. See? Was that so hard?",221,27926
"06","15","Ted ","Zoey.",222,27927
"06","15","Zoey ","Can you at least tell me why? Because I'm racking my brain here, and I thought... I just want to know why.",223,27928
"06","15","Marshall ","So we got Ted and Zoey. Ted is in love with Zoey. Zoey has no idea. Then Zoey's cousin Honey went home with Barney, and Zoey was happy about it. Which tells us what?",224,27929
"06","15","Marcus ","Zoey's in love with...",225,27930
"06","15","Marshall ","Zoey's in love with Ted and Ted doesn't know. So Ted and Zoey... they're in love with each other, which would be fine if Zoey wasn't married to Colonel Mustard. I mean, The Captain. Except now, as Honey informs me...",226,27931
"06","15","Ted ","And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.",227,27932
"06","15","Zoey ","Fine, I will, uh, make it happen. Good-bye. Okay. Well... I guess I'll take it.",228,27933
"06","15","Marshall ","Zoey and The Captain are getting divorced. Which means...?",229,27934

"06","16","Robin "," Guys booty-call girls after 2:00 a.m. with a drunkenly slurred, ""What ya doing?"" But when a lady booty-calls a guy, she invents a respectable excuse to mask the fact that she wants to get stuck real good.",12,27959
"06","16","Lily ","It's called class, Ted.",13,27960
"06","16","Ted ","Wait. That... You think that's what she means by ""baking cookies""?",14,27961
"06","16","Lily ","Are you kidding? You're in the kitchen, it's getting hot, you start licking stuff off each others' fingers.

"06","16","Robin "," That's not a thing.",27,27974
"06","16","Barney "," It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death.",28,27975
"06","16","Ted ","That's actually true.",29,27976

"06","16","Robin "," Please say ""widows.""",38,27985

"06","16","Lily ","I wanted to surprise you.",66,28013
"06","16","Marshall ","Oh, my gosh. That's so sweet. I'm so glad you're here. Hey, um, before I forget, Mom, did you remember to get more double-A batteries?",67,28014
"06","16","Judy ","Oh, they're upstairs, sweetie. Right next to your washed and folded clothes.",68,28015
"06","16","Marshall ","Oh, great, okay. I don't want my Game Boy to crap out. I'm having the sickest Dr. Mario run of my life. Okay. I'll be right back. I love you, Lily. Okay. You're the best, Mom.",69,28016

"06","16","Lily ","I thought he was here helping you.",71,28018
"06","16","Judy ","Well, he was, at first. But once he saw me starting to do better, he kind of regressed. He's been holed up in his room for days at a time, playing old video games. I mean, he is having a pretty sick Dr. Mario run, but...",72,28019
"06","16","Lily ","Uh, I'll talk to him.",73,28020
"06","16","Judy ","I want to be there for him, but it's like he's a teenager again. I even walked in on him abusing himself.",74,28021
"06","16","Lily ","Oh, God.",75,28022
"06","16","Judy ","There he was, on the bed, looking at old photos of his dad. That's emotional self-abuse, don't you think?",76,28023
"06","16","Ted ","Listen, that was a dumb move for me to just assume...",77,28024
"06","16","Zoey ","No, no, I overreacted. I mean, I invited you over to ""bake cookies."" We both knew what that meant.",78,28025
"06","16","Ted ","We totally did.",79,28026
"06","16","Zoey ","I just, you know... I saw those slippers in your bag, and suddenly everything felt really serious. And... ever since, I've been asking myself, ""Am I ready for this?"" And... the answer is ""yes.""",80,28027

And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything.",162,28109
"06","16","Barney "," All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13... a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate.",163,28110
"06","16","Nora ","What's desperate about knowing what you want? Look, life is really short, Barney. Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone, distracting yourself from the fact that nobody loves you with some sad little activity?",164,28111
"06","16","Barney "," Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie.",165,28112

"06","16","Ted ","Things with Zoey are moving really fast, and the divorce just makes everything more complicated. I just, I needed to take a step back.",174,28121
"06","16","Marshall ","You're not taking a step back. You're running away. And hiding out here, hiding out here is not gonna solve anything. You're just holed up in Minnesota because you're too scared to face reality, and it's... We got to go back to New York, tonight.",175,28122
"06","16","Ted ","We're snowed in. Lily got the last flight.",176,28123

"06","16","Anna ","Those guys are gonna buy us hot dogs at Grey's Papaya.",188,28135
"06","16","Robin "," What...? So that's it? A couple of white Urkels offer you sausages, and you're gone? What about the sisterhood? Solidarity? The color purple?",189,28136
"06","16","Bev ","But tomorrow's Valentine's Day.",190,28137

"06","16","Barney "," What are you talking about?",198,28145

"06","17","Ted ","To the study?",153,28319
"06","17","Captain ","To the study! Mmm. Ted... I know.",154,28320
"06","17","Ted ","Know what?",155,28321
"06","17","Captain ","I know who stole my Zoey. No man likes to be betrayed, especially by a friend. You can imagine then how painful it was when I learned that the name of my betrayer is... Ted... when I tell you who it is, you're gonna... It's my doorman!",156,28322
"06","17","Ted ","That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?",157,28323
"06","17","Captain ","He always winks and tips his hat when he sees her. I know how these things work. He holds her package, and pretty soon, she's holding his. And then there's his glorious mustache. I will have him fired for this!",158,28324
"06","17","Ted ","No, no, no, you can't fire him.",159,28325
"06","17","Captain ","You're right. Maritime protocol demands physical retribution!",160,28326
"06","17","Ted ","Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop!",161,28327
"06","17","Captain ","Who is this flower child, and what has he done with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?!",162,28328
"06","17","Ted ","Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!",163,28329
"06","17","Captain ","Whoa, ""rapscallion"" may be going a bit far, Ted.",164,28330
"06","17","Ted ","But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that.",165,28331
"06","17","Captain ","Why couldn't she just like boats? Just to have one thing in common? Other girls like boats, don't they?",166,28332
"06","17","Ted ","Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey.",167,28333
"06","17","Captain ","When you put it that way, I should almost thank the doorman.",168,28334
"06","17","Ted ","Yeah, yeah! And, you know, since, since it doesn't really matter who Zoey's dating now...",169,28335
"06","17","Captain ","It doesn't, it really doesn't. It doesn't.",170,28336
"06","17","Ted ","It's me. You're welcome.",171,28337
"06","17","Lily ","Okay, baby, what gives?",172,28338
"06","17","Marshall ","I'm sorry, but neither of us are getting any action until I find those rings.",173,28339
"06","17","Lily ","I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.",174,28340
"06","17","Barney ","All right, Robin, give it to me.",175,28341
"06","17","Robin ","Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, ""Yeah, Barney, go get her!"" But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.",176,28342
"06","17","Barney ","The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?",177,28343
"06","17","Robin ","It's a five, idiot.",178,28344
"06","17","Barney ","A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?",179,28345
"06","17","Robin ","""Moon man language""? What does that even mean?",180,28346
"06","17","Barney ","How am I supposed to see that's a five?",181,28347
"06","17","Robin ","Look how you taped this up...",182,28348
"06","17","Barney ","Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make.",183,28349
"06","17","Robin ","Barney. Go get her.",184,28350
"06","17","Ted ","Listen, Zoey, I need to ask you something. Did I steal you?",185,28351
"06","17","Zoey ","Well... yeah. You did. By being the kind of sweet, thoughtful guy who'd never even think of stealing someone, you stole me.",186,28352
"06","17","Ted ","So I'm the bad guy. Great.",187,28353
"06","17","Zoey ","Well, the story isn't over, Ted. It'll be years before we know who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. I mean, yes, divorce sucks, but sometimes things need to fall apart to make way for better things.",188,28354
"06","17","Ted ","If you say so.",189,28355
"06","17","Zoey ","I'm just saying, the eggs are already broken. Let's make sure we get a pretty good omelet out of it.",190,28356
"06","17","Lily ","Okay, Marshall, seriously, what's going on?",191,28357
"06","17","Marshall ","He'll never get to see how I turn out.",192,28358
"06","17","Lily ","What do you mean?",193,28359
"06","17","Marshall ","My dad. You know, I used to, um, I used to always tell him that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer. And he was always so proud of me for that. But he never got to see the version of me that was anything but a corporate stooge. And now it's too late. And we're starting a family, you know.",194,28360
"06","17","Lily ","Are you avoiding sleeping with me 'cause you don't want to start a family?",195,28361
"06","17","Marshall ","Lily, if we have a baby right now, that is just it for me. The cement will dry, and I will be stuck at GNB forever.",196,28362
"06","17","Lily ","Marshall, if you want to quit your job and go work for the NRDC right now, then you need to do that right now. And then, once you've cleaned up all the oceans and saved the planet... you know, like, a year from now... then we'll start a family.",197,28363
"06","17","Marshall ","I don't know. So far, in the name of saving the planet, I've ruined your night, I practically broke Wendy's back and I got Meeker fired. The guy must hate me.",198,28364
"06","17","Lily ","Meeker doesn't hate you.",199,28365
"06","17",NA,"Ted from 2030: Oh, Meeker hated him, all right. After all, Marshall was the one who got him fired. Meeker knew we all hung out at MacLaren's. So that night, he went there to confront Marshall. But as luck would have it...",200,28366
"06","17","Meeker ","Are you guys...?",201,28367
"06","17","Wendy ","Closed. Sorry. Thanks.",202,28368
"06","17","Meeker ","Rough night?",203,28369
"06","17","Wendy ","Yeah.",204,28370
"06","17","Meeker ","I'm sorry.",205,28371
"06","17","Wendy ","It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. Except for Marshall Eriksen.",206,28372
"06","17","Meeker ","What did you just say?",207,28373
"06","17","Wendy ","Uh, I said it's Marshall Eriksen's fault. Why, do you know him?",208,28374
"06","17","Meeker ","Know him? I hate that guy.",209,28375
"06","17","Wendy ","Me, too.",210,28376
"06","17","Meeker ","Well, hey.",211,28377
"06","17",NA,"Ted from 2030: And the rest, as they say...is history.",212,28378
"06","17","Wendy ","And three kids later, we decided to come here on our second honeymoon.",213,28379
"06","17","Ted ","Wow. That's a pretty good omelet.",214,28380
"06","17","Wendy ","Oh, and hey, what about you? You still with Zoey?",215,28381
"06","17","Ted ","No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well. But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids. It's actually a funny story of how we met. I was a best man at this wedding...",216,28382
"06","17","Wendy ","Listen, Ted, it's great seeing you, but we got to run.",217,28383
"06","17","Ted ","Okay, well, have a safe trip. It was great seeing you. (Ted phones Marshall) Hello. Marshall.",218,28384
"06","17","Marshall ","Hey, Ted.",219,28385
"06","17","Ted ","Hey. You will not believe who I just ran into.",220,28386
"06","18",NA,"Ted from 2030: Kids, the heart is a mysterious muscle. You never really know what's going on in there. So after Uncle Marshall lost his father, he decided to get his heart checked. And so did I... and so did Lily... and so did Robin. And then Marshall went again, just to be sure. There was only one holdout.",1,28387
"06","18","Barney ","I don't need to go to a heart doctor. I drink every day, I sleep three hours every night, and I have multiple s*x partners. I'm doing everything right.",2,28388
"06","18","Ted ","Barney, come on, this is important. We need you around for a long time. Without you, we'd have to find some other sex-fueled, depraved animal to entertain us.",3,28389
"06","18","Robin "," Actually, I'm thinking about getting a dog again.",4,28390
"06","18","Lily ","Oh, can she? Can she get a dog, please Dad?",5,28391
"06","18","Ted ","No. If you get a dog, I'm going to be the one stuck taking care of it.",6,28392
"06","18","Robin "," You wouldn't have to take care of it.",7,28393
"06","18","Ted ","Really? And who watered the philodendron on your bookcase and sang it back to life?",8,28394
"06","18","Robin "," Yeah, that was made out of silk, Ted.",9,28395
"06","18","Marshall ","Okay, Robin, what you need is indeed something that buries a bone, but I'm not talking about a dog. I'm talking about a man.",10,28396
"06","18","Robin "," Here we go.",11,28397
"06","18","Marshall ","You're clearly trying to fill a hole... in her heart. You feel like the seventh wheel, because now Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora and Lily's with Big Fudge.",12,28398
"06","18","Barney ","Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge. ""With""? I am not ""with"" Nora. Wrong preposition. Later tonight I'm hoping to be on Nora, right? Or under Nora, right? Or, we're all adults, I'll just say it... behind Nora.",13,28399
"06","18","Robin "," I don't know. This will be your second date.",14,28400
"06","18","Lily ","Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl.",15,28401
"06","18","Barney ","Yeah. pen1s feelings. Because she's hot. Guys, as you know, I only have one rule...",16,28402
"06","18",NA,"Ted from 2030: Barney said this a lot.",17,28403
"06","18","Barney ","If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day [...] Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers [...] Never date a girl with a hook for a hand [...]",18,28404
"06","18","Barney ","Never go out with the same girl more than once.",19,28405
"06","18","Lily ","Then why are you going out with Nora again?",20,28406
"06","18","Barney ","There is an exception.",21,28407
"06","18",NA,"Ted from 2030: And it was always the same exception.",22,28408
"06","18",NA,"Barney:...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot.",23,28409
"06","18","Barney ","And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it. (He sneezes)",24,28410
"06","18","Barney ","Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold.",25,28411
"06","18","Nora ","Oh, no. How long have you been sick?",26,28412
"06","18","Barney ","About 20 minutes. Can't seem to shake it.",27,28413
"06","18","Nora ","Okay, 'cause I was going to say you look a little...",28,28414
"06","18","Barney ","Handsome? Rich? Well-endowed?",29,28415
"06","18","Nora ","Huh, let's say well-endowed... with phlegm. All right, let's go. It's bedtime.",30,28416
"06","18","Barney ","The bed... that's where all the...happens.",31,28417
"06","18","Nora ","Come on, let's get you sorted out.",32,28418
"06","18",NA,"Ted from 2030: That night, Barney didn't take care of business. Instead, Nora took care of Barney.",33,28419

"06","18","Lily ","Wow, she nursed you back to health?",37,28423
"06","18","Barney ","No. I didn't even see her boobs. She just took care of me.",38,28424
"06","18","Robin "," Oh, hey, guys. This is Nate. Nate, these are my friends.",39,28425
"06","18","Nate ","What's up. guys? Nate Scooberman. But everyone calls me Scooby. I'd love to hang out, but I really gotta hit the john.",40,28426
"06","18","Ted ","Uh, yeah, it's right in here... Scooby.",41,28427
"06","18","Nate ","Thanks, brah. I like you guys.",42,28428
"06","18","Marshall ","Oh, Robin, if you weren't so much stronger than me, I would slap you.",43,28429
"06","18","Robin "," What? You told me to meet someone.",44,28430
"06","18","Marshall ","I know, and, look, he seems plenty nice, but I didn't mean bring home the first guy you bump into on the street.",45,28431
"06","18","Robin "," Actually, I met him in the park.",46,28432
"06","18","Ted ","Should have just let you get a dog.",47,28433
"06","18","Barney ","Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist.",48,28434
"06","18","Lily ","Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared?",49,28435
"06","18","Barney ","No.",50,28436

"06","18","Barney ","Yes!",52,28438
"06","18","Lily ","Okay, fine. On one condition. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora. She seems like something special.",53,28439
"06","18","Barney ","Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.* Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang *",54,28440

"06","18","The cardiologist"," Are we done?",56,28442
"06","18","Barney ","* A bang-bang, bangity-bang. *",57,28443
"06","18","The cardiologist"," Well, Barney, your heart sounds fine.",58,28444
"06","18","Barney ","See, Lily? She was worried.",59,28445
"06","18","The cardiologist"," Although it seems like you might have a slight arrhythmia.",60,28446
"06","18","Lily ","Ow! Nails, nails!",61,28447
"06","18","The cardiologist"," It's probably nothing to worry about, but I'd like you to wear this heart monitor for the next 24 hours.",62,28448
"06","18","Barney ","Twen... Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight.",63,28449
"06","18","The cardiologist"," Don't worry. It's totally safe. Unless part of your big date involves connecting yourself to a car battery.",64,28450
"06","18","Barney ","Well, now it doesn't.",65,28451
"06","18",NA,"Ted from 2030: And exactly 24 hours later, they returned for the results.",66,28452
"06","18","The cardiologist"," Okay, everything looks fine here, although I did notice a few irregularities. There's nothing to be...alarmed about.",67,28453
"06","18","Barney ","Go on, Doctor.",68,28454
"06","18","The cardiologist"," What happened at 8:46 p.m. last night?",69,28455
"06","18","Barney ","Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner.",70,28456
"06","18","Nora ","This might be a little forward, but do you have a b*mb strapped to your chest?",71,28457
"06","18","Barney ","This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing.",72,28458
"06","18","Nora ","Oh, I'm so sorry. I've been trying not to stare at your chest all night.",73,28459
"06","18","Barney ","What's that like?",74,28460
"06","18","Nora ","So is everything okay?",75,28461
"06","18","Barney ","My friend's dad passed away from a sudden heart attack. So I'm just getting myself checked out, too.",76,28462

"06","18","Barney ","Thanks.",78,28464
"06","18","Nora ","Um, Barney, what I'm about to say is going to sound a little weird, but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it.",79,28465
"06","18","Barney ","Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just... No. What is it?",80,28466
"06","18","Nora ","I want to get married. I mean, not tonight, or even to you, necessarily. But that's what I want. And if that's going to scare you off, then I'd rather it scare you off now. I want a family, and I want to live in a little house with a garden and a tree for the kids to climb. And I want to go to sleep every night with the same person by my side, and wake up next to him in the morning every morning for the rest of our lives. Just thought you should know that.",81,28467
"06","18","Lily ","You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora!",82,28468
"06","18","Barney ","That's exactly what I want, too.",83,28469
"06","18","Nate ","I'm really into gardening, but these squirrels keep messing with my tomatoes. Every time I see them in the backyard, I'm like, ""get out of here!"" And they run off, but sure enough, a few minutes later, there they are again. And I'm like, ""get out of here!"" So annoying. I smell food. Does this place have a kitchen? I'll be right back.",84,28470
"06","18","Robin "," Okay, but you have to admit that he is a lot of fun.",85,28471
"06","18","Marshall ","Oh, I actually think he's quite intelligent for what he is.",86,28472
"06","18","Robin "," And what is he?",87,28473
"06","18","Marshall ","He's a dog.",88,28474
"06","18","Ted ","He's totally a dog.",89,28475
"06","18","Robin "," What? You saw him hitting on someone?",90,28476
"06","18","Marshall ","No, I didn't say, ""He a dawg."" I said, ""He's a dog."" As in, a dog. I think we've all noticed a few curious mannerisms. Or rather, doggerisms.",91,28477

"06","18","Nate ","Where?",93,28479

"06","18","Marshall ","Okay, you're right. He dropped it.",97,28483
"06","18","Robin "," He's not a dog.",98,28484
"06","18","Ted ","Robin, it's fine. You said you wanted a dog and you got one. And the best part is, he got his shots.",99,28485
"06","18","Nate ","Hey, guys, got my shots.",100,28486
"06","18","Marshall ","You are so playful.",101,28487
"06","18","Ted ","Nice job fetching those.",102,28488
"06","18","Lily ","Yeah, guys, cut it out. Scooby, sit.",103,28489
"06","18","Marshall ","So, Scooby, we were thinking if you're going to be hanging out with our Robin, you should be properly vetted.",104,28490
"06","18","Ted ","Uh, yeah. We hope our nosiness doesn't give you ""paws.""",105,28491

"06","18","Nate ","I'll get 'em.",122,28508
"06","18","Barney ","Hey, guys, this is Nora.",123,28509
"06","18","Nora ","We were just passing by, and I wanted to pop in for two reasons. First, I wanted to let you know that your friend Barney is being a perfect gentleman.",124,28510

"06","18","Nora ","How many do you want?",130,28516
"06","18","Barney ","Three... one of each. You?",131,28517
"06","18","Nora ","Three. All in an old stone house.",132,28518
"06","18","Barney ","Yeah, with ivy growing on it.",133,28519
"06","18","Barney ","And we must have a pool.",134,28520
"06","18","Nora ","We? A pool sounds brilliant. Are you for real, Barney?",135,28521
"06","18","Barney ","I really am.",136,28522
"06","18","Robin ","Unbelievable.",137,28523
"06","18","Nora ","I know, right? And the second reason we popped in is 'cause I need to use the loo. But when I get back, I'm dying to hear all about Mr. Softy here.",138,28524

"06","19","Jerry ","Barney wasn't interested in my apology. He just wanted me to be cool. And I was so desperate to connect with him. I did something I'm not proud of. I started bragging.",114,28753
"06","19","Jerry ","I bet you didn't know this about me, Barney, but I've published two nonfiction books about asparagus. And one fiction. I'm credited with inventing the word ""furgling."" It means fumbling for keys. So then all the county fair judges started chanting, ""More quiche! More quiche!"" I guess you could call me the LeBron James of drapes.",115,28754
"06","19","Jerry ","I could tell he just wanted me to be this big ladies' man, so...",116,28755
"06","19","Jerry ","What a hottie, huh? I'm sure you're a real player.",117,28756
"06","19","Barney ","Big-time.",118,28757
"06","19","Jerry ","Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate.",119,28758
"06","19","Barney ","Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the ""Father Knows Breast,"" there's the ""Bush Dynasty,"" the ""Lick Father, Lick Son.""",120,28759
"06","19","Jerry ","Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that.",121,28760
"06","19","Barney ","Why?",122,28761

"06","19","Barney ","You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this.",124,28763
"06","19","Jerry ","I made him wait all these years for me and... I'm just not the guy he wanted me to be. I know I don't deserve it, but... I need another chance to connect with my son.",125,28764
"06","19","Lily "," We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.",126,28765
"06","19","Barney ","What?",127,28766
"06","19","Marshall ","You're having dinner with him tonight.",128,28767
"06","19","Barney ","No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that.",129,28768
"06","19","Robin ","Are you sure it's not more than that?",130,28769
"06","19","Barney ","Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again.",131,28770
"06","19","Marshall ","No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road.",132,28771
"06","19","Barney ","Fine, I'll go.",133,28772
"06","19","Marshall ","Awesome. Um, Lily, keys. (She throws them way too hard, they land in the trees) I'm literally 11 inches from you.",134,28773

"06","19","Lily "," Guess now we wait.",140,28779
"06","19","Marshall ","Hey, I got an idea how to pass the time. A little trivia game. Robin, reindeer: real or fake?",141,28780
"06","19","Robin ","Okay, I'm not an idiot. Reindeer are obviously f... re... fake?",142,28781
"06","19","Marshall ","Yikes! I'm surrounded by a bunch of dum-dums. Good thing I don't have any gaps in my knowledge. I am perfect. Oh, for the love of God, guys, enough already.",143,28782
"06","19","Lily "," What, baby?",144,28783
"06","19","Marshall ","You've been treating me with kid gloves ever since my dad died.",145,28784
"06","19","Robin ","That's not true.",146,28785
"06","19","Lily "," Robin, don't disagree with Marshall.",147,28786
"06","19","Robin ","I'm sorry.",148,28787
"06","19","Marshall ","I first noticed it at the bar.",149,28788
"06","19","Marshall ","Hey, Lily, (his voice cracks) Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys. [...] The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie.",150,28789
"06","19","Barney ","It ages well, that's the thing.",151,28790
"06","19","Marshall ","You guys like my new soul patch?",152,28791
"06","19","Robin ","Righteous hair tab, brotha.",153,28792
"06","19","Marshall ","And once I figured it out, I started doing crazy stuff to see how far you'd let me go. [...]Hey, guys. This is Rex. He's a possum. I found him in the trash. He lives with us now.",154,28793
"06","19","Lily "," I love him.",155,28794
"06","19","Marshall ","Lily, we are living with a possum. Rex is violent and he hates us.",156,28795
"06","19","Lily "," But, baby, you just lost your dad. None of us wants to upset you.",157,28796
"06","19","Marshall ","Please. If you guys really want me to get over the worst tragedy of my life, I'm begging you, tear me a new one. But not like Rex tried to in my sleep last night.",158,28797
"06","19","Jerry ","J.J., dinner. When I got your letter, I dug this up. You were probably too young to remember, but this is you, this is me, and, of course, ZZ Top.",159,28798
"06","19","Barney ","I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas.",160,28799
"06","19","Jerry ","Yeah, I used to love taking you backstage. You were the coolest little kid.",161,28800
"06","19","JJ ","Hi, Barney. It's great to finally meet you.",162,28801
"06","19","Barney ","J.J., I'm talking to Dad right now. God.",163,28802
"06","19","Marshall ","Seriously, it's time. What are my gaps?",164,28803
"06","19","Ted ","Well, I guess maybe one gap you have is... you can't wink.",165,28804
"06","19","Marshall ","Don't you think that maybe we should go home and, uh, ""do the laundry""",166,28805
"06","19","Lily "," You can't swallow pills.",167,28806
"06","19","Robin ","Ooh, ooh, I got one. You think John Kennedy and Jack Kennedy are the same person. (laughs) Right? What?",168,28807
"06","19","Cherryl ","So, Barney, I understand you have a pretty big job with a bank.",169,28808
"06","19","Barney ","Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.?",170,28809
"06","19","JJ ","I'm 11.",171,28810
"06","19","Barney ","Oh, well, huh, now we all know you make excuses. I was talking about money.",172,28811
"06","19","Cherryl ","Actually, J.J. has a job. Tell him, J.J.",173,28812
"06","19","JJ ","I got a paper route.",174,28813
"06","19","Barney ","Good time to get into print media. Am I right, Dad?",175,28814
"06","19","Jerry ","Good slam, Barney.",176,28815

"06","19","JJ ","Fourth period?",181,28820
"06","19","Barney ","Sounds like you're having your fourth period. Am I right, Dad?!",182,28821
"06","19","Jerry ","Got him again.",183,28822
"06","19","Cherryl ","Jerry!",184,28823
"06","19","Jerry ","Oh, okay, Barney. Uh, maybe that's enough.",185,28824
"06","19","Barney ","Why? J.J. started it. What does J.J. even stand for anyway? J... Jerky... Jerkface?",186,28825
"06","19","Jerry ","J.J. stands for Jerome Jr.",187,28826
"06","19","Barney ","Jerome Jr...? Oh. He's... he's named after you. Excuse me.",188,28827
"06","19","JJ ","I like having a brother.",189,28828
"06","19","Ted ","You always add too much water to oatmeal.",190,28829

"06","19","Jerry ","Barney, what is going on?",198,28837
"06","19","Barney ","This is mine.",199,28838
"06","19","Jerry ","I don't understand.",200,28839

"06","19","Jerry ","Look, Barney, I know I screwed up...",206,28845

Just put the pointy end into the grooves. That's it. Now turn it. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. I have no good excuse, Barney. It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down. It took courage to send me that letter. More courage than I've ever had. I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I... I just have no idea where to begin.",208,28847
"06","19","Barney ","Can you help me with this?",209,28848
"06","19","Jerry ","Here, got it. Look, if you... ever feel like you're ready, I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.",210,28849
"06","19","Barney ","Bye.",211,28850

"06","20","Lily ","Isn't it hard for you guys to be on opposite sides of something like this?",8,28864
"06","20","Ted ","Of course you feel that way, Lily. You and Marshall have basically melded into one big hermaphroditic blob. And that's fine for you guys. But some of us want a partner who challenges us to grow and evolve.",9,28865

"06","20",NA,"Robin:Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?",99,28955
"06","20","Barney ","Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. ""Barney, we have to talk about your father."" ""Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil."" ""Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session ""between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute."" I don't need this!",100,28956
"06","20","Ted ","Ah, Lily Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple! I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks. One: your mom didn't seem to mind it last night on her...",101,28957
"06","20","Lily ","Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right? (Ted says something in spanish) Perfect. Let's go.",102,28958
"06","20","Barney ","Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?",103,28959
"06","20","Marshall ","Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't.",104,28960
"06","20","Barney ","Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time.",105,28961
"06","20","Robin ","(Robin is standing at the door) Oh, my God!",106,28962
"06","20","Barney ","How long have you been there?",107,28963
"06","20","Robin ","You don't remember?",108,28964
"06","20","Robin ","Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.",109,28965
"06","20","Barney ","Oh, no, I'm fine.",110,28966
"06","20","Robin ","Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?",111,28967
"06","20",NA,"Barney:Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?",112,28968
"06","20","Robin ","Yeah.",113,28969
"06","20",NA,"Barney:Right. So, um... Chinese?",114,28970
"06","20","Ted ","You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Marshall doesn't make us a worse couple.",115,28971
"06","20","Lily ","You're right. I-If you and Zoey are happy, then who am I to judge? I'm so sorry.",116,28972
"06","20","Ted ","Oh, my God, is that how support feels? It's so warm and wonderful. Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy.",117,28973
"06","20","Lily ","But I thought you liked being challenged.",118,28974
"06","20","Ted ","Nobody likes being challenged! Couldn't she agree with me just once, even on something little, like... like what movie to see or-or what topping to get on our pizza or... oh, I don't know, my lifelong dream of building a skyscraper in New York City?!",119,28975
"06","20","Lily ","Well, in her defense, hamburger pizza, Ted? What are you, 12?",120,28976
"06","20","Ted ","You were right, Lily. I mean, Zoey's great, but... sometimes I do wish we were a little more like you and Marshall. There he is. Here we go. (Ted says some incomprehensible things in spanish)",121,28977
"06","20","Man ","I'm sorry. I don't speak... whatever it is you're speaking.",122,28978
"06","20","Ted ","Um, he speaks perfect English.",123,28979
"06","20","Lily ","Yeah, I-I know.",124,28980
"06","20","Ted ","Then why did you ask me to come?",125,28981
"06","20","Lily ","So you can drive him to the fund-raiser. Supporting Marshall this much is driving me crazy. I'm going to Spain-- my flight leaves in 45 minutes. Adios, muchacho.",126,28982
"06","20","Ted ","W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain?",127,28983
"06","20","Lily ","You were right. If I hear myself say ""Baby, you have my full support"" one more time, I swear I'm gonna m*rder someone!",128,28984
"06","20","Ted ","What are you gonna tell Marshall, huh? And when are you coming back?",129,28985
"06","20","Lily ","I honestly haven't thought it all the way through, and I don't intend to. All I know is that I'm a ticking time b*mb, and if I don't do something for me right away, I swear I'm gonna explode!",130,28986
"06","20","Ted ","Wow, tha... that's an evocative metaphor to use for your nonthreatening, totally patriotic emotions. U.S.A.! Okay, Lily, I get it.",131,28987
"06","20","Lily ","Marshall's been asking a lot lately.",132,28988
"06","20","Ted ","But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough.",133,28989
"06","20","Lily ","I've never been good at that. And now, ever since his dad died, I-I feel like it's my job to just be fine with everything. But I'm not. I'm not fine that he volunteers our apartment for a giant fund-raiser and that he's not thinking about how we're gonna pay any of our bills and that, apparently, we've given up on trying to have kids.",134,28990
"06","20","Ted ","Lil...",135,28991
"06","20","Lily ","Look, I'm sorry, Ted, I just, I gotta do this. (Lily leaves)",136,28992
"06","20","Man ","My bag? Oh, no. I got it.",137,28993
"06","20","Barney ","There's nothing to talk about.",138,28994
"06","20","Robin ","You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.",139,28995
"06","20","Barney ","I don't want to talk about it, okay?",140,28996
"06","20","Robin ","Why not?",141,28997
"06","20","Barney ","Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.",142,28998
"06","20","Robin ","I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... (quietly): ticking.",143,28999
"06","20","Barney ","That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?",144,29000
"06","20","Robin ","No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.",145,29001
"06","20","Barney ","Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.",146,29002
"06","20","Robin ","Huh?",147,29003
"06","20","Barney ","It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.",148,29004
"06","20","Barney ","Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.",149,29005
"06","20","Marshall ","Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.",150,29006
"06","20","Barney ","I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...",151,29007
"06","20",NA,"Barney:...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted. (quiet sobbing) You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?",152,29008
"06","20","Robin ","What is wrong with you?",153,29009
"06","20","Marshall ","Hey, Professor Rodriguez, thank you so much for coming.",154,29010
"06","20",NA,"Prof. Rodriguez: Oh, my pleasure. I have to use the restroom. Do you have some extra invitations?",155,29011
"06","20","Marshall ","Right over there. Enjoy. Hey. Hey, thanks for picking him up.",156,29012
"06","20","Ted ","Yeah, absolutely. Um, listen, something happened at the airport. Um...",157,29013
"06","20","Marshall ","What?",158,29014
"06","20","Ted ","Well, we got there, and, uh, Lily...(sighs) Lily...",159,29015
"06","20","Lily ","Marshall, hey. Sorry, I, uh, I had to park and-and grab some ice. Sorry.",160,29016
"06","20","Marshall ","Oh, thanks, babe. You would not believe how much this one has done to help throw this party, Ted. I don't know how she does it. Can't be easy, huh, Lil?",161,29017
"06","20","Lily ","Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I-I need to talk to you about something.",162,29018
"06","20","Marshall ","No, you know what? Me, too. Um... I want to thank you for being so supportive of me in all this. I've been at the NRDC for less than a week, and I've already done more to be proud of than in two years at GNB. I can't believe how good it feels. But now, it's time for me to find a way to help the Earth and get paid for it, because I can't put that burden entirely on you. So, starting tomorrow, I'll look for something with a paycheck. What do you think?",163,29019
"06","20","Lily ","Baby, you have my full support.",164,29020
"06","20","Zoey ","Ted.",165,29021
"06","20","Ted ","Hey! What are you doing here?",166,29022
"06","20","Zoey ","This is really important to Marshall, so I came to show my support.",167,29023
"06","20","Ted ","This you can be supportive of?!",168,29024
"06","20","Zoey ","What is that supposed to mean?",169,29025
"06","20","Ted ","I have the chance to build a skyscraper in the best city on Earth, and who's the one leading the charge to k*ll that dream? My girlfriend!",170,29026
"06","20","Zoey ","Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about my lifelong dream of not seeing every beautiful building in Manhattan bulldozed?",171,29027
"06","20",NA,"Ted from 2030: And in that moment, I realized, though I really cared about Zoey, I couldn't do this for the next 50 years. I had to break up with her. But then... Kids, some couples always support each other, and some couples always challenge each other, but is one really better than the other? Yes. Support is better. Way better. But I'd have to learn that the hard way.",172,29028
"06","20","Lily ","You're too young. This isn't fair.",173,29029
"06","20","Marshall ","We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end.",174,29030
"06","20",NA,"Barney, weakly: Thank you, Marshall. (coughs weakly) Marshall... can I ask one final favor, my friend?",175,29031
"06","20","Marshall ","Yes, of course, of course... anything.",176,29032
"06","20","Barney ","Eat this meatball sub.",177,29033
"06","20","Marshall ","Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...",178,29034
"06","20","Barney ","I don't have much time!",179,29035
"06","20","Marshall ","Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?",180,29036
"06","20",NA,"Barney, with a mean laugh: I'm not sick, you idiots! I've racked up $30,000 of uninsured medical bills for symptoms I don't even have. Totally worth it! You should see the look on your face. Oh, wait, you can't-- 'cause it's covered in marinara sauce!",181,29037
"06","20","Ted ","Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas.",182,29038
"06","21","Jerry ","Barney, afraid this is good-bye. Your buzz k*ll of a ma... thinks I'm a... a bad influence on you.",1,29039
"06","21","Barney ","What? That's... What is that word you taught me? ""Bull"" something?",2,29040
"06","21","Jerry ","But she's your mother and I'm... you know, I'm just your Uncle Jerry. So, this is the last time I can see you.",3,29041
"06","21","Barney ","But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be... Led-and-Jerry.",4,29042
"06","21","Jerry ","Sorry, buddy, but this is it. But don't you forget your training. What's a magician's best friend?",5,29043
"06","21","Barney ","A drunk audience.",6,29044
"06","21",NA,"Jerry, laughing: Attaboy. You still got that button from the festival we went to? Now... I'm gonna put this right inside your brain, behind your ear... so that I'll know that you won't forget me. See you, buddy. And hey... Never... stop... partying.",7,29045
"06","21",NA,"Ted from 2030: Kids, in 1983, Barney watched his father walk out of his life. And in 2011, when their first reunion ended badly...",8,29046

"06","21","Barney ","Bye.",11,29049
"06","21",NA,"Ted from 2030: And that was almost the end of it. Except, a few weeks later...",12,29050
"06","21","Barney ","I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess.",13,29051
"06","21","Marshall ","Mmm. Your dad?",14,29052
"06","21","Barney ","My dad!",15,29053
"06","21","Barney ","Barney Stinson.",16,29054
"06","21","Jerry ","Hi, Barney. It's your dad. Look, would you like to go fishing with me and J.J. on Sunday morning?",17,29055
"06","21","Barney ","Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years.",18,29056
"06","21","Jerry ","Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... ""Crazy Jerry""? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right?",19,29057
"06","21","Barney ","You do not know how right you are.",20,29058
"06","21","Barney ","Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything.",21,29059
"06","21","Ted ","You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.",22,29060
"06","21","Barney ","I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues.",23,29061
"06","21","Robin ","Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.",24,29062
"06","21",NA,"Barney:Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?",25,29063
"06","21","Barney ","Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.",26,29064
"06","21","Lily ","That's why you brought these guys.",27,29065
"06","21",NA,"Barney:No. That's why I brought these guys. (He gets several cards out of his inside pocket) I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards.",28,29066
"06","21","Marshall ","Improvements?!",29,29067
"06","21",NA,"Barney:Yeah.",30,29068
"06","21","Marshall ","Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards.",31,29069
"06","21",NA,"Barney:Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage.",32,29070
"06","21","Lily ","Whoo-hoo!",33,29071
"06","21","Marshall ","Gross!",34,29072
"06","21",NA,"Barney:Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself. (chuckles) Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about.",35,29073
"06","21","Ted ","Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, ""Man is least himself when he talks...""",36,29074
"06","21",NA,"Barney:Ted, card.",37,29075
"06","21","Ted ","Ah. You're right... ""No quoting Oscar Wilde.""",38,29076

"06","21","Robin ","Aw, man! Why?",40,29078
"06","21","Barney ","I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh... (chuckles) no, thanks.",41,29079
"06","21","Lily ","Hey, Barney... love the new identities. Little thing... instead of being a naked super ninja, can I be Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada?",42,29080
"06","21","Ted ","How good was that movie?",43,29081
"06","21","Barney ","And... hence new identities.",44,29082
"06","21",NA,"Ted from 2030: And so Barney's dad finally showed up.",45,29083
"06","21","Barney ","Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer.",46,29084

"06","21","Man ","I was trying on the pants.",96,29134
"06","21","Robin ","Oh. (Laughs)",97,29135

"06","22","Robin ","It happened, and it changed me. How about daiquiris?",102,29386

"06","22","Zoey ","Marshall made his own choice. Why aren't you mad at him?",130,29414
"06","22","Ted ","Because he's going through a lot right now. He, he's looking for something to believe in, and you took advantage of that. You're, you're just like those Internet swindlers who tricked him into paying 300 bucks for a lock of Sasquatch fur.",131,29415

"06","23","Robin ","Okay, Ted... you know I love Zoey. But, look, sometimes... I go play chess in the park. And the key to chess... Okay, I play online. But the key to chess... Okay, it's Angry Birds! But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario.",85,29583

"06","23","Lily ","I mean, yes, this is a huge, divisive issue for them. Which means no matter what happens, there's gonna be a lot of resentment. Probably lasting for years... infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship. So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this.",110,29608
