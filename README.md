We are almost there

Updates 3/1/2022--
Currently we are mainly working on the script "get_lines_all_characters.R". We are no longer interested in "create_words_per_character.R".
Through the R script I "get_lines_all_characters", we were able to gain a clean data frame with 5 columns. We also uploaded the csv. file "lines_all_c" to the main branch for future usage.
