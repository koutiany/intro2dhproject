0,1,1,barney ," hey, so you know how I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls? Well, now I've got a new favorite: Lebanese girls! Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians. Okay, meet me at the bar in fifteen minutes, and Suit up! Where's your suit!? Just once when I say suit up, I wish you'd put on a suit. It was a blazer! I see what this is about. Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met? Ted, I'm going to teach you how to live. (Ted's shocked) Barney, we met at the urinal. Lesson one, lose the goatee. It doesn't look good with your suit. Lesson two, get a suit. Suits are cool. (Points to self with bear bottle in hand) Exhibit A. (Flirts to a woman unseen) Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till you're... thirty. I thought I was your best friend. Ted, say I'm your best friend. Good! And as your best friend, I suggest we play a little game called... ""Have you met Ted?""  Hi, have you met Ted? (Leaves and watches from a distance).  how does Carl land a Lebanese girl? Exactly-the guy doesn't even own a suit!  Hey, have you met Ted?  De-wait for it-nied! Denied! I thought we were playing laser tag tomorrow night?  Hey loser, how's not playing laser tag? Because playing laser tag is awesome! Oh, I k*lled you Connor; don't make me get your mom! Okay, meet me at the bar in fifteen minutes-AND SUIT UP! I can't believe you're still not wearing a SUIT! What is she goanna-is she goanna bat her eyes at you in Morse code (bats eyes)?? Ted (bats eyes) Kiss me-No, you just kiss her! Ee-(Kisses Marshal) Did Marshall give me the signal? But see-at least, tonight, I get to sleep knowing, Marshall and Me... never going to happen. You should've kissed her. A week? That's like-a year in hot girl time. She'll forget all about you. Mark my words: you will never see that one again. Actually, that is a perfect metaphor. By the way, did I congratulate you two? (Raises glass to Lily and Marshall) Alright, but under one condition.  look at you, you beautiful b*st*rd, you suited up! This is totally going in my blog! Ted's goanna get it on with a TV reporter (nods. Laughs.) This just in. Okay (holds hand up for high-fives) Why does he get to be the best man? (Shouts out) I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND! You're wearing a suit! So, (looks to the cabdriver) Ranjit... you must've done it with a Lebanese girl. The women hot there?  Simple no would have sufficed. (To Ranjit) She's lovely. So, Marshall. This ""Olive Theory"" based on you and Lily? You hate olives? Lily loves them, you can't stand them. Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th Street, dish of olives-you had some. What up? I swear. But you like olives! Marshall, I'm going to get you an early wedding present. Don't get married. Come on man, you said your stomach's been hurting, right? You know what that is! Hunger. You're hungry for experience. Hungry for something new. Hungry for olives. But you're too scared to do anything about it. Why are we still sitting here? Let's go! We can still make last call. What do you say Lil? (Pirate Accent) Yo, ho ho and a bottle o' rum? (Silence) 'Cuz you're a pirate... You think they're doing it in front of the dogs? I had this girl in college; she had a golden retriever- Hit it Ranjit. (They drive off) There's no such thing as the signal. But yeah-that was the signal. Yeah Ted, we're not on you anymore."
1,1,1,cabdriver ,"Whoa, whoa, whoa-did you hit her? no, no, no, no-it's okay, go on. (Turns meter on.) So these, spankin's...you in pajamas or going ""naturelle"""
2,1,1,carl ,"By the way, you should've kissed her."
3,1,1,daughter ,"Yeah, is this going to take a while? I thought this was about how you met mom!"
4,1,1,lily ,"Urgh. I'm exhausted. It was finger painting day at school, and a five year old boy (takes coat off revealing a purple hand print on her right breast) got to second base with me. Wow, you're cooking? Aww-(They kiss) Are you sure that's a good idea after last time? You looked really creepy without eyebrows. So there's more surprises? Like what? Aw-honey. Champagne! (hands it to Marshall)  No, you are too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne! Then open it! You are unbelievable, Marshall. No-(Scene splits in half and shows both Lily and Marshall on top arguing and Ted and Yasmine on the bottom mingling) Of course, you idiot! (hugs him and they fall back) Did you know there's a pop tart under your fridge? aww (claps. They kiss)  Hit me? Please, this guy could barely even spank me in bed for fun. He's all like, (hits ice in bag using to cover eye) ""Oh, did that hurt?"" and I'm like, ""Come on, let me have it you pansy!"" (realizes) Wow, complete stranger. How long have you been sitting there!? Stupid eye patch. The olive theory. wait, it's only the break of ten-thirty. What happened? Aww, Ted that's so sweet. So you chickened out like the little bitch. Ted, anyone who's single would tell you the same thing. Even the dumbest single person alive, and if you don't believe me...call him. Ooo. She's cute! (To Carl) Hey Carl, turn it up! Let's go (pulls Marshall up) We're coming with you. Kiss her, Ted. Kiss her good. No! Okay-that's my Barney Limit. (Starts to leave the cab) I'm goanna see if that Bodega has a bathroom. (Leaves) We'll make it work. (They kiss.) Okay, eye patch gone-(takes eye patch off and throws it at Barney) And we can't just abandon Ted. If it doesn't go well up there he's gonna need some support. Okay, we can go to the bar, just stop talking. That long lingering handshake-you should've kissed her! I am so turned on right now.  to the future!"
5,1,1,marshal ,"Ah, Carl thank you. Something I gotta do."
6,1,1,marshall ," Will you marry me. Got it. Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted.  yeah, sorry. We thought you were asleep. Yeah, what are you doing tonight? Hey! Yes, I am. I can handle this; I'm full of surprises tonight. BOOGITY BOO! And that's all of them! I'm goanna go... cook. (Leaves) Okay, look what I got (runs to the fridge. Takes out wine bottle)  Yeah. (hands it back) I'm not scared. Fine (takes bottle. Looks at it for a couple of seconds) Please open it (hands it to Lily)  will you marry me? I promised Ted we wouldn't do that. No, but dibs. Where's that champagne? I wanna drink a toast with my fiancé. I don't know why I was so scared of this. Pretty easy right? (Pops cork, hit's Lily's eye)  OH! I'm sorry, Lily. I'm so sorry. Take us to the hospital. Lilly? Oh let's see (thinks) she likes dogs? Can quote obscure lines from ""Ghostbusters""? She hates olives! Awesome! Oh, it is on! It is on (imitates robot) till the break of dawn. So? Did you kiss her? No! (To Lily) I didn't, I swear. Huh, guy didn't jump Oh-Dude, it's midnight. As your future lawyer I'm goanna advise you: that's freakin' crazy! Word up! Kiss the crap out of that girl Go back in there! He's in. Yeah... Yeah, hate olives.  You have to swear that this does not leave this cab. On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad; Lily asked if she could have my olives. I said, ""Sure... I hate olives."" Well, I was eighteen, okay? I was a virgin. Been waiting for my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives. Yeah, I'm scared, okay? But when I think about spending the rest of my life with Lily... committing forever, no other women (Lily appears behind Marshall in the open window) doesn't scare me at all. I'm marrying that girl. (Lily pops her head in from the window. Marshall turns around) Lily. Lily, I like olives. It's been like twenty minutes. You think they're doin' it? Doggie style. (Laughs) That was the signal!  To my fiancé!"
7,1,1,narrator ,"Kids, I'm going to tell you an incredible story. The story of how I met your mother No Yes. (Kids are annoyed) Twenty-five years ago, before I was dad, I had this whole other life. It was way back in 2005. I was twenty-seven just starting to make it as an architect and living in New York with my friend Marshall, my best friend from college. My life was good and then Uncle Marshall went and screwed the whole thing up. What was I doing? Your Uncle Marshall was taking the biggest step of his life, and me-I'm calling your Uncle, Barney. Marshall was in his second year of law school, so he was pretty good at thinking on his feet. There are two big questions a man has to ask in life. One you plan out for months, the other just slips out when you're half drunk at some bar. and there she was. It was like something from an old movie. Where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor, turns to his buddy and says, ""see that girl? I'm going to marry her someday"" The next night, I took her out to this little bistro in Brooklyn. Son, a piece of advice. When you go on a first date you really don't wanna say ""smurf pen1s"". Girls don't ordinarily like that. But that was no ordinary girl. As I walked up to that door a million thoughts raced through my mind. Unfortunately, one particular thought did not. I asked her about it years later, and yeah, that was the signal. I could've kissed her. But that's the funny thing about destiny. Will you relax? I'm getting to it. (Son and daughter sit back unpleased) like I said:"
8,1,1,producer ," there you are! We've got a jumper! Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge. Come on, you're covering it!"
9,1,1,rangit ,Signal (nods)
10,1,1,ranjit ,"Actually, I'm from Bangladesh. Here's a picture of my wife! (Shows picture)  I swear. aww. To one hell of a night!"
11,1,1,robin ,"Let me guess, (points) Ted? I'm a reporter for Metro News 1. Well, kind of a reporter. I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news, you know. Like-um-monkey that can play the ukulele. I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon. Yeah, see the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend so tonight every guy is... ""The enemy"". She would love that! It does look fun in the movies. Oh, I can't. I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday. Some guys attempting to make a big (cut) so my news is covering it. Yeah, he's going to eat it too, it's another record.  Yeah, (agrees) What the hell (passes number to Ted. Throws drink on Ted's face) JERK! (Walks away. Whispers) that was fun. Wow that is one bad-ass blue French horn. Mhmm. I've got five dogs. I love a scotch that's old enough to order its own scotch. Ray, when someone asks you if you're a god you say, ""Yes!"" Do you want these? (Holding up remaining olives from her plate) I hate olives. You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever.  they're all yours. I've gotta get one of those blue French horns for over my fireplace. It's gotta be blue, it's gotta be French. No. It's a smurf pen1s, we're no dice. Um, alright. I'll be right there. (To Ted) I'm sorry. I had a really great time tonight. ...persuaded him to reconsider at which point the man came down off the ledge, giving this bizarre story a happy ending. Reporting from  Metro One News, back to you bill. I've got five dogs.  Ted? Come on up. So, Ted. What brings you back to Brooklyn at one in the morning in a-suit. Would you like those olives with some Gin and Vermouth? For starters (turns music on. Leaves to the kitchen) I think I like your ""Olive Theory"". I think I like your nose. What? You love me? Hold on. (Gets up) Wait a minute. (Hands him Olives) Promised you these. Good night, psycho (smiles). (Ted sarcastically clutches heart. Realizes friends left him) Oh, um-two blocks (comes out) that way (points) and take a right. Everyone thinks they're a good kisser. Good night, Ted. (Shake hands.) that's a pretty great hand shake. (Looks him in the eyes)"
12,1,1,robin's dumped friend," Hey, what's taking so long?"
13,1,1,son ,Are we being punished for something? Aunt Robin?
14,1,1,son and daughter, What?
15,1,1,ted ,"Yes, perfect! And then you're engaged, you pop the champagne! You drink a toast! You have s*x on the kitchen floor... Don't have s*x on our kitchen floor. Dude, are you kidding? It's you and Lily! I've been there for all the big moments of you and Lily. The night you met. Your first date... other first things. It's physics Marshall, if the bottom bunk moves, the top bunk moves too. My god, you're getting engaged tonight. Hey, you wanna do something tonight? Hey. I did that one time. You know, ever since college it's been Marshall and Lily and me. Now it's going to be Marshall and Lily... and me. They'll get married, start a family-before long I'm the weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call ""Uncle Ted"". Oh, right. Hi. I'm not wearing a suit. Thirty, right. You're right. I guess it's just, you're best friend gets engaged-you start thinking about that stuff. You're my best friend, Barney. Wai-no, no, no. We're not playing ""Have You Met Ted?""  Hi, I'm Ted. It's a very pretty name. I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am. I just couldn't imagine settling down right now. Well maybe eventually. Some fall day. Possibly in Central Park. Simple ceremony, we'll write our own vows. But--eh--no DJ, people will dance. I'm not going to worry about it! Damn it, why did Marshall have to get engaged? (Yasmine laughs) Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh? Well, you're clearly drunk (pulls her wine glass away. Hold up glass to bartender) ONE MORE FOR THE LADY!  you wanna go out sometime? Sup, Carl? Why am I freaking out all of a sudden? This is crazy! I'm not ready to settle down. It's always been ""don't even think about it till you're thirty"" Plus Marshall's found the love of his life. Even if I was ready, which I'm not, but if I was it's like, ""Okay, I'm ready! Where is she?"" (Spots Robin) Hey Barney, see that girl? So what do you do?  Oh. Bigger like, uh, gorilla with an up-right bass? Sorry, you're really pretty. (Robin laughs and waves to her friends) Oh, your friends don't seem too happy. You know if you don't make your friend feel better you could throw a drink at my face. I don't mind. Hey, you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night? That's going to take a week? Uh, I know this is a long shot, but how about tomorrow night? We're going out tomorrow night. Yeah, I was never going to go play laser tag. (Wipes alcohol off his face) Yeah. Sort of looks like a... Smurf pen1s. Mom, dad, I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby! Marshall, how have I always described my perfect woman? And I'm saving the best for last. The olive theory is based on my friends, Marshall and Lily. He hates olives, she loves them. In a weird way that's what makes them such a great couple. A Perfect balance (eats olive).  I can take them off your hands. No Green Clarinet? Come on, no purple tuba? Yeah. No. The moment wasn't right. (They sigh) Look, this woman could be my future wife; I want our first kiss to be amazing. What? I did not chicken out! You know what? I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate who hasn't been single since the first week of college. Hey, listen. I need your opinion on something. So these guys think I chickened out. What do you think? She didn't even give me the signal. Not if you don't get the signal. Urgh, I should've kissed her. What about when she gets back from Orlando? There she is... I'm goanna go kiss her. Right now. I never do anything crazy! I'm always waiting for the moment! Planning the moment! Well she's leaving tomorrow this may be the only moment I'm goanna get! I gotta do what that guy couldn't, I gotta take the leap! Okay not a perfect metaphor, for me it's fall in love and get married-for him it's... death. I'm doing this. (Starts to leave) (To Ranjit-Cabdriver) Stop the car. Uh-pull over right here. I gotta do something. Excuse me, pardon me. (grabs the Blue French Horn) Enjoy your coffee. (Runs away) go, go, GO! (looks to his friends. Shrugs) Everybody brings flowers.  Okay. Moment of truth. Wish me luck. (Exhales) Marshall, remember this night. When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech, you're goanna tell this story. (exits cab) Not good, not good, not good, not good. Hi! (Silence) I was just uh-(hold up Smurf pen1s, aka French Horn) I was just hoping to get those olives... that you said I could have. Are you trying to get me drunk?  Thank you. I think I like your French Horn. I think I'm in love with you. So Orlando, you goanna hit Disney World? Oh, god, I can't believe I said that. Why did I say that? Who says that? I should just go. (Gets up) Olives. Thanks. I love you. What's wrong with me? So when you tell this story to your friends, could you avoid the word ""psycho""? I prefer...eccentric. Great (before Robin closes the door) Umm... how do I get to the F Train? (upset/tired) Thanks. (Walks down the steps. Robin begins to walk in) You know what? (Robin stops. Ted turns around). I'm done being single. I'm not good at it. Look, obviously you can't tell a woman you just met you love her. But... it sucks that you can't. I'll tell you something though, if a woman-not you... just some hypothetical woman-were to bare with me through all this. I think I'd make a damn good husband. Because that's the stuff I'd be good at. Stuff like making her laugh and being a good father... and walking her five hypothetical dogs. Being a good kisser. Oh, I've got references. And I'm a good hand shaker And that was it, probably never see her again. (Silence) What? Carl!? (turns to friends) You guys weren't there. Guys, trust me. I've seen the signal. That was not the signal. That was not the signal!"
16,1,1,waitor ,"Hey, HEY!"
17,1,1,yasmine ,"Yasmine. Thanks, It's Lebanese. So do you think you'll ever get married? Actually, I think it's cute. I'm sorry; Carl's my boyfriend (points to bartender)"
18,1,1,,"Marshall:...she drinks scotch? Ted:...Barney? Lily, Marshall and Barney: What? Narrator:... it happens whether you plan it or not. I mean I... Narrator:... never thought I'd see that girl again. But it... Narrator:...turns out, I was just too close... Narrator:...to the puzzle to see the picture that was forming. Because that kids... Narrator:...is the true story, of how I met your Aunt Robin. Narrator:...it's a long story."
19,1,2,barney ,"I suggest we play a little game I like to call, ""Have you Met Ted?"" (Taps Robin's shoulder) Hi! Have you met Ted? (Leaves)  No! As your sponsor I will not let you relapse. You blew it; it's over-move on. Yeah, cuz nothing says ""Casual"" like inviting a hundred people over just to ""Mac"" on one girl. Oh, and Lily-that's my leg. What's so special about the roof? Solid plan, my little friend. But may I suggest one little modification. That foxy young thing you were chatting up, take her up to the roof and have s*x with her! Crazy monkey-style. Should be the plan, I mean look at her. Ted, look at her. She's smokin'! Exactly! Ted, let's wrap. Statistic, at every New York party there's always a girl who has no idea whose party she's at. She knows no one you know, and you will never see her again. Do you see-where I'm going-hu-with this? Aargh! (Pulls down imaginary scope) Scoping, beep, scoping, beep! beep, beep, beep, beep. Target acquired! And now it's time we play a little game I like to call ""Have You Met Ted?""  Hi! Have you met Ted? Do you know Marshall? Lily? Hmm, do you know anyone at this party? Excuse me, (to group) Anyone know a Carlos? On a silver platter! Bon appetite! Your loss, her gain. (To Tatiana) Excuse me, can I show you the roof? It's magical up there! Dude, Robin's not coming. Oh, you were so right about the roof. The roof. The roof is on fire, Ted! Girl from last night, took her back to my place then this morning took her outside, spun her around a couple of times sent her walking-she will never find her way back and there she is. How did she get here? Did you invite her? She said she works with Carlos, who's Carlos? Grr. (Turns around) Hi, you. You're back. ""sweetie""? Really? (They walk into the kitchen Barney mouths) Sweetie? So, it's over between me-and-works with Carlos girl. Yeah, I was trying to think what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met? I think I'm in love with you. Thanks, bro (walks away) Oh, this is lame. lame. Of course. Who? Who invited you? No one even know who you are! Who is Carlos!? Yeah well, ""the one"" is heading up to ""the roof"". (Robin leaves to the roof with Carlos) Unbelievable. That is just a recipe for disaster, they work together (Carlos and Tatiana are making out) Oh, please, what does Carlos have that I don't? I'm not sure I like her."
20,1,2,barney and ted, Ohhh.
21,1,2,cameraman ,We're clear
22,1,2,carlos ,"Carlos (shake hands) Hey, no sweat hombre."
23,1,2,crowd ," No, no."
24,1,2,daughter ,"You were telling us how you met mom. Oh, Dad."
25,1,2,fantasy girl, Thank you.
26,1,2,leroy ,You're all sweaty!
27,1,2,lily ,"Look who I ran into! What? Fine! So what do we think of Ted? But that's part of his charm. Are you kidding? This flapper-for knocks.  Oops... Did you guys get high? You waited five minutes to tell me that? that's great, Ted. You'll be the most ""Casual"" stalker ever. Hey, I'm just sitting here. Wearing my ring... my beautiful ring. Kind of makes wearing other stuff seem wrong. Like my shirt. Kind of don't wanna wear my shirt anymore. Or... my underwear. Oh-that's right-I'm not wearing any. Not slightly. Oh, the moon, the stars, the shimmering skyline. You can't not fall in love on that roof. Man you're a dork. No. At least it was a great party. Answer it! Oh! I'm the luckiest girl alive (runs into bedroom. Marshall strips.) Hey little old books. Ready for a little fifteen minute recess? Okay, buddy, time for the ""tough-talk"". Robin seems great. But let's look at the facts, you wanna get married and right now there's a million women in New York looking for exactly you, but Robin ain't one of them. Stop the tape, rewind-play it again."
28,1,2,lily and marshall, (Gloating) The roof.
29,1,2,lily and ted, I will not have s*x with Marshall.
30,1,2,marshall ,"So you're not goanna call her? You went from, ""I think I'm in love with you"" to ""I'm not gonna call her?"" So're you gonna ask her out? We're having a party next Friday? Alright-so call her up! Baby, no. I have a twenty-five paged paper on unconstitutional law due on Monday, I barely started,  No underwear? Hello? No, no I'm just writing my paper. Hitting the books. So, Gatsby, what are you goanna do when Robin shows up? We do it up there sometimes. I ate like four whole cans of dip! What are you doing to me, man. I got a paper to write. TED! TED WAIT-GET FRENCH ONION. (Closes door) Can you believe this guy, I got a paper to write. (Lily smiles) Okay, fine-(they walk into the bedroom) but it's gotta be like super quick. And no cuddling after. Alright. Sorry, Ted. (Goes up) Alright, we threw two parties. Everybody had fun. Everybody wanged, everybody chunged. Now the kid has got to get to work, and the kid is not to be disturbed. Repeat after me, ""I will not have s*x with Marshall"". Sorry, baby, I gotta work. I need all my blood (points to brain) up here. Has anybody seen an introduction to contract work institution statutes from 1865 to 1923? (Silence) Anybody seen a big-ass book? Okay, where the hell is my-OHH! (Book has been used as coaster, all wet) Okay, introduction to contract work institution statutes from 1865 to 1923...is not a coaster! Ted! I'm jeopardizing my law career so that you can throw not one, not two, but three parties for some girl that you just met who's probably not gonna show up. (Ted's shocked) I mean where is she, Ted, huh? Where's Robin? (Finds Robin) Hi! Hi Robin. (Throws book on the floor and grabs Lily for s*x) What are you gonna do? Dude, you're talking to the kid. I'm goanna knock back this beer. I'm gonna knock back one more beer. I'm gonna go home, I'm gonna write a twenty-five page paper. I'm gonna hand it in and I'm gonna get a A. My name is Rufus, and that's the Trufus."
31,1,2,narrator ,"Okay, where was I? Right, so (While Flashbacks take place) back in 2005 when I was twenty-seven, my two best friends got engaged. And it got me thinking, ""Maybe I should get married."" Then I saw... Robin. She was incredible. I just knew I had to meet her. That's where your Uncle Barney came in. So I asked her out, and I know this sounds crazy... but after just one date, I was in love with her, which made me say something stupid Nothing. I mean, I made a complete fool of myself. So... a week went by and I decided not to call her. Now ever since Marshall put that ring on her finger, Lily had been...well... extra affectionate. She didn't show up. She didn't show up. So I threw a third party for Robin. On a Sunday night (Very Little people in the apartment) He got a B Minus. But still-twenty-five pages in one night, B minus? The kid was good."
32,1,2,robin ,"What? Hey! Uh... since about (points to glass) here. Lily recognized me from the news and-(Lily and Marshall kiss) Hello, Sailor! Well, I should get back to the station. See you guys. (Marshall raises a hand while still kissing Lily) Nice seeing you, Ted.  Ted's something else. Comes on a little strong. Oh, totally. I mean, he's sweet, he's charming, he's just looking for something a little bit more serious than I am. I mean the most I can handle right now is something casual. This just stays between us, right?  Thanks Bill, I'm reporting from the Razzle Dazzle Supermarket on 75th in Columbus where four year old, Leroy Ellensburg, climbed inside a grab a prize machine (You see child stuck in toy machine) and gotten stuck. And on the pursuit of a stuffed purple giraffe. (Ted appears behind her, leaves nervously) From Metro News One, I'm Robin Scherbatsky. (News report ends)  Thanks. (Notices Ted) Ted? What are you doing here? Yeah, kid stuck in a crane machine, how sweet of you to call it news. Oh, I'm going back home next weekend. It's too bad it's not tonight.  I'm so sorry I missed your party.  Robin.  no I got stuck at work, but they finally got that kid out of the crane machine.  Yeah, they let him keep all the toys. He was in there a long time and little kids have smaller bladders.  I wish your party was tonight.  Hi, Ted.  It's Robin.  I totally wanted to come; I got stuck at work again. I feel like I live there. I'm sorry I missed your party...again.  I guess there's no change your two-dayer turned into a three-dayer.  Wow, okay-well I'll be there. so you threw all these parties for me? Hey. Well, here I am.  you're not crazy. I-I don't know, Ted, I mean we barely know each other and you're looking at me with that look and it's like-(struggles) like-let's fall in love, and get married and have kids and drive them to soccer practice.  It's a great look. But you're looking at the wrong girl. Yes, you are. I don't wanna get married right now, maybe ever and if we got together I'd feel like I'd either have to marry you or break your heart and-I just couldn't do either of those things. Just like you can't turn off the way you feel.  What? There's no off switch.  no, it's not. No (smiles)...it's-not.  me too. we could be friends (shrugs) look, I know it sounds insincere when people say that but... we could. You're not a jackass. I'm sorry. I only moved here in April and I'm always working and-I just haven't met a lot of good people so far. But I understand. yeah. (sighs) That sounds good. I'll see you, Ted. (walks away)  I'd like that. a date tonight?  a date tonight? (smiles) I'll help carry. You know something, Ted? You are a catch. You're gonna make some girl very happy, and I am going to help you find her. Hi, Have you met Ted?"
33,1,2,son ,In excruciating detail... So then what happened?
34,1,2,tatiana ,"No. Hi. No. (smiles) I work with Carlos. Sure (Smiles) I sure am (kisses Barney). Come on, sweetie, I need a drink. What? Hello, Barney. You look well. Isn't it weird they invited both of us? I understand you're hurt, but, you don't have to be cruel. Carlos was right about you."
35,1,2,ted ,"No, no, no-we're not playing ""Have you Met Ted!"" I think I'm in love with you. I wasn't in love with her, okay? I was briefly in love with the abstract idea of getting married! That had absolutely nothing to do with Robin. (Finds Lily and Robin chatting at a table.) Robin! Since when do you guys know each other? They just got engaged. Yeah, you too. (Robin leaves, Barney walks closer) Damn it. I'm in love with her. I don't know! I just have this feeling. She's the future Mrs. Ted Mosby. Lily, you squeaked? She said something about me didn't she? Come on, spill it, Red. Huh... I'm gonna spin that as good. Lots of guys are ""something"", I'm ""something else"". But...that's part of my charm. She wants casual. Okay, I'll be casual. I'm gonna be a mushroom cloud of casual. You know why? Cause it's a game! I wanted to skip to the end and do the ""happily ever after"" thing but you don't get there unless you play the game. Yeah-No! I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out I'm asking her out. So how do I ask her out, without asking her out? (thinks) I got it! I don't ask her out... I invite her to our party next Friday. We are now-Casual No-calling's not casual! I just gotta bump into her somewhere. If only I knew her schedule I could arrange a ""chance"" encounter. Guys, boundaries! There she is! 75th in Columbus. (Gets up and grabs coat) Game on! (Leaves)  Robin, wow! What are the odds? Oh, you know, just-uh-Shopping for-uh-dip (holds dip) I love dip... I mean I don't love dip, I like dip. As a friend, you know. So-uh-hey, you-uh-reporting a news story or something? (puts dip back) Wow, kid in a crane machine (approached machine. To boy) You just had to have that toy didn't ya? Couldn't play the game like everyone else. Cute kid (wipes forehead) Um yeah it's f-it's so funny running into your we're having a party next Friday if-if you like swinging by! But, you know, whatever.  It is, it's tonight. This Friday, Did I say next Friday? Yeah-sorry-cuz I've been saying ""next Friday"" all week, but yeah it's tonight. The-uh-party's tonight. But, you know, whatever.  hey, am I interrupting anything? (Holding party mixes)  Yeah, well you and Lily might wanna put some clothes on. We're throwing a party in two hours. Okay, bye (hangs up) Okay, I got it all planned out. She steps through the door, and where's Ted? Not eagerly waiting by the door. Nah I'm across the room at my drafting table showing some foxy young thing all my cool architecture stuff. So Robin strolls over and I casually give her one of these, ""Hey, what's up?"" She says, ""Hey, nice place"" etcetera, etcetera. And then I say, ""Well make yourself at home,"" and I casually return to my conversation. Then, an hour later, ""Oh, you're still here?"" I say like I don't really care, but it's a nice surprise. And then very casually, ""Wanna see the roof?"" Get her up to the roof and the roof takes care of the rest. We're the same height. That's not the plan. Yeah, but she's not Robin. Barney, I don't wanna say- No, come on not this. Hi. No. I don't think so. Whoa-whoa-Hey hey. I got that roof reserved! Hey, she's goanna show up. (Silence) She'll show up. You always know what to say old friend. It's Robin. No, no, no. Not right away. I gotta seem casual. (Answers phone) Hello? Who is this? Merideth? Oh, Robin! Hey, yeah, guess you never showed up did you? Did he get to keep the purple giraffe?  It is the party's tonight. (Marshall's mad) Yeah-uh-it's a two day party. Because that's just how we roll. Uh-so if you wanna swing by its-uh-you know, Casual. See ya. (hangs up) So that was Robin. I know I'm sorry. It's terrible (grabs coat) I'll buy more dip (runs out) I have no idea who that is. I don't know any Carlos. Whoa-Whoa rabbits! Come on, I got that roof reserved. Oh, that was fast. (straight-faced) Glad I could help. What the-no, no, no, no-come on! Great! What am I going to do when Robin shows up. (Silence) She'll show up. It's Robin. (sighs. Answers) Hello? Amanda? Oh, Denise-Sorry you totally sounded like Amanda (Does weird hand thing with Marshall) Oh, Robin-(laughs)-Hi. Hey, ain't no thing but a chicken wing mamacita. (To Lily and Marshall) WHO AM I?  It did indeed, the party continues tonight. (Marshall grabs for him, Ted runs away) Yeah. Last night people were like, ""KEEP IT GOIN' BRO! PARTY TRIFECTA!"" Great, see you tonight. (hangs up. Looks to Marshall) So that was Robin. lame or ""Casual""? Or ""Casual""? No! Oh you thought that-oh, no! I c-okay yes. You got me-I-(laughs)-one of the reasons I threw these parties was so that I could introduce you to uh-(Barney throws Ted a random guy) this guy. I figured, you know, since it didn't work out between us and now we can just laugh about it (nervously laughs)-Anyway Robin, this is. She's still talking to Carlos. I can still win this, it's not over. She's not just ""one of them"" she's the one. Nothing. It's a game, I gotta just-keep playing it. Hey. Carlos, can you give us a minute? Robin, look I didn't invite you to this party to set you up with Carlos. Or the one before that. Or the one before that. (Robin smiles) I threw these parties because I wanted to see you. There's something here, look, unless I'm crazy. Like what? I'm not gonna force sports on them unless they're interested. No, I'm not.  Click. Off. Let's make out. What? That was the off switch! And I turned it off. I mean sure yes, I wanna fall in love get married blah, blah, blah, but-on the other hand... you... me...the roof. There is an off switch... and it's off.  yes, it is. (They draw closer) Yes-it is (they kiss long) No it's not. You're right, there's no off switch. God I wish there was an off switch. So (They mutter together. Then laugh) Oh (clutches heart) I don't know, Robin. I made such a jackass out of myself here, every time we start hanging out it'll be like, ""Oh-that's right-I'm a jackass."" Well-uh-maybe in a few months after it's not so fresh, we could all-uh...you know, get a beer. Or, you know-now. (Robin looks at Ted) We could all get a beer now. My friends are goanna love you-like you-you know, as a friend. (Robin giggles) Jackass. You jealous? Hey, don't you have a paper to write? I know it. At least let me buy you a beer. Come on I'll buy everyone a beer. What?  Well, good luck. I mean maybe New York's just too big a town, you know? There's millions of people in this city. How in all this mess is a guy supposed to find the love of his life? I mean, where do you even begin?  Hi, I'm Ted (Robin takes the beer to the table. Ted watches her while the Cute Girl talks to him. Robin looks back. Smiles. Ted engages into a conversation)"
36,1,2,,"Marshall, Lily and Ted: Ohh!! Mashall, Lily and Ted: Ohh!!"
37,1,3,barney ," MacLaren's is bore, snore. Ted, tonight we're going to go out. We're going to meet some ladies. It's going to be legendary. Phone-five! (High-fives the phone) You didn't phone-five did you? I know when you don't phone-five, Ted. Come on, we always go to MacLaren's. MacLaren's is this much fun. What I'm offering is the chance to have this much fun. This hand gesture thing doesn't really work on the phone, does it? Get in the cab. Marshall you too. I understand. (To Ted) Get in the cab. Uhh... because he's getting laid. (Doing ""I see you"" hand motion) Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here. You keep going to the same bar, you're in a rut and I am a rut buster. I'm going to bust your rut (Smiles). Ted, what's the first syllable in rutting (trying to make it sound like ""routine"". Ted gives in and jumps in the cab) Peace out, suckers. (Cab speeds off.) First we got to pick someone up at the airport.  Estaban, doors! (Cab doors lock) Just this one little thing and the rest of the night is ours. I don't know. Maybe her? Or her.  Scenario. Couple of girls fly into town, looking for a fun weekend in NYC when they meet two handsome international business men just back from a lucrative trip to Japan. Sample dialogue, ""You have a wheelie bag? Wh... I have a wheelie bag!"" False. Sidebar, tuck in your shirt. You look sketchy. Trust me, it's going to be legendary. We're building an igloo in Central Park. It's gonna be legendary. Snow suit up! Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here! This is happening. Now you can either put your bags on the carousel now, or you can listen to me give you a really long speech convincing you to put the bags on the carousel. Your move. (Silence) Ted, since the dawn of time mankind has struggled... (Ted puts bags on carousel) Okay, carousel four is tapped out. Ready? Because I'm about to drop some knowledge. Cute girls are not from Buffalo. Time-out. Ten o'clock. You ready to rock this, Tedder? Ted, you klutzy, great guy, you! (Barney shoves Ted into two lady's cart and Ted trips backwards. To Women) Hey, Barney. (Adjusts tie) Philly? That's where we're headed! Yes, you will. (Girls leave. To Ted) Follow them, tickets on me. Hey, is that Marshall? (Takes Phone) Marshall, stop whatever you're doing, get in that hoopty-ass Vierro of yours and come meet us in Philly. It's going to be legendary. Yeah, yeah, yeah... I sent you some pictures on my phone, check it. (Pictures show Barney doing ""I see you"" hang gesture) Philly! (Hangs up. To Ted) Admit it, you're having fun. This much fun. Thirty-five thousand feet of fun! Let's go talk to those girls. Ted, you've been living your whole life in a seatbelt. It's time to unclick. (Unclicks)  Yeah, sorry, sorry.  No! No! The night is just started. Look, airport bar. Flight attendants! They'll get your tray table at its full upright position. Say what? (Goes for a high five) Don't say you're going to k*ll someone in front of airport security, not cool. (To security) Not cool. This is an outrage. We are international businessmen on an international business trip. I demand you release us immediately.  Those bags were your responsibility.  Please. (Silence) We are international businessmen. My colleague accidentally left the bags there now please let us go before we miss our international business meeting. Believe it or not, that duff bag thing worked. We are international businessmen... Dude, seriously, relax. Exactly! (To Ted) We have a lawyer? Relax, Ted. We didn't do anything wrong. And, B.T.W, we'd be out of here by now if you'd have tucked in your shirt. (Ted turns his head to face away from Barney)  We're going to Sascha's? Sascha. (Points to Security Woman) She's having friends over for drinks at her house. It's goanna be legen... wait for it...and I hope you're not lactose intolerant 'cuz the second half of that word is... dairy. Legendary!  Marshall, we're going to Sascha's!  Ted, Ted, Ted. (Does I'm watching you hand gesture) Yes, we are. So, uh... you're Sascha's friends, huh? Philly!  Philly!  Did you hear that, Ted? Dana works security at the Liberty Bell. Wow it must be really well cornered off over there. You ever go behind the rope and touch it? Ever, like, stick your head inside it? D'you ever lick it? Hmm... I bet nobody in history has ever licked the Liberty Bell! If someone were to pull that off I dare say it would be... what's the word? Legendary, Ted, LEGENDARY! Could have licked the Liberty Bell. Bong, bong... Ted, Ted... you're not even looking. Look, our forefathers died for the pursuit of happiness, okay. Not for the sit around and wait of happiness. Now if you want, you can go to the same bar, drink the same beer talk to the same people everyday, or you can lick the Liberty Bell! You can grab life by the crack and lick the crap out of it! Thanks, Leonard. Ted, you're missing out on a valuable life lesson! No, it has to be the two of us. Because, you're my best friend, alright? You don't have to tell me I'm yours. But the way I see it, we're a team. Without you, I'm just the dynamic uno. You know what, fine. If you wanna go home... then we'll go home. Good, (smiles) 'cuz we're here! (Hops out)"
38,1,3,carl ,"Compliments of that guy. Oh, for you it's six dollars."
39,1,3,cute girl," What?  (laughs) My, god. Did you guys really do that?"
40,1,3,dana ,"You know it.  I do okay. Only all the time. Yeah. Nope, I have never licked it."
41,1,3,daughter ,"You sure spend a lot of time in bars... So, that girl you were talking to... that was mom?"
42,1,3,derrick ,"Hey. Yeah, I'm gay. Just came over to let you know that you sat on a grape. (Lily peels squished grape off her dress) I'll get some Club Soda for that stain. (Leaves)  Hey, I got that Club Soda. Let's see that booty. (Lily bends over for him to clean the stain, Marshall walks in) It's okay, man... You don't say!"
43,1,3,fight attendant," (Walks by) Sir, seatbelt light's on."
44,1,3,laura ,"Oh, my god. (To Ted) Are you okay? It's fine, oh, you were a little shaky on your landing. I'd give you a 9.2. (Laughs) Laura. (Shaking hand) Look I'm really sorry that we have to hit and run but we've got a plane to catch. (Looks to friend, Tatiana) Philadelphia. You are? Well...uh...guess we'll see you on the plane. We're visiting our boyfriends.  Isn't that great.  Aren't they cute? They're both linebackers for the Eagles."
45,1,3,lily ," Let's go to MacLaren's. I'm so glad we finally get to hang out just the two of us! You sure you're okay giving up your Friday night to hang with an old almost-married lady? Unless it's the end of the night, then you get on anything. Really? Sweet. I guess that's one drawback to being engaged. I'm sure that's why he didn't...  Oh. Oh, hello! So I grew up in Park Slope.  Heyow. Oh, believe me I've been there. I have this line that I use when guys come (Guy#3 walks by) Check it out. You take this one, I'll save it for the next one.  You're going to Philly? Why...  Well it sounds like you're having a lot more fun than I am. I'm just talking to guys' backs while they hit on Robin.  Don't you bet I get that a lot?  Oh, of course, that's it the ring! I guess I'm not used to it yet.  I'm not going to take off my ring! Wouldn't you be jealous of guys swarming all over my beeswax?  Bye. Robin! Robin. (Waves her left hand ridiculously to show that she has no ring. Robin walks over) Hey, I'm over here.  No, this place is great (positions mouth in an inviting kiss position) What? My lips are always like this (drinks martini and drops it all over her blouse) Really. Yeah, yeah...booth (throws purse to Robin, spots a man. Robin leaves to booth. Man walks up to Robin.)  Hey. (Silence) I'm engaged, sorry. (Puts ring on) I took my ring off! It's very, very sweet of you to come over and talk to me, but I... just... Oh, damn it! (Takes ring off and places it in her pocket, upset) Just fending up the advances of that totally hot guy.  Oh, I know that guy is gay. Just Marshall and I have been together for nine years. I haven't been single since high school. I guess I wanted to throw this net back into the ocean and see how many fish I could catch. So far, one. One gay dolphin. (Smiles) You're right I know. Hey do you wanna get some coffee and have an actual conversation? Oh, thank you so much. Marshall, no. Marshall, he's gay! Hey!"
46,1,3,marshall ,"You guys talking to each other? Nobody's listening. Oh, I wish I could... I think Lily and I are just goi... Consistently.  Studyin' law. Making a responsible choice for my future... on a Friday Night. Bein' a lawyer had better be awesome. (on Phone. Singing) What's up, Ted?  Yeah.  That is awesome.  Man, I wish I could, guys, but...  I...I didn't ask.  Ouff, yeah... I bet she gets that a lot.  Not with a ring on your finger. I mean, you know, guys see the ring and it's like Cha-Chung! Marshall parking only.  Oh, it's totally the ring. If you took that ring off your finger, you'd have a ton o' guys crowding around your junk.  G-g-g-going to Philly!  But we're on an adventure!  Fine! (Hangs up)  Listen to me, you're both American citizens. Don't let them pull any patriot-act voodoo. You both retain the right to refuse to answer any questions without an attorney present so don't say anything until I get there, alright? Okay, goodbye (Hangs up. Sings) To Philly! The adventure continues! Destroy!  Man, I'm almost half way there!  Can't we just... just...  Legendary, that sounds awesome! (On Phone. Sighs) Fine. (Beep) Hold on I have another call. (Presses button) Hello.  Sorry, Buddy, two against one. (hangs up)  Robin! Uh... Where's Lily  Is she talking to some hot guy? Oh, you can tell me. It's totally cool. It was my idea! Hell, I told her she could take the ring off.  No! Don't interrupt it's awesome. So the rings really off, huh? (Realizing what he's done) It's awesome... Well just tell her I called and... tell her that... she's awesome. (Hangs up. Sings dryly) Really, really awesome. Our relationship is built on mutual trust. (Dryly) I can't breathe! Baby, please don't ever take that ring off again. No matter how awesome I say that it is. BACK OFF HOMBRE. I'm not that afraid to fight you. You wanna test this guy? Be my guest! Oh, thank god... I've never been in a fight before. (hugs him)"
47,1,3,mashall ," Oh yeah, you know me, I'm the jealous type. Any groom so much as look at you, I'm a sack him in the kisser, no seriously, you girls have a good time tonight. (hangs up)"
48,1,3,narrator ,"So there was this one night, before I met your mother when I really wanted to go to the bar. Well that's just what we did back then. Me. Marshall and Lily. Barney We all used to hang out at this one bar called ""MacLaren's"". But then one night. I had no idea why I hung out with Barney. That night, Marshall had a ton of studying to do. So Lily went out with Robin who was new to New York and looking for a friend. So there we were, stuck on a plane to Philadelphia with two very unsingle girls. All thanks to your Uncle Barney. So, Barney and I hit the town. Philadelphia, PA. Our first and only stop... Sascha's party. Back at the bar, the girls night out wasn't going as Robin had hoped. (Cell Phone rings) So it turns out Uncle Marshall really was the jealous type. Unfortunately, that guys boyfriend... also the jealous type. We really did and that was when I realized why I hung out with Barney. I never got where I thought I wanted to go, but I always got a great story. Kids, every story in a man's life is like a dot in an impressionist's painting. And when you... Yeah, that's a no. (Kids are fed up) What? Come on!"
49,1,3,officer mcneil," Passengers Mosby and Stinson? Please come with us, gentlemen. Keep your hands where I can see them.  Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to remain calm.  We got footage of you placing two bags on JFK carousel three, and abandoning them to purchase a last minute flight with cash.  Sir, please. We're assessing the bag situation.  Can't remember the last time I saw an international business man with an untucked shirt. In addition, we received this footage taken over the last few months.  Nobody's that lame.  Sir! Lower your voice or we'll restrain you.  Go ahead, JFK... what is the baggage status?  You're free to go."
50,1,3,robin ,"Yeah. Oh please, I'm so sick of the ""meet-market"" scene. Guys are like a subway. You miss one, another one comes along in five minutes. Heyow! Oh, I love Park Slope. When did you move to Manhattan?  Uh, no she is. (Points to Lily) Yeah, I'm a ghost! Died fifteen years ago, like that pickup line. God, I'm so sorry. It's ridiculous in here, why don't we go somewhere else? What are you doing? With your lips and everything...? Ooh, look a booth opened up. Yeah, I thought we could finally go talk, and you're not listening to me, so I'm going to walk away. (notices Lily is busy staring at a stranger)  Lily's phone.  She's uh...  Really? Well I thought it was kinda weird, but if you're cool with it. Yeah. It's off and she's talking to some guy. Do you want me to go over and...  Lily, I thought tonight was about us hanging out, what are you doing? Dude, I think that guy is gay. You wanna be single? (Laughs) You wanna fight off loser guys all night, does that seem like fun to you? And Marshall. Lily, all these girls here tonight are looking to catch what you've already got. If, by ""Coffee"" you mean ""Cheesecake"", then yes."
51,1,3,sascha ," You guys, keep the volume down. You're goanna wake my grandpa. Who wants hard lemonade? (They all take some) Shh!"
52,1,3,son ,The bar? Big surprise! So that's a no?
53,1,3,tatiana ,I think Chris is going to propose this weekend!
54,1,3,ted ," Why don't we go to MacLaren's? What's wrong with MacLaren's? Yeah, cause MacLaren's is fun... See, you say that. You say it's going to be this much fun. But most of the time it ends up being this much fun. This much fun is good! It's safe. It's guaranteed! No it doesn't. Why can Marshall say no? It's not a rut, okay. It's a routine and I like it! Alright, so what's this legendary plan. Okay, I'm outta here. Why do you have those suitcases, and who are we picking up? Wait so when you said you were going to ""pick someone up at the airport"". You meant you were going to ""pick someone up at the airport"". You've gotta be kidding me. I'm sketchy? Don't say ""legendary"", okay? You're too liberal with the word legendary.  So...uh, did you just get in from Detroit? (Points to self) Japan. (Woman leaves) Alright, um, I think we need to refine our back-story first. How did we... I... I'm so sorry. So, hi... I'm Ted. Oh, where're you headed? No, Barney. Don't you get on that escalator! And don't you dare get on that subsequent escalator!  Are you alright?  Hey, guess where I am? I'm on a... ready? Plane to... ready?...Philadelphia. Well I didn't think we'd be on a flying to Philadelphia when I woke up this morning, I'll give you that. Whoa, whoa, whoa, the seatbelt light is on. So what brings you guys to Philly?  So great. Both? (To Barney) Both of their boyfriends are linebackers.  Marshall, don't come to Philly.  We're on a Tarmac in Philadelphia, crazy adventure. Barney, I am going to k*ll you. You demand!? No, no, no, no, no... he does not demand. We... we... we have no demands!  Okay, yeah. I'm calm... I'm totally calm. They were your bags. Look, this is all just... it's a misunderstanding. Truth is, my friend... he does this thing where he goes to airports with fake luggage to pick up girls and we followed some here to Philadelphia. That's it! That's all this is! Yes, he's that lame. Tell them you're that lame! OH COME ON! We at least get to call our lawyer. You had to play the race card.  Don't come to Philly.  Yeah, we just got released and we're heading back on the next flight. Meet us at MacLaren's maybe we can still make last call.  No, we can't just... we're going home! Who the hell is Sascha? No.  No, Marshall, we're going back. No, we're not. (Decides he's going to leave) Well, this is my stop. Barney, I'm going to the airport. Sascha, thank you... and uh... tell your grandpa I'm sorry I walked in on him in the bathroom. (Leaves) We're going to the airport. Why do I hang out with you? Why? All I wanted was to have a regular beer, in a regular bar with my regular friends, in my regular city! No, I'm not. Look, I don't need you to teach me how to live, okay. I know how to live. If you want to go lick the Liberty Bell just go lick it yourself. Why? Why do you need me? Fine...we'll go lick the Liberty Bell!  I had no idea how Barney redirected the cab without me knowing, but we got out, Dana let us in and by god we licked the Liberty Bell. And you know what it tastes like? Freedom... No actually it tasted like pennies."
55,1,3,,"Guy#1: Hey. Guy#2: (Interrupts. To Robin) You're from Park Slope. Guy#2: (Ignoring Lily) So where're you from? Heaven. Guy#3: (To Robin) Hey. b*mb Squad Guy: They're clean. It's just a whole bunch of condoms... and a power bar. Cabdriver#2: That was beautiful, man!"

57,1,4,barney ,"Booger. Not some stupid word, ""Booger"". What? Journalist? You do the little fluff pieces at the end of the news. Old people, babies, monkeys... that's not journalism, that's just things in a diaper. Of course not, because now you're saying ""Nipple"" and it's a hundred! (Whispers) Step into my web. Hold up, there are only two reasons to date a girl you've already dated. Breast, Implants. You dumped a p*rn star? Friendship over (gets up) FRIENDSHIP OVER! There she is. Hey is it cold in here, because I can kind of see Robin's nickels? Now for your next challenge... Oh, search your soul, Robin. You and I both know this wasn't about the money. Sure, Metro News One pays you jack and hey, a little green salad on the side's good for you, me and Mr. McGee. Well baby really likes, is the thrill of pulling one over on those bean counters, who under appreciate you and still haven't promoted you. And for two more hundy-sticks, baby's going to look in the camera and say this (Whispers in her ear) Did you sleep with her sister? Sleep with her mom? I'm losing interest in your story. Know, that was a big mistake, Ted. You should've done it in person. Desperate ""Please-don't-leave-me"" s*x is amazing. You know what else? My younger sister just got married and I'm about to turn thirty-sex. Fantastic. You know, that Natalie... she's good times. She's probably on the subway by now. You could call her Voice Mail. Beep, dumped. Click. Done! Mm... Mm! Six words! You... look... fat... in... those... jeans..., you're free to go. Seriously, honey, men are working, here. And great TV was had by all. Alright Scherbatsky, new challenge. And this one's big. But so, is the cash reward. For one thousand dollars, you heard me, all you have to do is get up there on the news and do one of these... (does odd dance) And as you do it, you say this, ""Elbert Ickey Woods. The bangles were fools to cut you in '91. Your 1521 rushing yards and your 27 touch downs will not be forgotten. So Coach Dave Shullah, screw you and your crappy steakhouse."" Ahh! This is it.  Everyone, everyone... If I may direct your attention to the television. You're about to see something... amazing. Come on, baby... bring it home. No, Marshall. That was beyond my wildest dreams (Robin's wailing on TV) But isn't it nice to know that people are watching? Hey, Ted, you know what always picks me up when I'm down? Other people's misfortune. You missed something so amazing. Fine."

59,1,4,henry ," Well...  And them, in '72, Mickey Mantle rode my cab for the fourth time.  But the most exciting moment, that would have to be this one, right now.  Look at me, I'm on TV. I never thought I'd have my story told. Thank you, Miss Robin Scherbatsky. Thank you."

(Laughs) Booger. Seriously, who talks like that? Eew. I'm just assuming. Bye. Hey, Ted. Nice shirt! Is it yesterday already? Why would Natalie hang up on you? Well, you must have done something. Why did you guys break up? Uh-huh.  Uh-huh... So you dumped her right before her birthday?  Never...break...up...with...a...girl...on...her...birthday! Well, did she cry her eyes out? How do you n...Oh, you didn't!  On...her...answering...machine!? And...on...her... birthday? Oh... who... breaks... up... with... somebody... on... their... answering... machine... on... their... birthday?! Not exactly the point I was trying to make, Marshall. That is a terrible way to break up with someone.  Hi, Marshall, it's Lily. We're not going have s*x for at least a month. But you're awesome. Okay bye-bye. (Hangs up) Thank you. Well guess what? She cried! You just didn't have the sack to face those tears. Yeah, Ted, hold on to that one.  Why... couldn't... you... leave... that... poor... girl... alone? Oh, that's such a cliché. Well, I think Natalie deserves better. Ted, have you considered telling her the truth? Ted, what is the truth? Why do you want to break up with her? So, tell her that. Why? What is so horrible about that? Yeah, you have better chances of winning the lottery. Yeah, and he's going to sit there and he's going to take it like a man. Slow loves junk Oh, boy, here we go. What happened to you? Oh, well you did the right thing. I'm proud of you. Are you okay?"
62,1,4,marshall ,"Hot top, Bro, is it new? You're finally gonna watch ""Goonies AGAIN? Slow love, Chuck"". What about that chick...um...Jackie? He wasn't ready for a commitment. Uh-oh. Yeah, dude, email! Okay, in my client's defense. Is there an unterrible way to break up with somebody? No. Personally I'd rather hear the bad news on an answering machine than face the humiliation in person. (Lily Picks up her phone) It's the least painful way you can do it. Who are you calling? Dude, what's Krav Maga? Yeah, she's like the best girl you've dated in years. I don't get it, man, Natalie is awesome. Ineffable... good word. So when are you going to do it? ""I'm not ready for a commitment."" It's not a cliché, it's a classic. It's the stairway to heaven of breakup lines. Better. There's no better in breaking up. There's only less awful. A cliché's a cliché for a reason. It's comforting. No, no. We're going to get you out of this. Okay, how about... ""It's not you it's me""? Oh, you can't tell her that. That's horrible. Alright, man, tell her the truth. She's goanna cry. You planned that? Oh, my god. Are you alright? Oh, man."
63,1,4,marshall and ted, Natalie!
64,1,4,narrator ,"Kids, when you're single all you're looking for is happily ever after. But only one of your stories can end that way. The rest end with someone getting hurt. This is one of those stories, and it starts... with a shirt. Just listen... Because none of this would have happened if it hadn't have been for that shirt. Natalie, I had so many fond memories of her. The tea candles on her dresser. The sock monkey collection on her bed. That one Belle and Sebastian song that she always listened to. Her smile. That's when Robin realized, no one, not even her boss, watched Metro News One. So, Natalie and I started dating again and just like that it all came back. The tea candles. The Sock monkeys. Belle and Sebastian... all of it. It seemed like happily ever after wasn't far off. So the next night I took Natalie out to dinner. To do the mature thing. And right then, Aunt Robin realized how important her job truly was. Remember when Natalie said. Turns out Krav Maga is not a kind of yoga. It's a form of gorilla street fighting developed by the Israeli army. And that's how it ended with Natalie. No happily ever after. Just a whole lot of hurt. And just like that all those wonderful memories were replaced. By this one But you know, bad as that night was... within a year Natalie was married. With three beautiful children. So that's the up side of her. Sometimes it happens for a reason. Is that all you're taking away from this story? Hey, she knew Krav Maga."
65,1,4,natalie ,"Hello? Go to hell. (Hangs up) I have an idea. Why don't you leave a message? OH! Oh yeah? Up yours... three years ago (closes door. Ted opens it)  No you don't. And I suppose you're suddenly ready to get married and settle down? You must think I have absolutely no self respect. Wow. Maybe it was the caffeine, but you really brought your game up to a whole new level. Well I better run, I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour. Thanks honey. Bye, guys. Oh wait, wait. There's something I have to say first. Today at work, I had not one, not two, but three birthday cakes, so tonight; can we just skip the cake? Yeah, no that's okay... I wasn't telling anyone about it. Oh, it's okay. You know you've already given me the best present of all. I can trust again. So, if you ever come to Alabama, my mom throws these huge crawfish boils and she's just dying to meet you, by the way. I'm not the one for you? It's my birthday! It's my birthday and you're telling me I'm not the one for you? Oh, so dating you is like winning the lottery? Okay, So what's the problem? TRY! I'm not ""F-able""? Oh, so I'm stupid? Okay, ""what's going on"" is, you broke my heart over my answering machine... on my birthday, waited three years for me to get over you. Tracked me down, begged me to go out with you again only so you could dump me three weeks later. Again on my birthday! WHAAAT!? I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour."
66,1,4,one guest, Surprise...
67,1,4,producer ,Joel Adam's wants to see you in his office (leaves)
68,1,4,robin ,"Nice shirt! Barney's offering me fifty bucks to say some stupid word on a live news report. But I'm not doing it, I am a journalist. For your information, my boss is about to bump me up to the City Hall beat. So I'm not going to jeopardize my promotion by saying ""Booger"" for fifty bucks. Who's Natalie? Well why'd you guys break up? You wanted to see me, Mr. Adams? City Hall? (Pans In) Oh, my god. So, next time you're passing City Hall, make sure and stop by New York's oldest hotdog cart. Today a delicious hotdog will cost you $2.50, but back when the stand first opened in 1955, you could get one for only a nipple. Reporting live, Robin Scherbatsky, Metro News One. I said, ""Nipple"" on the news! That was so unprofessional! I said, ""Nipple"" on the news! No, there is not going to be another challenge, I don't care how much you offer me.  I gotta get back to work. See ya.  Baby's going to think about it. An occasion that was supposed to be joyous suddenly turned tragic when Ethel and Sadie Marsolis, New York's oldest twins, suddenly passed away on this, the eve of their one hundredth birthday. I'm a dirty, dirty girl (Slaps behind). Ow. Reporting live, Robin Scherbatsky, Metro News One. Before you say anything, I just want to say, I really like working here at Metro News One. What? Take him to the vet? Was that all? And nothing about the twins' story? Want to talk mature? I just wrapped up a live newscast by honking my own boobs. What the hell is that? Just write it down for me. What do I care, it's not like anyone's watching anyway, right? (Sits down) Henry, as New York's oldest handsome cab driver, you've seen quite a lot.  In your past sixteen years on the job what is your most exciting memory?  What? It's an honor to tell your story, Henry.  You know, Metro News One may not be number one in viewer ship. But this reporter takes pride in... (trips and falls off camera) Whoa!! OH! Oh, my god! I'm covered in horse crap! It's in my hair!! Oh my, ow... ow my knee. Please can we please have one person in this whole bar who didn't see it? You saw it?"
69,1,4,son ,"Wow, so you beat up by a girl? You got beat up by a girl?"
70,1,4,stefanie ,"Okay, this is difficult to say, back when I lived in LA, I was pretty broke, so I spent a month making adult films. A-hundred-and-seventy-five."
71,1,4,ted ," Wow. Right? Right? That's the crazy part. I've had this shirt for, like, six years... Until this morning I wasn't into it at all, but now it's like my tastes have changed. Yes, hello, Barney.  Mmm... Who's bourbon is this? Aaah, point is. I seem to like bourbon now. I could have sworn I hated bourbon. First the shirt, now bourbon. I spent twenty-seven years making up my mind about things, right? The movie I saw once in Haden, the city I'll never go back to because it was raining the day I visited. Maybe it's time to start forming some second impressions...  Not Goonies, girls. What if there's someone from my past, who I thought was wrong for me at the time, but in fact she, like my shirt, is actually a perfect fit? Steph... Wow, okay... how many did you make? And my bathing suit had fallen completely off. Uh...no. Man, I haven't seen her in like three years! I just wasn't looking for a big commitment at the time, of course now a big commitment doesn't seem so bad... maybe I should call her? What do you guys think? Found it! I found Natalie's number. Thank you. I am calling her; this is crazy I haven't talked to her in, like, three years. I wonder if she even remembers me. Natalie, its Ted Mosby. She remembers me. I don't know! No. No. And her birthday might have been coming up. Okay, so I didn't wanna get a boyfriend level gift for a girl I was just about to break up with. No, I didn't dump her... right before her birthday. Natalie! Hey, Happy Birthday! Listen... LILY WAIT, THE SHIRT! I KNOW, IT WAS A MISTAKE! I don't know. Natalie! Hey, Happy Birthday! (Scene splits in two to show he's leaving a message on her machine) Listen... you're awesome. You really are... awesome. I'm just like super busy right now, so... maybe we should just... call it a day. But you're awesome. Okay, it was childish and stupid, I just...I didn't want to see her cry. That was me then, okay? This is the new old shirt-wearing, sack-having Ted. I'm gonna make this right. Hi. Natalie. Come on, I just want to say I'm sorry. I only came down here because you wouldn't take my call.  Good one. Okay, fine. I'm just going to leave this sock monkey here (Pretends to walk away) Goodbye. Natalie... I. OKAY, okay... I... look, look. I know you're mad. Happy Birthday (hands her a sock monkey) Three years ago. No, look... I was an idiot for leaving that message. I realize how much that sucked.  Maybe we should just, call it a day? But you're awesome. Okay, bye. (Hangs up) There was a surprise party that night? (Natalie nods) How come nobody told me? People think I can't keep a secret but I totally can! Sorry, not the issue... Look, Natalie, I was just a stupid kid back then, terrified of commitment. Well, yeah, actually (smiling). I'm a different guy now. Give me another chance. Come on... Just a cup of coffee. (Pretending the sock monkey's talking) Please Natalie. Give the guy a chance. (Natalie looks at the sock monkey) Self respect is over-rated! (Monkey raises right arm as though it's a fact. Natalie laughs) Thanks. I did just start subscribing to esquire. They have some helpful columns. The following, is from the October issue. Krav Maga, how cool is it that she does Krav Maga? Hmm... I have no idea. Some kind of yoga? Yeah, I have to break up with her. I know, she's terrific, but I have to break up with her. I know! I hate this. These past three weeks have been great. I should be in love with her, but I'm not feeling that thing. It's ineffable. I have to do this face-to-face. I just... I don't know what I'm going to say! It doesn't matter, I already told her I am ready for a commitment, so... oh, my god... there's no way out... I'm going to have to marry her. The truth? She's not the one. Yeah, what is so horrible about that?...""She's not the one."" Why is that such a heart-breaking thing to hear? The chances of one person being another person's ""The one"" are like six billion to one. Exactly, you wouldn't take it personally if you lost the lottery. I have to do the mature thing. Man, she's gonna cry. Thanks, Lil. Look, uh, Natalie there's something I have to say. Today is your birthday? Today's your birthday! I... I didn't get you anything. You're welcome. (Chugs wine. To waiter) Oh, so much more wine. Look, Natalie, there's something I have to say and there's no good way to say it. I wanna break up. I don't think you're the one for me. I don't want to waste your time because I really like you. I wanna do right by you, and I think the best way to do that is just to be honest. I'm sorry. (Natalie covers her face) Just let it out. They're only tears. (Throws her spaghetti on him) Aah! I'm sorry. I just thought the mature thing to do would be... Yes, I know I didn't realize that it was... It's really not such a big deal. I mean it's the odds. It's like you lost the lottery. No, no, no. I didn't mean that. It's... I can't explain it. It's... ineffable. No, no, no, no. Ineffable, ineffable means it can't be explained. Oh, god what's going on? No, it's... it's not like that. I'm just... it's, it's, it's. I'm just like super busy right now. Told the truth, turns out the truth has a mean round house kick. I'm bleeding internally. I really thought I was going the good way this time. I guess there is no good way. Sometimes no matter how hard you try to do the right thing, you just end up flat on your back flailing around in a big pile of horse crap! It's going against the internet now! It's okay, grow up."
72,1,4,waiter ,This is compliments of those two gentlemen at the bar. (For Robin)
73,1,4,,"Mr. Adams: Come in, (On Phone) Alright, I'll get back to you. (Hangs up) Mr. Adams: Yes, I did. I need you to cover a story. (Nods) It's down at City Hall. Mr. Adams: That's great. So my dog keeps going (Makes three consecutive dog scoffs) Mr. Adams: Well you have dogs, right? What do you... what do you think that means? Mr. Adams: Genius. (Smiles) That's one I owe you. Mr. Adams: Yeah. Mr. Adams: Oh, yeah, great job on that one. New York loves you. You're a superstar, bye-bye. Guy#1: (mimicking) My knee! Guy#2: (mimicking) It's in my hair!"
74,1,5,austin ,"Oh, totally. (High-five) So, Marshall, what about you? You guys thinking house, baby?"
75,1,5,barney ,"""Okay""!? Awesome!! ""Okay"" is the name of a club. Yeah, it's supposed to be incredibly exclusive. This friend of mine once waited outside for two hours, he couldn't get in. No... a friend of mine named, shut up. Yeah, he just wants to show you his own VIP if you know what I mean... All the things you do when you know where the next ten thousand lays are coming from. Translation, she's ugly, she's ugly, she ugs in the ugly. So, do you have any other hot single fr...  And his hair was perfect. One of the twenty-four similarities between girls and fish is that they're both attracted to shiny objects. You really never read my blog, do you? What the hell happened to these two? Wow, who knew being committed in a heterosexual relationship could make a guy so gay. My, oh, my there are some ferocious looking cutlets here tonight. Alright, hookup strategy, colon, find a cutlet; lock her in early, grind with her all night till she's mine. Question is: do these strategies ever not work for me? Either way the answer's ""about half the time"". You think?  Okay, it's a little loud.  Oh hey, I can't see her face. Is she hot? Maybe theres... a machine in... The restroom. Ted, bring your coat, we're leaving. That was my cousin, Leslie. No, no, no... we are not laughing about this, Ted. This is not going to be some funny story that we'll be telling in a couple months. It's not gonna be like, ""Hey, remember that time when you were grinding with... NO! And you know why? Because, italics, this night did not happen. And you promise me that you will never, ever, ever tell another soul what transpired here tonight. You promise. Promise Why, I didn't check a coat. And even if I did, on principle tip jars have become so... FINE! Just... eh. (Leaves) THEY PLAYED SOME GOOD SONGS TONIGHT. WHAT? WHAT? THAT PLACE MAKES GREAT SALADS!"
76,1,5,bartender ," ""34"".  ""34""  ""34!"""
77,1,5,bradley ," Uh... we're her bitches too. (Doorman gives them a look) We'll wait here... Oh yeah, isn't there a third Affleck Brother? Keith Affleck or Brian Affleck or something? Please, please, please. Those were the four greatest and only breasts I have ever seen."
78,1,5,chris ,"Oh, not so fast. In order for the tannins to mellow, you should let it breathe for about thirty minutes. The new album is great; it's all smooth and polished, not all dark and heavy like the early stuff. Five more minutes, we don't want to rush to tannins. Okay, this question is for the wedge. (Takes a question card)"
79,1,5,claire ,"Austin and I spent Saturday night at the most charming bed and breakfast. It was so nice. What did you do this weekend? Ah! (Laugh) I'm three month's pregnant. Oh, yeah. Norah Jones just gets better and better."
80,1,5,coat check girl," No, no, no. Coat wench, I like it. I should get a sign made of it.  Rough night?  Because all of the stuff you're supposed to like... usually sucks. Like these clubs or cruises.  Or the Super Bowl.  The rockettes.  (laughs) You said that already.  Yeah, see, everyone keeps telling you something is supposed to be fun, it's usually not.  Right!  Then we couldn't go anywhere that's supposed to be fun.  Then we'll get our teeth cleaned.  (laughs) Okay."
81,1,5,crowd ,"CHUG, CHUG, CHUG (etc...)"
82,1,5,daughter ,"I know, he's just going to tell us anyway."
83,1,5,kelly ," Totally! (Walks him to the middle of the dance floor and starts dancing)  Sagittarius.  I would love one. Just a beer! (Imitates shooter. Ted mouths ""Oh, okay"" and leaves)"
84,1,5,lily ,"SUCK IT LOSERS! (Burps) You know, quiet time with the fiancé. I don't know, I just felt embarrassed. Claire is my age, and she and her husband do all these classy grownup stuff. Maybe we should start doing some grownup stuff.  Yeah, but it wasn't classy. Maybe we should have a wine tasting party. Oh, no, Ted, your blazer! Somebody spilled gorgeous all over it. Love it! Hey we're wearing the same shirt! Oh, wait no that's just my shirt reflected in yours. Marshall and I are just growing up. Why, you'd rather be out at some dance club, all noisy and sweaty with the... (Imitates music beat). Is that what you want? (Imitates music beat.)  Let's start drinking! Come on, it's not that bad. We're really starting to click with these guys. Claire and Austin just invited us to their fondue fest next Saturday night. It's dipping stuff in hot cheese, what's not to love? Marshall, it's time for us to grow up. Please tell me we can drink the wine now. Freaking tannins. Marshall, are you okay? Taxi! Hey. Marshall just ditched out on our own party. Can you get me in there? I kind of need to k*ll him. Know something; I'd take a pee in the gutter over Julia Roberts any day. (They realize it sounds gross and laugh) He just left, in the middle of our own party, you don't do that. Unless, of course, you're chasing after someone who's already done it, and then I think it's okay. Don't check your email. Once on a dare. The other times were just for fun. I'm not in college anymore. I'd love to go back and be that person again, but you can't move backwards you can only go forward. I want to go into this club and find my fiancé. Wanna bet? (They get up) Follow my lead. (To doorman) Hey, big guy. (Flashes doorman, geeks watching.) I said follow my lead. Oh, my god...I'm going to barf. Where's my purse, where's my purse? (Sleeps) I'm okay."
85,1,5,man on street, Probably famous.
86,1,5,marshall ,"TEN SECONDS!! That was some pretty grownup stuff we did this morning. I like wine. I like tasting. You know I can party, let's do it. Let's rock it, maturity style! Alright, well, have fun at your little disco, guys. Yeah, it's going to be sweet, too. Like tonight we're tasting all these different wines, pairing them up with these cool gourmet cheeses... Ah, no I think we're going to wait on the baby thing. I mean I love babies. Babies rule. Pudgy arms and stuff, but they make you old. Kind of like this anchor weighing you down to one spot...forever. I don't know guys. It's not awkward unless we let it be awkward. You think it was kind of weird that Ted didn't invite me out with him? Is this what you want? (Imitating Chris) Thirty year fixed mortgage. (Imitating Claire) I'm three months pregnant. (You see Claire behind him) That was awkward. (Claire turns around and leaves) Freaking ten ends. You know what they're doing in there right now? They're watching Claire's ultrasound video and I swear to god even the baby looks bored. You're also trying to get me excited about fondue? Okay, that does sound good. But it's dipping stuff in hot cheese with boring people. Taxi! Hey, Robin. Why aren't you inside? Oh, I had this move. So I came here to bust it. Can you get me in? (Motions to doorman that he's with her) Thanks, I'll see ya. Aah! Coat wench do not uncheck that man's jacket. Sorry, just being dramatic. You're not a wench. Lily? Pfft. Who cares right? Oh, I'm so dead. Aah! I put my ass and probably other parts of my body on the line to party with my bro. Now damn it, we're gonna party. Yes, finally I don't have to wait half an hour for a drink.  Yeah. No tannins.  AAAGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!! (Pulls out crown)  I'm staying. (Marshall dances ridiculously, in pain) Broke my tooth.  YOU KNOW DUDE, CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING? IT KIND OF HURT THAT YOU GUYS DIDN'T INVITE ME OUT (Lily's asleep on his shoulder) I MEAN I KNOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE I GOT ENGAGED BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO BE ASKED. I KNOW, I KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SUDDENLY WE'RE LIVING IN TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS. MAYBE YOU'VE GOT MORE IN COMMON WITH BARNEY. IT'S A PLAN! HEY MAYBE IT'LL BE THAT CUTE COAT CHECK GIRL! YOU KNOW, TED, I DON'T SAY THIS NEARLY ENOUGH BUT REALLY..."
87,1,5,narrator ,"So kids, would you like to hear the story of the time I went deaf? I sure am. It all began. When Robin strolled into the bar and said. Why was this funny? I'll explain. You see. Lily was a kindergarten teacher. And so, one fateful naptime... Marshall knew she was right. He had to stop acting like a kid. But not tonight. Now our apartment was on the third floor, so I'm not sure if this part is actually true, but Uncle Marshall swears it happened. I think that's when I realized, clubs weren't awesome. Clubs weren't even ""okay"". Clubs sucked. I had to get out of there. Oh man, I can't believe I forgot to tell you this. This is important to the story. Earlier that day, Marshall went to the dentist and got a temporary crown put in. Okay, so anyway. Again, I wasn't there. So I'm a little foggy on the details. (Lily jumps on the ground of the alleyway) Now to this day, I don't know what happened in there. But when Marshall came out a few minutes later, (Marshall comes out happy and relieved) So, Marshall and Lily rediscovered their youth. It was nice, and then it got icky. (Lily and Marshall kiss and she grabs his ass) It wasn't."
88,1,5,phil ," Oh, come on! He just got here! Holy Crap. We just saw Brian Affleck! (High-five) You shoulda snuck in with Brian Affleck. ""Follow my lead""."
89,1,5,robin ,"Say you're my bitch. Because tonight, I am getting us all into ""Okay"". Yeah, well the owner goes to my gym. It turns out that he is a fan of my reporting for Metro News One. So now, I'm on the list for tonight. He's even getting me into the VIP room. Okay, what does ""VIP"" stand for in your universe? Alright, so you guys are in. Should I invite Marshall and Lily? Got it. Anyway, Ted, part two of my story: my friend Kelly's going to be there. Oh, you are gonna love Kelly. She's fun, she's smart, she lives in the moment. Oh, and she's totally hot. No, Kelly works with the news breakers...  My bitches! Check this out. (To Doorman) They're with me. (Doorman allows them in) Yeah, she's around somewhere. Let's go find her, I'll introduce you guys. Then I should probably dock into the VIP room, so stupid and arbitrary isn't it, who get's to be in VIP and who doesn't? It's... not that arbitrary...  There's Kelly. (Leads them through the crowd) (To VIP room doorman. Subtitle) Robin Scherbastky? (Door man shakes head) Robin Scherbatsky! (Doorman refuses. Robin walks away) Hey! I'm calling the owner, there's a guy in there who won't let me in to the stupid VIP room. What are you doing here? Great, voicemail. Bye.  And it's not that I care so much about getting into the VIP room, I have been in tons of VIP rooms, not exactly a VIP room virgin. (You see doormen changing shifts) Seriously, call me back. (Turns around to doorman #2) Oh, um... I was just in there. Robin Scherbatsky, I'm on the list. But, I'm Robin Scherbatsky. I'm a reporter for channel one. Hey. Actually, I can't even get myself in. I was such a dork. I get recognized one time and I start thinking I'm Julia Roberts. No VIP. I'm not even an IP. I'm just a lonely little P sitting out here in the gutter. Well, I hate to take his side... but come one a wine tasting? What's the big plan for next Saturday, scrabble night? Why are you becoming this person? I heard that in college you flashed a campus tour group on a dare. Um, pause... you can go wherever you want. I guess the question is where do you want to go? Well that you can't do. (Silence)"
90,1,5,son ,Why does he even ask?
91,1,5,ted ,"I'm your bitch. Why this time? What's going on, did I just have a stroke? A friend of yours named you? Nice going, Scherbatsky. You're becoming a long and difficult-to-spell household name. Ever since then she's been signing him up for book clubs, cooking classes... So, no. Lily and Marshall will not be doing this. Kelly, who supposedly I'm gonna love? Okay, I guess I can take her off your hands for an evening. What, what, what...? Thank you. Alright, Tin-Man. Let's hit it. Alright, cool kids are leaving now. Grandma, grandpa... don't wait up. Do strategies ever work for you? This place seems great. Is Kelly here? Can we come? Whoa... this place in lourd!  You want to go somewhere we can talk? ...Okay...  So, how do you know Robin?  Is that near Westchester?  ""14""?  ""7""?  You really like this place? (Kelly nods. Subtitle) You have no idea what I'm saying, do you? I'm from outer space! I got thrown out of Sea World for humping a dolphin! (Music stops. Ted yells) I'M WETTING MY PANTS. (Everyone stares at him. Music begins again)  I'm bailing, see ya.  Nice eyes. Cute smile. Out of your league. What are you doing here? Lily let you go? You are so dead. Wow. Uh... I'm going home. Alright, one beer.  Come on, let's go. (Marshall refuses)  There's Barney. I'm leaving. (Marshall wobbles over to Barney) Yeah, these clubs are supposed to be fun, right? Why do I hate them so much? Or New Year's Eve. Or parades. Or parades. I really hate parades. (Laughs) Right. So, by that logic, if you and I were to, say, go out on a date. Right. The DMV it is. Sounds awful, it's a date. But there's still one big question that needs to be answered. How many of these coats do you think I could put on all at once?  Barney. What? What happened to that, uh, cutlet you were grinding with?  What?!  Alright, I promise. Let's get Marshall and go, okay. (Takes coats off. To Coat Check Girl) Hey. Thanks for saving my night. I'll talk to you soon? Umm, hey... tip her, Barney. Funny story, Barney was grinding with this girl all night... That's a handy new trick. (They run up to the dance floor)  I'M REALLY GLAD YOU GUYS CAME OUT TONIGHT. I'M SORRY, I JUST ASSUMMED YOU... --HAD OTHER PLANS. I MEAN LATELY... YOU CRAZY? YOU THINK I LIKE GOING TO THOSE CLUBS? I'D SO MUCH RATHER GO TO YOUR FRUITY LITTLE WINE TASTING. PROBLEM IS... YOU CAN'T DO ANY OF THAT COUPLE STUFF UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO DO IT WITH. AND THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO FIND THAT SOMEONE IS BY GOING OUT DOING STUPID SINGLE STUFF WITH BARNEY. BUT MAN, WHEN I FIND HER. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME BADASS WINE TASTINGS. YEAH, MAYBE IT WILL BE."
92,1,5,woman , Hi. Barney?? (Pushes him away and storms off. Barney walks out to the coat check)
93,1,5,,"Barney:... I know that the ""P"" is pen1s. Chris:...And with todays interest rate climbing, you gotta go for the thirty year fixed mortgage. Doorman#2: Name's already crossed off, sorry. Doorman#2: There's a channel one? Back of the line! Marshall:...Do you have... Marshall:...any aspirin? Barney, Ted and Robin: (Subtitle) Eww."
94,1,6,angel guy," Whoa, I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's people walking down there.  Yeah, whatever. You guys got some weed?"
95,1,6,barney ,"You know what I love about Halloween? It's the one night of the year chicks use to unleash their inner ho-bag. If a girl dresses up as she a witch, she's a slutty witch. If she's a cat, she's a slutty cat. If she's a nurse... She's a slutty nurse. And she called it the Tootsie Roll. You know, Ted, it's been four years. She could be engaged or married or, God forbid, fat. No, no, not again. Not this year. You're going as my wingman. Flight suit up! Oh you're dangerous, Maverick. Your ego's writing check your body can't cash. OK. Here's the plan, and I crap you not. I'm getting us into the Victoria's Secret Halloween party. Trust me, by the end of the night, your chad will not be hanging. Hm, (putting up left hand) Victoria's Secret models prancing around in bras and panties, or (putting up right hand) Yale preppies reuniting their stupid a capella group. What's that left hand? Right hand sucks? Word. Well, boys, looks like it's just the three of us. What's that? Self-five? Nice. (high fives himself) We out. I can't believe you talked me into this. This party sucks. There are seven chicks here. There are six chicks here. What be a pirate's favorite kind of sweater? And what be a pirate's favorite fast food restaurant? Would think it would be Arby's, (talking normal) but actually it's Long John Silver's. Hey. So, what does a fella have to do to get lei'd around here? Yeah. It isn't funny if you explain the joke. Let's bail. Name one person you know at this party. OK, I'm leaving, but just know that this Victoria's Secret party is on a yacht. And what will be sticking to that yacht? The Barnacle. (points to self) Yeah, the Barnacle. That's it. Barnacle out. (Barney walks away) That's right. Every Halloween, I bring a spare costume in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party. That way I have a second chance to make a first impression. What's with the face? So go to the bathroom. So pee off the roof. Ooh, Ted, pee off the roof. Come on, Ted, who are you going to listen to? Me or Mr. Goody-goody over there. Let me guess. Every guy has used the lei'd line on you tonight. I apologize for my gender. Let me make it up to you. Make you a drink. I'm also a horny devil. (pointing to horns on top of head) Yeah. Oh, go to hell. OK Victoria's Secret party right now. Come on, I can't stand to watching my delusional friend waste another precious Halloween. The Slutty Pumpkin is not coming. Oy. Wow. I did not understand a word you just said. Lingerie models on a boat! No, see ya. (evil laughs, sparks something in his hands) Ow. You are such a loser. Come on, I came back for you, Ted. I penguin-suited up to show you the error of your ways. And to score hula girl's number. Check and check. Yes, it is. What? No no, that's some other guy and he was a kick-ass fighter pilot Yeah, well, you did, thanks. Uh, I don't think so. I earned it fair and square. I'm calling you. But how will you know it's me? I'm a master of disguise. Yeah. Come on, Ted, Victoria's Secret party now. Let's go. Fine. Fine. (puts his flipper up towards Ted) I'm flippering you off."
96,1,6,carl ,"Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in. And the winners of this year's costume contest are Lily Aldrin as a parrot and Marshall Eriksen as a gay pirate. Dude, you're wearing eye liner."
97,1,6,future ted," You know how Aunt Robin's a big fan of Halloween, always dressing up in crazy costumes? Well, she wasn't always that way. Back in 2005, she thought she was too cool for Halloween, unlike Aunt Lily."
98,1,6,future ted vo," And then just when I was about to lose hope.  Kahlua, root beer, could this penguin be the Slutty Pumpkin?"
99,1,6,hula girl," Hey.  Right, cuz I'm wearing a lei.  You wouldn't believe.  You certainly are a charming devil.  No.  Wait a minute. You're that lame army guy.  I cannot believe I gave you my number  Well, give it back.  But I'm never gonna go out with you."
100,1,6,king costume guy," Ladies and gentlemen, as on-pitch as they were at Spring Fling '95, it's my pleasure to welcome back the Shagarats."
101,1,6,lily ,"Guess what came in the mail today? They rule. And yours is 100% wool so you won't get hypothermia like last year. Wow, we get it. Mike? There's a Mike? You have a boyfriend? You haven't told us? How about we go about a Halloween double-date? Come on, Robin, trot our your new fella. Let us judge and evaluate him behind your back. It'll be fun. Every Halloween Ted waits for the Slutty Pumpkin. Kahlua and root beer Happy Halloween. Cher? I don't know, but we have plenty of chocolate here. Uh-oh. Oh, on the off chance that that could happen, maybe we should stop calling her the Slutty Pumpkin. Ted, is your world ready to be rocked? (echo) rocked-rocked-rocked.  So, what do you think? (squawks) We are so gonna win the costume contest this year.  Each. What are you going as? Oh, like I even have to ask. Yeah, four years ago, but nobody remembers what the hell a hanging chad is. Sad commentary. (squawks) All right, Polly gotta pee. I'm a parrot. Where's Mike? Yes, it's weirdly hot. So, where's your costume? Arr-gyle. Arrr-by's It's so nice to meet you, Mike. You guys are really cute together. I think you won the dish-off tonight, baby. This steak totally bitch-slapped my pork chop. Oh for God's sake. (Lily grabs Mike's hand and eats food from his fork) Really tasty. Do you like Mike? It just doesn't seem like it. You won't share your food. You won't wear a costume. OK, I know that stuff looks dumb from the outside, but it's kinda the greatest thing in the world when you're a part of it. If you just give it a chance, you might like it. Robin, Mike likes you. If you don't start meeting him halfway, you're gonna lose him. Look, it's Halloween. Just put on the girlfriend costume for the night. How about you start by sharing dessert. Take the damn picture. (squawks) Thanks, Marshmallow. Sweetie, I'm so sorry. Oh, who cares, Marshall? We won! I love you, Marshmallow."
102,1,6,marshall ,"Our costumes? Do they rule? Tarzan nipple blue. Robin, what are you doing for Halloween? So why haven't we met him? Hey, Ted, you'll never guess what happened? Our costumes...yes, that is why we're best friends. A cocktail she invented herself. Right here, babe. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. What's her take on Ewoks? Oh good. I don't know why people are so cynical about Ewoks. The Rebellion would have failed without the Ewoks. Oh, penguins are cool, kinda like black and white Ewoks. I approve. So, what do you think? Oh, yeah. Weirdly hot, right? First prize, $50 gift certificate at the bar. $100 What a sad commentary on our national attention span that we could forget such a turbulent time in our political history. Again? It's an elaborate costume. Seriously, does my eye liner look OK? I think we got them beat. Starrr-ving That might be true but your rice pilaf kicked my spinach in the crotch so hard it threw up a little bit. This is gonna be a slaughter. None of these other costumes even come close to ours. I still think we should have won as Sonny and Cher. Maybe if I had worn that red dress. Ha! If I could turn back time. Apple tart, excellent choice, Lilypad. So this Italian place? How's their cannoli? Oh yeah! Wait. What did he say? Gay pirate, where are you getting that from? OK, I just want everybody here to know that I'm not a gay pirate. I have s*x with my parrot all the time. That came out wrong. Oh yeah, it doesn't matter! We won! I love you too, Lilypad."
103,1,6,mike ,"Hi. Where's your costume, Gretel? Oh. Yeah, we've been spending a lot of time together. We're even getting to that point where we finish each other's (stops talking, waiting for Robin to finish sentence) Good. See.  Robin, you have to try this chicken. Really tasty. Come on, just try a little bite. You know, if you guys like tiramisu we found this little Italian place... I'm just saying we love tiramisu. We're crazy for this stuff. We love tiramisu. Am I wrong in saying that.? Yeah, looks like we're both hungry. Wait, where? I don't see... You know what, it's getting late. I think I'm gonna take off. Robin, I don't get the sense you like being with me. Not as much as you like being alone. You like eating your own food, sleeping in your own bed, doing your own crosswords. Actually, it kinda does. We aren't breaking up. I'm breaking up with you."
104,1,6,robin ,"Oh, I don't know. Probably hanging out with Mike, this guy I've been seeing. No, I mean, he's not my boyfriend. He's just this guy I've been seeing for a couple of weeks. We're not really ready to go public yet. I don't know, we were kinda thinking about staying at home and dressing up as naked people. Hey, Ted, what are you doing for Halloween? What? What's the Slutty Pumpkin? Wait, how can a pumpkin costume be sexy? Hey, Chad, how's it hanging?  Whoo.  Nice outfit. You sure are. He's meeting me here. I ran late covering the Halloween parade in the Village. There are like a zillion gay pirates this year. Uh, you know, Mike and I joked about doing something together but we decided not to dress up. Oh, geez. Ah, everyone, this is Michael. Th-that is not his real hair. You thought I was...Oh, I was just kidding. I gotta stop making jokes in e-mails. It's so hard to convey tone. Actually I kinda need this hand to eat. This cheeseburger is so... Oh, well, that's good. I'm OK, thanks. I'm just really feeling this cheeseburger. Dude, I'm kind of in the zone here. So, do you like Mike? Of course I do. Why? Ah, Lily, you know me, I'm just not into all that couple-y stuff. Are you trying to get me to join a cult? What? OK, what am I supposed to do? Buy him a giant teddy bear or something? I can share dessert. He better want the brownie sundae, but yeah, yeah, I can totally share. A little to the left, Marshall. Lily, squat down. Got it. Wow, this sundae looks so good I could eat the whole thing. But, um, I would much rather share this small, one-scoop sundae with you, Mike. Well, let's dig in, Mi... Mi... Microwave Oven. No, you found it. I came with you. Go on. I cannot get enough of it. I'm crazy and you're crazy for tiramisu. No, no, no, I mean it just sounds a little bit weird, doesn't it? We love tiramisu. Is it really a group activity, loving tiramisu? Right? See there, hungry. Hey, is that Gary Oldman? (pointing behind Mike and Marshall) Brain freeze. Wanna drink the melty part? Hey, I thought we were gonna follow those bread crumbs back to my place, Hansel I like being with you. Well, who uses ink? Sorry. OK, I'm a bit set in my ways. That doesn't mean that this won't work. Wait, are we breaking up? Seriously it's not a big deal. He wanted to be a 'we,' and I wanted to be an 'I'. Dudes are such chicks. You guys, I'm fine. You guys, let me get a picture. I had a feeling I'd find you here. I never played any team sports I played tennis in high school. You know why? Because it was just me out there. I couldn't even stand playing doubles. I just got dumped. Yeah, it's OK. I wasn't that into him. Story of my life. Everyone else is all falling in love and acting stupid and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me. Why don't I want that more? I want to want that. Am I wired wrong or something? Well, what if I'm just a cold person? Tonight, Mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but I couldn't be Gretel. Why can't I be Gretel? Really? How do you do this, Ted? How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up. Scoot."
105,1,6,shagarats , My bonnie lies over the ocean. My bonnie lies over the sea. My bonnie lives over the ocean. Oh bring back my bonnie to me...
106,1,6,ted ,"Your costumes came. Well. That's right. You mean, who is the Slutty Pumpkin? It was four years ago. I was at this Halloween party up on the roof of our building. I'm about to call it an early night when out of nowhere appeared this girl in the sexiest pumpkin costume. It was carved in strategic places. So, uh, we're at the bar and I see her mix kahlua... And she... Hey, can I please tell this story? So we had this instant connection. She gave me her number, but then something... Guys! Something went terribly wrong. Sonny, where's Cher? I just met the perfect woman. She's funny. She's beautiful. She loves Star Wars. Loves them. Get this, she's a marine biologist. She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins. Hey, where's my, uh, Kit Kat? I put it right here on this table. No no no, you don't understand. I need that Kit Kat. She wrote her number on that wrapper. Where is it? Hey, Dracula. Come on. Give me your candy. Gimme! Where's the Kit Kat? Where's the Kit Kat! Never found her number, never saw her again. But every year they have a Halloween party up on the roof so that's where I'll be. I don't know, I got a feeling. This could be the year. Halloween is a night of wonder and magic. OK, bring the mockery. Fine, I can take it. Come on, wouldn't it be the coolest story ever if the Slutty Pumpkin turned out to be my future wife? Can't wait. Wow! Marshall, you wearing eye liner? And how much did you pay for your costumes? Well, I think you guys look great. Hey, I want the Slutty Pumpkin to recognize me and she knows me as a hanging chad. What? She thought it was hilarious. Where are you going? No thanks. I'm sticking with the hanging chad. We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year. Tonight, I'm going up to the roof, I'm gonna have a few beers, I'm gonna wait for the Slutty Pumpkin. That's just what I do. I'm heading up to the roof. Hey, word play. Funny. I didn't. You followed me up here. Relax, the night is young. It's gonna get better. Oh, Barney, come on, I'm having fun. It's really great seeing these guys again. Well, there's ninja, back of horse. Where's front of horse? That guys a riot. Where is he? Really? That's the nickname now? The Barnacle. Have fun, Barnacle. Barney. What, you're back? In a totally new costume. It's half you're pathetic, half I have to pee. No, there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the Slutty Pumpkin. Nope. She might. Come on, Barney, this is not about the odds, this is about believing. This girl, she represents something to me, I don't know, hope.  See ya. She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins. Uh, excuse me, this is gonna sound crazy, but I met someone up on this roof four years ago and they mixed that cocktail and they loved penguins. By any chance, was that you? It's you. I was crazy but I can't... Unbelievable. Nice. I'm staying. What are you doing? Hey. If you're here for the Shagarats, you just missed the fourth encore. Are we playing 'I never' cuz there's nothing left but peach schnapps. Man, that sucks. No. Look, you didn't want to be with me so clearly you have abysmal taste in men. But you're wired just fine. Because you just haven't met the right Hansel yet. One day you're gonna meet a guy who's gonna make you want to look like a complete idiot. Yeah, he's out there somewhere, just like the Slutty Pumpkin. (echoes) pumpkin-pumpkin... Well, I'm pretty drunk. Look, I know that odds are the love of my life isn't going to magically walk through that door in a pumpkin costume at 2:43 in the morning but it seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know, sit and wait."
107,1,6,,"Lily (in a sing-song voice): Boyfriend. Barney (in a sing-song voice): Married. Marshall, Lily, Barney: Awww. Lily, Marshall, Barney: Because it tastes like an alcoholic Tootsie Roll. Marshall, Lily, Barney: Something went terribly wrong. Lily, Robin: Oh yeah. Oh, thank you"
108,1,7,barney ,"What the? Haha, joke's on you, I have a cold. Marshall ran away from a cockroach. Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man. Was that chick at the end really a client? We're signing up. Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot. That's a perfect cocktail. Shake well, then sleep with. Come on. Ted, hurry, you gotta help me. My boat is sinking. My boat is sinking. Come on, Ted, this is an incredible opportunity. We'll meet our soulmates, nail 'em and never call them again. (chuckles) Gosh, thanks, Ellen. I sure hope this works. I'm so done with the single life, all the games, the meaningless s*x. That is so true, Ellen. I really think I'm ready to stop being a me and start being a we. It's kinda hard to talk about with Ted here, but I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night when the tears come. Ellen, can you help me find her? What? Oh my God, people do that. What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out? OK, Ted, let's go. It's pronounced 'Pa-kojj.' Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that. So did you get a good look at it? Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha? Oh, yeah, we do that behind your back. Ted-out: to overthink. Also see Ted-up. Ted-up: to overthink something with disastrous results. Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman. You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny. Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game. The doctor will see you now.  Happy ending. All right, see you later. Happy hunting. Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles."
109,1,7,daughter ,"Wow, that was a great story, Dad."
110,1,7,ellen ,"Science. Everything in life can be broken down to ones and zeros, even love. All finished, gentlemen? Congratulations, you have just taken your very first step. You deserve more. Oh, of course you can. That is so... Get out. I get 15 guys like you every week. Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call them again. You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way? That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself. Not you, you stay. You're cute. You're an architect. Good career and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application like your friend, Jack Package. Get outta here! You I can work with. You give me three days and I will find the woman you will marry. Plenty of fish in the sea. Yes, there's 9 million people in New York, 4.5 million women. Of course you wanna meet someone roughly your own age, let's say, plus minus 5 years. So if we take into account the most recent census data, that leaves us with 482,000. But, uh, wait There are 8 fish in that big, blue ocean, Ted. And if you feel confident that you can reel one into your boat without me, there's the door. Ted, hi. I meant to call you. The computer is still crunching the numbers. Busy as a bee, that little computer. Did I? Three days? Really? How do I say this? This is gonna be really hard. Ted, there are absolutely no women out there for you. Phew, actually I got through that OK. I know. There are supposed to be. I don't know where they are. How do you think I feel? I have a 100% success rate. It's my hook. I could probably find somebody for you if you were gay. A little bi maybe? Come see for yourself. I cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 or higher, and look, 5.4, 4.8, 5.6... Don't touch the computer. Yes, Sarah O'Brien. I fixed her up six months ago. She would have been absolutely perfect for you. 8.5. No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient. Yes, 9.6 is off the charts, but Sarah is matched up. Ted, look, I have a lunch. Please. I promise we will find you somebody. Don't lose hope. There are new women turning 18 every day. I'm a failure. I'm all washed up. I tried everything, Ted. I widened the search parameters. I tweaked the program. Last night, I stood out on the street for five hours showing your photo to random pedestrians, no takers. Although this tr*nsv*stite hooker said he/she would do you for half price because you kinda look like John Cusack and his/her favorite movie was Say Anything. It's for the bourbon. No, I won't. You're gonna die alone. No, you're never gonna find anybody. And every year, you're just getting older and it's getting harder and harder. No you won't. How do you know? Ted: I don't know, but I believe. Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse can find love in this crazy city, then, dammit, so can I. You're losing me. So I should keep looking?"
111,1,7,future ted," Kids, before I met your mother, when I was still out there searching, I learned something valuable, that love is not a science.  You see, sometimes in life, you just have to accept that certain things can't be explained. And that's kinda scary."
112,1,7,future ted vo," That's right, I did the math."
113,1,7,lily ,"I know, I'm still shaking. Something bad. Oh, mucho sexy. You quiero Marshall. Oh my God. Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse. That was a huge cockroach. But those things coming out of his head, those were antennae It was a cockroach. Oh my God. OK, it's back and this time we got a good look. We were just upstairs watching TV. OK, let's do this. Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton like a roach... It's a cockamouse. It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know... Oh, but it can. And it's pissed. Oh, just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it. He's a whole new species. The cockamouse. Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery. OK, we get it. You're skeptical. But Marshall and I, we're believers. We believe. Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman. Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday. Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse. Holy crap. We got it! What do we do with it? Wait, no no. They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean. Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat? Robin. Oh, is it? Do something. What the hell was that? You trying to get it drunk?"
114,1,7,marshall ,"Oh my God. We saw something, up in the apartment. I don't know what it is, but margaritas make me sexy. Only the craziest, meanest looking mouse you've ever seen. Baby, it was a mouse. It had a whiskers. It, it was a mouse. No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur and only mammals have fur. Come on, Lily, the only way that that was a cockroach was if it was wearing the skin of a mouse it just k*lled. It's bigger now. It's been feeding. Ah gosh. Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over. But it has mouse-like characteristics. Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail. And it has There was no time. And it's the size of a potato. Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cockamouse. And like the majestic seahorse it's hermaphroditic. For as much as we know about the cockamousse, there are still so much we don't know. So you really don't believe in the cockamouse? If by 'like the Loch Ness Monster,' you mean, totally exists and is awesome, then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster. It's diet is not unlike our own, grains, cereals and it's awfully fond of cheese... Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome. You got the Bermuda triangle, ghosts, Big Foot. Aliens. Oh, come one, you gotta give me aliens. Stonehenge. Area 51. There's alien crap all over the place. My friend, you just poked the bear. On the night of July 2nd, 1947, conditions were clear over Roswell, New Mexico. Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you. Dr. O'Brien. When suddenly, an array of Oh my God! Calm down, I have a plan. I told my friend, Sudeep, about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department. But it has to be alive. Brace yourself, dude. This is gonna blow your mind hold. What? Wait, but if it's not here, that means...Lily. Lily thank God. Lily, I love you. Robin, open the window! Be free, mutant beast. I'll miss this private war of ours. I grew to admire your tenacious...Oh my God, it's headed this way."
115,1,7,robin ,"Are you guys OK? Marshall (yelling over to bartender): Another round and back it up for me and Lily. Ooh, my story's on. Ted, pay attention. Carl, turn it up. I'm here with Ellen Pierce, New York's premiere matchmaker. Ellen, your company, Love Solutions boasts a 100% success rate. What's your secret? Love Solution's Ellen Pierce, a beacon of hope for New York city's lovelorn. Robin Scherbatsky... Yes. So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse? What? That's impossible. That simply can't happen. So Love Solutions, did you meet the love of your life? So, what, now it's a cockapotatomouse? Well, we know that there's no such thing as a cockamouse. What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking. Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know, um, like the Loch Ness Monster. Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap. You think the road runner's gonna fall for it? Bad maps. Creaky houses. Hillbilly in a gorilla suit. You can't be serious. Oh. Oh geez. What? Oh my God. It's real. It was the only think I could think of. It can fly."
116,1,7,sarah ,"Hi, I'm Dr. O'Brien. So, what are we doing today? I'm exactly the same. Blowing through the jasmine in my mind. I love brunch. I like the way you think, Architect Mosby. Oh, that's very sweet, but I'm actually getting married on Saturday. Thank you. Only a little. OK, but it's not likely. I look damn good in my dress. Ted, hi, this is Dr. O'Brien. About today, listen, I really need to talk to you. Call me, I'll be at the office all day. I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person. You have a basal cell carcinoma. Your mole. The biopsy came back. It's not life-threatening, but we should excise the rest of it. Of course I'm still getting married. Excuse me. You looked at my file. I am getting married on Saturday. Ted. Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you to proposition an engaged woman you don't even know? Ted, just calm down. Ted, Ted, do you honestly believe deep down that there is no one else out there for you just because some computer says so. Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling. When you fall in love with someone, 8.5 equals a perfect 10."
117,1,7,son ,We're gonna go watch TV.
118,1,7,sudeep ,"If this thing is what you say it is, it could be huge for my career. You b*st*rd, I actually got excited about this. It's empty."
119,1,7,ted ,"What happened? What was it? What? I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up. It's the man version of getting a cat. What? You have a boat? Your boat is sinking. That was good. Ah, no thanks. I don't need an algorithm to meet women. It's New York City. You know, plenty of fish in the sea. That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight? Do you take credit cards? Dude, is everything OK? You left the front door open. She said it'd take three days. It's been five days. Should I be worried? Did you just use my name as a verb? OK, I get it. Don't worry, I'm not gonna ted anything up or out. I'll just give it a few more days. Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted. You said it was gonna be three days. Hm. Yeah. When someone says you're gonna meet the perfect woman in three days, you gotta put that in your datebook, so... There are no women for me out there? I thought you said there were 8. But, I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute. I'm a cute architect. Well, I'm not. No. You're messing with me, right? There's a 9.6 right there. What about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating? So he sucks. Oh, sure, it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6? My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch. OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin. All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that? Hi. I'm Architect Mosby. Sorry I just wanted to say my job too. Hi, I'm Ted. I have a kind of mole on my back. It's probably nothing but I'm a cautious guy. Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind. Sorry about that, Summer Breeze is my guilty pleasure song. Oh, it's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend at brunch. It's the best, as long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies. Hey, this may sound weird but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off so I'm gonna ask you now. Do you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night? Friday night? Wow, you're getting married. Congratulations. I'm really sorry I asked you out. If just felt like there might be this weird connection between us. How crazy am I coming off here? Well, by some million to one shot, and I'm not rooting for this, you wind up not getting married this weekend, give me a call. I'm sure you do. So, my 9.6, beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged. Yeah, it was a long shot. I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mine, but I don't know... What? What should I do? I should totally go down there, right? Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so. Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a shot. Hello again. Go ahead, Sarah, you can tell me anything. Anything else? Wait, then you're still getting married. But we're a 9.6. OK, I, I went to Love Solutions and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer that you and I are a 9.6. Your fiance's only an 8.5. I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious? The woman who set you up with your fiancé thinks we're a better match. Summer breeze... Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met a few months ago? See, we're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other. Calm down! You're my only match! There was a computer and there were 8 fish in the sea full of lesbians. Didn't used to. There was math, I got confused. You're right. Hi Ellen. I think I want my money back. Come on, Ellen, I mean, a pint of ice cream isn't that a bit cliché? This isn't hopeless. You're gonna find someone for me. I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive. You just have to get back out there and keep looking. You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be up on that wall one of these days. Yes I will Point is, something good is going to happen to me. Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen. Of course you should. And now you're gonna do it for free."
120,1,7,,"Lily, Marshall: Wow."
121,1,8,barney ,"No, it's like it'll change everything. Oh, Ted, you are so screwed. Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be? You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out. Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment. Sort of on a date with her. I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile. (evil laugh) But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital. Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck. Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy. Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up? An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy. Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter? Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there. See you guys later. Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one. Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike. You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big. Bigger. Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law. Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now. Hi Katie. Barney. Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history. Tell your friends. It's gonna be a thing. No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing! No, wrong, lemon law is awesome. OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy. You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two? Bad move, Scherbatsky. Hi, have you met Robin?  Time's running out, Scherbatsky. Last chance for the lemon law. 4:56, 4:57, 4:58. Say I'm right and this could all be over. This could be your call from the hospital. So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie. What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie. Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O. It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law. And to the lemon law. Self-clink."
122,1,8,daughter ,"Wait, her apartment? I thought Aunt Lily lived with you and Uncle Marshall."
123,1,8,delivery guy, Delivery for Ted Mosby.
124,1,8,doctor ,All set. She said she'd like to see the knights of the poorly constructed round table?
125,1,8,everyone ,Here here. Cheers
126,1,8,future ted," So kids, there are many buildings New York City.  Thousands of apartments. Millions of stories. And even though it's been decades and someone else lives there now, there's one apartment in particular that will always be our apartment. I have so many great memories of that place."
127,1,8,future ted vo," Marshall playing video games.  Lily painting on the fire escape.  And me making the coffee. I had this coffeepot that was probably 50 years old at that time, and it made truly terrible coffee. We called it Shocky  I loved every last detail of that place. Right down to the incredibly tacky swords we hung on the wall. I never wanted any of it to change. But that's not how life works."
128,1,8,jackie ,"Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to lemon law you."
129,1,8,katie ,"Hi, it's good to finally meet you."
130,1,8,kevin ,"Hi. I can't believe this. I'm sitting here with a beautiful woman I just met eating at my favorite restaurant. Sweet. In the future food will most likely be served in gel-cap form. Plus cows will probably have died out by then... or be our leaders. Let me guess, there's been a crazy accident and you have to go. Look, if you're a hooker, I don't have a lot of money. Hab slosi quch! You have no honor. You know, if you felt this way you could have just been upfront."
131,1,8,lily ,"Sorry, Mr. Madsen. You guys will never believe what just happened to us. We were in Queens and we decided to stop by my apartment. I could see how you would think that but I have to have my own place. It's an independence thing. Three months ago. What? It's like fat pants. You hope you never have to use 'em but you're glad to know they're there. What the hell? This is my apartment. Right here. What the hell? No, no, this was my apartment. My dresser was right... That's my dresser! And this is my closet. Yes, you know me? Yeah, I know, the bangs were a mistake. Where's my stuff? Waitress: It's all in the back. We could wrap it up for you. You want it to go? This is my apartment! When? OK so I didn't have a written lease as such but, but go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy. She may be 98 years old but she's still... She's dead, isn't she? My apartment is a Chinese restaurant. What am I gonna do? Really? Done. The painting's done. I don't know. Um, over the piano? OK. Man, Ted's been acting weird. He started labeling all his food. He even carved ""Ted"" into that block of cheese. He's not cool with me moving in. So, what's he PMS'ing about? Are you kidding? You guys never talk about anything. He'll just let it fester under the surface until he does something big and passive-aggressive. A sword fight? On Monday, I'm gonna have to tell my kindergarten class who I teach not to run with scissors that my fiancé ran me through with a frickin' broad sword. I'm sorry, is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me? Wait wait wait wait wait. I don't want that apartment. It's a boy apartment. It's full of swords and videogames, and kinda smells like dude. It's fine for now, but when we get married, I wanna start a new life with you in a new place. I will too. We're not getting married for like a year. Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking but I'm starving. I know just the place. I told you. OK, a toast. Life is full of changes. One day you have an apartment, the next day it's a house of dumplings. But the important stuff doesn't change. To the important stuff. And by the way, I bought these glasses. I bought them at Ikea. These are my glasses. I'm pretty sure this is a mixed tape you made me in sophomore year."
132,1,8,marshall ,"Saving game. Yeah, the building would have had to give you some sort of notice. Well, still, legally, they can't just toss you out onto the street. You have a lease. You sure about this, Ted? So, when Lily and I get married, who's gonna get the apartment? Who? Totally. Let's let those guys handle it. Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kinda rusty. Also Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock you. You know what else wakes you up in the morning? Coffee. That is great. Where do you wanna hang it? Well, those swords have been up there a long time. Yeah. Well, now it's Ed's. No, that's not it. I mean, you basically lived here all along. Ted loves you. I don't know. But when he's ready to talk to me about it he'll come and talk to me about it. You clearly don't know Ted. Your English phone booth arrived. Yeah, I guess. Just not sure if Lily's gonna like it. Of course, we all live here so we should all be able to have things the way we want them. Great Terrific. You like the phone booth. It stays. I like this painting so I'm just gonna hang it...right here on the wall. Bring, bring. Oh hello governor, oh it's like isn't it? Cheerio. Yeah, it's like that. Well, I want it too. Or we could flip a coin. Flip it. Flip it. Flip it. That was five years ago. Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter. Oh snap. What else you got? You don't need two rooms We might be starting a family soon. It could be sooner, we're not that careful with our birth control Two-zip. Oh, and I suppose you'll get a new roommate? Who's it gonna be? Barney? You know he cooks naked. My fiancé...suddenly, she's my fiancé. No more than I do. Flip it. I guess so. We should probably figure that out. That this is kinda awesome? I can't believe we didn't do this before. That was awesome. Do it again. Oh, boo-freakin-hoo. Woe is me. I'm not married yet. My ovaries are shrinking. Ted, if you wanted to be married by now you would be but you're not. And you know why? Because you're irrationally picky. You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic. Anhedonic. It means you can't enjoy anything. I know, this rules. Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down. Yeah it did. You remember when we first got these swords? List of lifelong dreams, you're not half as long. Crap. I'm missing one of the screws for this table Yeah. I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fiancé. They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine. That's us. Well, just to be fair, it didn't go all the way through. You're right. I'm sorry. We were fighting to see who gets the apartment. And I won. Uh, you know, if I tried... Gonna miss the old place. Totally. Let's go get some dinner. I love this song. I haven't heard this in forever. I love you, Lily. Happy Valentine's Day 1998."
133,1,8,robin ,"I don't even believe it myself. When was the last time you were there? What? Where? Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant. And why is that girl checking you out? Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right? Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal? You're going to the hospital? Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney. So, are you gonna talk to Marshall? Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it. Ooh, can I do it? Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff. Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate. Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she! Ted, why don't you just talk to him? He's your best friend. One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication. A lemon law, like for cars. For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society. It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great. Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate. Hi. Thank you. It's a nice place. It's good to know the future has ribs. Just a second. Hello. Leave me alone. We're only just getting to know each other. Sorry. No, I would never do that. I don't wanna go anywhere. I'm all yours. Oh God, I'll be right there. Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go. My friend's been stabbed with a sword. No, I swear that was a real call. I just...Oh forget it. Is she OK? But you're totally... Lily, your apartment makes the best Shanghai dumplings."
134,1,8,ted ,"Plugging in. No way. You're making this up. Come live with us. Of course. Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything. What? What are you talking about? Yeah, so? Yeah, we've talked about it. Oh, that's a tough one. You know who I think could handle a problem like that? Future Ted and Future Marshall. Dammit Past Ted That's crazy. They're not edging me out. Marshall's my best friend. One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me. What? All right. No, see, he's gonna go back over there and I'm gonna call him and he's gonna pretend that it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital. He's gonna want the apartment. I'm gonna want the apartment. It's gonna lead to an argument, so no. I should really make this call. Ah, this'll be nice, the three of us living together. I think it's a good setup. Man, this coffee's great. It's really great. Too great. What happened to Shocky? What's this? Lily: My coffeemaker from my apartment. Makes great coffee, right? Yeah, definitely. I mean, so does Shocky. Yeah, no, it did. I mean, I kinda liked the rusty taste. I'm used to it. I don't know. No. You gotta admit, that shock, wakes you up in the morning That's great. You're right. Roomies! I love it. They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right. It's not just the coffeemaker. Nice. Yeah, that would be a good place for it. Too bad the swords are there. We kinda love those swords. I know, right? I'd really miss them too. So, maybe Marshall's room? He was gonna take the swords down. Can you believe that? Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do? What, like buy a new sofa? Oh, awesome. It's great, right? Well, I like it, so I'm just gonna keep it right here, if that's cool. Exactly. Oh, so it's like that, is it? I want this apartment. All right Marshall, we're deciding right now who gets this apartment. It may lead to an argument, but we're settling this. Yeah, let's flip a coin. OK, I'm flipping it, here I go. OK, here I go. I'm flipping. But before I do, I just wanna say something. You didn't even wanna move in here in the first place. You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies. OK, I'm flipping. Heads or tails. Heads or tails, Marshall. Like you need two rooms? Oh, no you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're in law school. It's gonna be at least three years. Oh, come on, you know damn well I move out that room's going unused. Yeah, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the swords down. We were bros! These swords represent our bro-hood. And you took 'em down to make room for your fiance's stupid painting? I deserve this apartment, Marshall. Great, so let's flip for it. So, is this how we're deciding who gets the apartment? How are we doing this exactly? Is this like to the death? It's OK, it's OK. Can I observe something? Totally. I know! I know. OK, but this time, jump up and I'll swipe your legs. Look. Here's why I should get the place. You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates. And on top of that I could be homeless. Does that seem fair? What? Anhedonic? The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this. That's OK, it led to this totally rad sword fight, didn't it? It was the day we moved in. Congratulations, Marshall. We live in an apartment with swords on the wall. Just use this wood glue, it'll hold. Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fiancé? I'm kidding. Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment. Marshall: But you fought so bravely for it. I wasn't fighting for the apartment. I was fighting for...I don't know...for everything to stay the way it is. But I'm not gonna get that, so, seriously, take the place, it's yours. Just let him have this one. Uh, you didn't win. I gave it to you. Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem. Let that guy deal with it. Chinese restaurant, I still don't believe it."
135,1,8,waitress ,"Hi, how many? Yeah, from your homecoming picture. You're much prettier in person. Not anymore. They sent you a notice about this. Three months ago. Here's your mail minus the magazines. Never even saw the bus."
136,1,8,,"Mr. Madsen: Hey!  Waitress: Lily. Girl #2: You're a jerk.  Marshall: Lily's a part of who I am. And if you're such a bro, she's a part of who you are too. She's a bro by extension. Marshall, Ted: Sorry, Lily."
137,1,9,amanda ,"I'm Amanda. So, what do you do here, Ted? If you want to do something, you and your girlfriend can help sort through these donations. OK, this is important. Go through all these boxes of food donations, take out the really good stuff and put it into this box. Oh, that's for me. You can put it in my car. Home? We get so much extra food, no one can eat it all. Oh, Truffle oil. Score. I know, and I'm starving. Those are good mushrooms!"

Heather dresses up as a pilgrim and Misty dresses up as an Indian, and they share a meal. I'm sorry, Native American. Canceling out Barney. Excuse me, guys. Coming through. Well, hi guys. Oh, just the Lord's work. Guys, OK, look, I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here. I think it's important to help the less fortunate. I'm the Angelina Jolie of incredibly hot guys. I'm on it. That's because I was trained by the best, Kendall. Kendall, they're cool. OK, well, I better get out there. There's a lot of food to give out. And a lot of smiles. Man, it's amazing out there. I've done so much good today, I've got like a soul boner.  You wanna scoop stuffing your first day out? Hello, NFL, can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude. So, wait, not only have you not done any good for anyone today, you're actually helping someone steal from the homeless. You know, Ted, it's called Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking. Damn. Yeah, Right. Thanks. Yeah, what's up? Yeah, so. That's my private personal business! That's my private personal business. I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church. I peed in an alley which happened to have a church which I did not see because I was drunk. OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW. When's the last time either of you did any good? Huh? I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip. Volunteer of the year! Ted, I'm glad you asked. Right? I told you so. OK, Ted, I found a way for you to help someone, to do some good. This is Walter, and Walter is homeless. And Walter would like a lap dance. I never joke about the sublime art of burlesque entertainment. Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners. You know where he hasn't been? To heaven with Samantha. Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need. Now buy this man a lap dance."

142,1,9,future ted," Kids, this is a Thanksgiving story.  I'm kidding."
143,1,9,future ted vo," Thanksgiving in New York is a wonderful time. It's a time for giving of yourself, for thinking of your fellow man, a time when the unforgiving city becomes a little kinder.  And go they went, all the way to St. Cloud, Minnesota, Marshall's hometown. And as Lily stepped into her fiance's boyhood home, she received a big welcome.  A very big welcome. You see, at 6'4"", Marshall was the runt of the Ericksen clan.  Actually Aunt Lily was lying. It'd been all she'd been thinking about. You see, remember when she said...  At that point she was five days late. This was day six.  Now if Lily was already uneasy about joining the Ericksen family, imagine how she felt about possibly having a 15-pound Ericksen growing inside of her.  But Lily knew way down the road might not be so far down the road.  So she headed down the road.  So that was Thanksgiving 2005. To be honest, it didn't go great. But like has plenty of good parts. It's the rough parts that make you thankful that you have people to share it with.  And that, kids, is the true story of how I met your mother."
144,1,9,judy ,"Oh dear, what for? Marshall: Public urination."
145,1,9,kendall ,"Barney, we need you out front. There is a logjam on the stuffing line. Can you show them how it's done? Every Sunday, all year long. He's our best volunteer Go home, we're full. On the biggest volunteer day of the year, yeah, you can. Fine, but I'm not promising anything. Wait here, we'll let you know if we need you. Barney, you need me to sign your time sheet, right? Amanda! I called dibs on the Portobello mushrooms. I know, and I'm starving."
146,1,9,lily ,"Well, I just ralphed. He hasn't been back home to Minnesota since Christmas. He's a little excited. Yeah, no, it'll be fun. Did I? No, I, I love Marshall's family. But, yeah, no, it'll be great. Yeah, no, shut up. Oh, Barney. Did you check your suitcase? Wow, I forgot how tall you guys are. Here I am. (Lily raises her hand) You're gonna go play hockey? With a basketball? Baskiceball? Not iceketball? Oh, well maybe that's just 'cause you haven't seen me play. Well, that's funny because your brother throws like a girl. Thank you. It'll go great with my...I just love it. Oh, I make this great frisee and endive salad with a coriander lime vinaigrette. Seven-layer salad? Six cups of mayonnaise? That can't be right. Go. OK, I finished the gummy bear layer of the salad. What's next? Potato chips. Baby? Uh, you know, I hadn't really thought about it at all. Well, I just ralphed. Yeah, I mean, I'm way too young to have a baby, right?  Oh my. That's a big baby, Judy.  Twins. Twins! Three months! Three months? And she's already pregnant again. Yeah, well, well, not literally because, you know, I'm keeping my name. No, I've decided and I'm keeping my own name. Oh, sure, in St. Cloud but our kids aren't gonna be growing up in St. Cloud. Right, baby? Oh, so is New York. What? It is. And we grew up just fine. And we grew to the proper size and then we stopped. But, Marshall, you love New York. Yeah, to Brooklyn. I need to go to the restroom. Happy Thanksgiving. As in check out the chick buying the knock-up test everybody, wonder what must be going through her head. Yeah, well, since you asked, a family of mayonnaise-guzzling giants is trying to suck me into their suburban nightmare. And there's a solid chance that I have an Ericksen the size of a 15-pound turkey growing inside of me. Fantastic. I'm sorry I just yelled at you. You mind if I use your bathroom? So what do you do when you have to...? OK, I'll tell you but before I do, promise me that we are not gonna move to St. Cloud, Minnesota, promise. Just promise. Because I don't fit in here. I'm not eight feet tall and I don't think you can call it a salad if it has Funyuns in it. Pete arrested me before I could look at it. Yeah. Yeah, what are the rules to that game, anyway? Marshall: There are no rules, we just wail on each other. Great, now I'm crying. Look, we may have some really big decisions to make in about 10 seconds but right now, I don't care where our kids grow up as long as they have you for a father. Gosh, I hope you're the father. Just a little joke to lighten up the mood. Thank God.  And hey!"
147,1,9,marcus ,"It's baskiceball, OK? And I'm the best."
148,1,9,marshall ,"It's like Thanksgiving in my mouth. The shuttle's here! Baby, we're holding up the shuttle, do you have everything you need? Toothbrush, pajamas, underpants. Underpants. Where are all my underpants? Let's go. Hello, we're home! We invented it. It's the most dangerous and awesome sport in the world. You wish. I don't know honey, it's not really a sport for a girl. Oh my God, there is some serious baskiceball going on out there. Dad totally nailed Marcus in the face with a snowball, which is a foul because you only get one snowball per possession, so I nailed him in the shin with my skate and I totally dunked it. You having fun? Lily: Yeah, but I kinda miss you. Could you stay in here for a little bit? Yeah, yeah yeah, no problem, it's halftime. Thanks baby. Oh, isn't this great? Can't you see why everybody from my high school stays in this town? Hey Marvin, you're the dorko, dorko! He's been drinking his milk. Dad, you're embarrassing me. Well, we haven't actually decided anything yet so... Why not St. Cloud? I mean, I loved growing up St. Cloud. St. Cloud is a great place to have a childhood. Yes, I do. But you always said that when we had kids, you wanted to move out of Manhattan. Why are we even talking about this? This is way down the road. Lily, the restroom's the other way. Lily. Lily! Lily's been arrested. Thanks, Pete. You all right? Lily: No. I embarrassed myself in front of your family and now I'm celebrating Thanksgiving in probably the most depressing place ever. Well, I'm glad that you're safe. Hey, weird question, why did you drive three miles down Route 23 and take a pee behind a convenience store? Look, I'm not suggesting that we move here tomorrow. I'm just... Why do you want me to promise you that? I'm Funyuns and mayonnaise and gummy bears and baskiceball and I love St. Cloud. And yes, there is a part of me that would like to move here someday, and why are we having this discussion in a jail cell on Thanksgiving? Whoa. Lily, we can't let our kids play baskiceball. Baskiceball is really dangerous. Look, I don't wanna be exactly like my family, and don't take this the wrong way, but I don't wanna be exactly like your family either. What does it say? Lily: I'm afraid to look."
149,1,9,marvin ,"And I hope you like the taste of stick, dorko."
150,1,9,pete ,"No problemo Marsh. OK, personal effects, one wallet, one cell phone, one pregnancy test.  It's negative."
151,1,9,robin ,"How much did you guys drink last night? Lily, you just said, ""yeah, no."" Wait, so you're not going home for Thanksgiving. I'm Canadian, remember? We celebrate Thanksgiving in October. You guys are the world's leader in handgun violence, your healthcare system is bankrupt and your country is deeply divided on almost every important issue. So, probably hanging out with Barney then? That's awesome. This is gonna be great. This is a joke, right? You don't actually volunteer here. What? Ted: We're volunteers, we're unpaid help. Can you really ever have enough unpaid help? Come on, we just wanna help out. Yesterday you said the best feeling on earth was getting your toes sucked. Then you requested a high-five with your foot. I do charity work all the time. Remember when I said I'd find you a girlfriend. I'm working on it. I'm gonna introduce you to that girl you've been staring at. Have you met Ted? Oh, um, I'm not his girlfriend. I used to be but, um, I just wasn't enough woman for Ted, emotionally or sexually. Oh my God. Hey, we're in business. Yeah. Now, all's right with the world again. Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends. Surprisingly good. Ted. Are you listening? You're a good guy. You said you wanted to see the joy in someone's eyes. Thanksgiving in November. Weird."
152,1,9,ted ,"Not how much? What. You want a good holiday drink, try his Kwanzaapolitan. So, Lil, Marshall's family. Whole weekend with the future in-laws, you excited? You just did it again. No, I have to work on Friday. You? Oh, right, I forgot you guys are weird. You pronounce the word out, ""oat"" Your cops are called Mounties. No, Barney's got his own Thanksgiving tradition. I think I'm gonna go to a homeless shelter, serve food. Yeah, I thought I'd just spend the day giving back, you know, doing some good. Exactly. I know. I'm so psyched we did this. Look at all these people, giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man. These have got to be the best people in New York. Barney? What are you doing here? But you're Satan. Wait, so, this is real. Barney does this? Anyway, uh, we're psyched to be here, Kendall. What do you need us to do? Hey, Barn? What do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit? This is crazy. When did it get so hard to do charity work? Ha ha. Delightful. How is that little project coming along anyway? What? That's crazy, I haven't been staring at any girl... Hi, I'm the aforementioned Ted, and this is... Hi. Well, I've been...nothing. I do nothing. So, Amanda, what do you need us to do? Got it. Consider it sorted. Hey, Barney's not gonna get all the glory today. Let's start with this one. Hey, Amanda, what's this box for? In your car, um, then you'll take it... People donated this food thinking it was going to feed the hungry. Barney. You have a time sheet. No one else has a time sheet. All right, let me see that. Court-mandated community service. You peed on a church? Oh, you are evil. Kendall, ah, Kendall, Amanda is stealing Portobello mushrooms from homeless people. Those are for the hungry. Mushrooms. Mushrooms. Portobello mushrooms for everybody! Take them and run! They're very expensive! You can't fire a volunteer. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just tell me, I'll do it. Public urination. Who gets arrested for public urination? You wanna know why I have to work tomorrow? My firm's designing an executive lounge for a tobacco company. In the fight against cancer, I'm on the side of cancer. Are you joking? No, Barney, that's insane. Sir, would you like me to buy you a ticket to the buffet. You know, I don't think I'm gonna watch. Here you go, Walter. Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving, guys. Uh, no thanks. You want some yams? I'm Ted. Still Ted."
153,1,9,walter ,"No, I'm stuffed. Just a lap dance would be fine. Thank you so much. No really, thank you."
154,1,9,,"Robin, Ted: Oh. Mr. Ericksen: Where's my almost daughter-in-law? Mr. Ericksen: You got yourself a great little bride here, son. Mr. Ericksen: All right now, no farting around. Put your skates and your pads on, boys. Game on in five minutes. Mr. Ericksen: Well, it's a combination of the two. We call it baskiceball. Mr. Ericksen: Iceketball? Just sounds weird. Mrs. Ericksen: (quietly) Marcus! Mrs. Ericksen: Oh, I almost forgot. I know it's early but you are a future Mrs. Ericksen. Mrs. Ericksen: OK, Lily, we're putting you on salad duty. Pregnant Mrs. Ericksen: But this is an American holiday. Mrs. Ericksen: Now that you're going to be a Mrs. Ericksen, I'm going to let you in on a secret recipe. The Ericksen family seven-layer salad. Mrs. Ericksen: Oh no, dear, sixteen cups. Mrs. Ericksen: Mayo's in that cabinet. Mr. Ericksen: Yeah, you were sitting pretty until I whacked you with that mallet. Mr. Ericksen: (to Mrs. Ericksen) Hey Gorgeous! Mr. Ericksen: Oh, halftime's over. Get yours butts out here, come on. Mrs. Ericksen: So, Lily, when are you gonna start thinking about having a baby? Mrs. Ericksen: Oh, are you kidding? I was younger than you when I had Marcus. Beautiful 15 pound boy. Not much bigger than this turkey right here. Mrs. Ericksen: The doctor thought he was twins. Ted:... gone. Mr. Ericksen: Amen. Pregnant Mrs. Ericksen: Look who came to say good-night. It's little Martin. Three-months old. Mr. Ericksen: Well, that's 'cause those Ericksen boy's boys can swim. They've got two tails and a drill bit for a head. Mr. Ericksen: Ah, son, she's cool. She's gonna be an Ericksen. Mrs. Ericksen: But the apron. Mr. Ericksen: But Ericksen is a great last name. People know the Ericksen's.  Marshall: We'll be our own family, and we'll find our own way to freak out the people our kids bring home. Daughter, Son: What?!"
155,1,10,barney ,"No, no. That's ridiculous. You gonna put out? What? There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills. What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go. Daddy's home. Yeah. Hm. Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.  Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy, huh? Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do. Totally. Oh yes it can. Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style. Oh no. I want you to do five shots. No, don't think. Do. I love it, I love it, I love it. No....Dammit. No, no, that's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk. You do things you would never do in a million years if you were sober. Ding, class dismissed. Here you go, kid, you call whoever you want. Hello. The porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling. Don't worry, I slept through it. (laughs) I totally didn't sleep through it. For a little girl, you've got a big tank. Oh, you put Ted to bed all right. Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now. All right, game face on. Carl, two more. All right, all right, what do we think of this one? Ehhh! Trick question, no thinking. You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride. Have you met Ted? You're calling Robin. Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her. If you complete that call, I will set your coat on fire. Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast. You got robbed, this is a blend. Who is she? Nice. No, after I hosed you down with a beverage g*n, I brought you back here. Sleep it off, bra. Oh come on. You've gotta give me this one. Those five shots got you farther with Robin than your brain ever did. See what happens when you don't think? You do! More importantly, you do Robin. Come on. Someone get him a shot, he's thinking again. Daddy's home. Daddy's home. OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy. Ladies. Robin. Top of the morning. I'm good."
156,1,10,carl ,"On the house. It's my own concoction. I call it the Red Dragon. And how did you guys like the shots? If he pukes, one of you guys cleans it up. It's Carl, from the bar. Give me your arm. This way, if you pass out in the gutter... Someone will call me and I will come get you. Excuse me? Yeah, this'll go good."
157,1,10,everyone ,"Whoa. Wow. Thanks, Carl."
158,1,10,future ted vo," Now I remember a lot of stories from back in the days before I met your mother, but there's one story I don't remember. Uncle Marshall still refers to it as the pineapple incident.  And that's all I remember, except for a few hazy memories.  But really, the next thing I remember is waking up the following morning.  So, there were some unanswered questions.  How much did I drink? How did I sprain my ankle?  And who was this girl in my bed?  So, Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily filled me in.  And then Carl filled us in.  And then Trudy filled us in.  I left Trudy a message but she never called me back. That's just how life works sometimes. You turn off your brain for a night, and all you're left with is a bad hangover, a sprained ankle.  Oh, and we never found out where that pineapple came from, but it was delicious."
159,1,10,guy ,"Hello. You called me, who's this?"
160,1,10,lily ,"I hope not. These look kinda like blood. I'll say, she's going out with a billionaire. Yeah, $2000 a plate. I think my soul just threw up a little bit. Bye. Garlic fries. Guys, you are being immature and moronic and drink, drink, drink No dibs. (Lily puts index finger on her nose) Who are you calling? Says every girl you've ever slept with. Friends don't let friends drink and dial. You'll get this back at the end of class. Was that necessary? He is not making smart decisions. Barney: Exactly. It's like, what's he gonna do next. I don't know, but I want to find out. And then we brought you home and put you to bed. There's a girl in there. Who is she? That girl in there is alive, right? Ted: I should call Barney, maybe he knows what happened. Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night? Good night, Ted. (reading what's on Ted's arm) Hi, I'm Ted, if lost, please call...Who's number is that? All right, right over here. You know who might have something to say about Ted's future with Robin? Robin. Go wake her up. Wait, this is k*ll*ing me. We have to find out who that girl is. Hi Robin. Let's go get a snack."
161,1,10,marshall ,"OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire? I'm serious. Think about it. He always wears black, we never see him in the daylight, only after dark. You OK? I don't know. Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire. OK, think about this, is there even a single item on the menu that has garlic in it? OK, well, I'll get back to you. Doo-doo. Interesting Oooh, more interesting. Ted, he's right. You overthink. Maybe you should overdrink. You really don't remember, Superbrain?  I love drunk Ted. Oh. (Marshall puts index finger on his nose) Oh, bad idea.  Say what?! Wow, right, that's why we don't do shots. Cheap Trick? Oh Ted. And we love you, drunk Ted. And a pineapple. How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around one. Love you too, buddy. And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple? Dude, call it. Hold on, I'm gonna make some popcorn. OK, you can call now. God, this is intense, I love it. Did you guys? Maybe it's not such a bad idea to think about this one. You and Robin went down this road before, you got dinged up pretty bad. Good luck buddy. Ask her about the pineapple. Dammit, Trudy, what about the pineapple? Sorry. I love to snack."
162,1,10,robin ,"Oh my God, that does describe a vampire, or you know, a bartender. Well, I should go get dressed. Lily, I told you not to call him that. He's not a billionaire. He's a hundred millionaire. Why do people always round up? A charity dinner. $1500, Stop rounding up. And it's for third world hunger. Well, I'm gonna be late. You guys have fun. Bye. Oh hi Ted. Hi Ted. Sounds like you're having fun. Listen, Ted, I can't really talk right... '93? Dude, that's impressive. That's sweet and odd. But I'm kinda on a date right now. Bye Ted. Hello again, Ted. Ted? Ted, for the last time, stop. Ted! Ted, it's Robin. Ted, I think you and I should have a talk about those phone calls last night. Do you mind if I swing by? Thanks. Hey guys. No kidding. Those calls were really weird. Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk. That goes on for three-and a half minutes. Ted, you can't do this. Please, we're to be friends and now you're making it all confusing. Really, you moved on? Wait, you were with someone last night? Ted: Yeah, Trudy, she's cool. Hi Trudy, I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you. You're right, she is shy. Then why did you hide her from me? Ted: Wow, you're good. Did anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 Minutes? Yes, you did, last night. Get some sleep, Ted. You had a long night. And don't feel bad, I've woken up with worse."
163,1,10,ted ,"We're not really doing shots, are we? Where are you going, buddy? Hot date? Wait, you're really going out with a billionaire? So, uh, where's Thurston Howell taking you? See ya. Sure, why? OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for... Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line? Daddy's home? You want us to go over there right now and say to those girls, 'daddy's home.' Really think about that, Barney. Oh, daddy's back. See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that... That worked. I hate the world. So, I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped. So, what? You want me to do a shot. Barney, I think you've officially... Ah, Lily, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being? Let me tell you something about this brain, OK? Even alcohol cannot stop this brain. This brain, dear mortals, is no ordinary brain. This is a superbrain. This brain is unstoppable. This brain... OK, what the hell happened last night? I drank all five, bitch. Marshall thinks you're a vampire. How quickly you all forget. I haven't puked since high school. I am vomit-free since ninety-three. Vomit free since ninety-three. That's funny. I'm funny. Robin. Hello Robin, it's Ted. Hello Robin, it's Ted. Robin, have I ever told you that I'm vomit-free since ninety-three? I don't say this enough, but you're a great woman, and a great reporter. You should be on 60 Minutes. You should be one of the minutes. Yeah, and I disagree with Barney. Just 'cause this guy is spending a lot of money doesn't mean you have to put out. Take it slow, Robin, take it slow. Slow. Slow. I need that phone back. Thank you kind sir. At least someone appreciates the fact that I'm doing and not thinking. And now I don't think I won't not go to the bathroom. Hey, it's me again.  Plain to see again.  Please can I see you every day?  I love everyone in this bar.  I'm a fool again.  I fell in love... Well, that explains the ankle. Was there anyone else in there with me? I know. I know. I don't know. What the hell happened to my jacket? Marshall: Whoa. Why are you sleeping in our tub? You guys take care of me. You guys are the best. I love you guys so much. I'm back baby doll! I think.... Bring it. I'm calling Robin. Oh yeah? What you gonna do? You're bluffing. Hello, Robin, it's Ted. You set me on fire. You set me on fire. And who's the girl in my bed? I have no idea. You really don't know who that is? I better not have gotten burned. Did any of you write that? I don't know. Uh, hi, who is this? It's Ted. Barney, you've always taken care of me. You are a gentleman and a scholar. Go into my stable and take my finest stallion. He's yours, his name is Windjammer. I'm back, baby doll! Ted: And I am gonna throw up. I threw up? My streak is over. Vomit-free since '05 doesn't sound good. Sorry, Carl, go on. Carl, did you know the word karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra? Isn't that hauntingly beautiful? Are you a vampire? Carl: I am cutting you off. Go home and get some sleep, Ted. Yeah, sun's gonna come up soon. Wouldn't want to be around for that, would we? Hey, how easy do you think it'll be to sneak into the zoo? I have to see some penguins, like right now. That tickles. Thanks Carl. We can't just be friends, we're attracted to each other and we both know it. Me and Robin. Me and Robin, I have to make one more call. Hey, it's me again. Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life, so shy don't you come over to my apartment and we'll think of something stupid to do together? Really? Great. Wait, really? Great. Thanks Carl. It's Robin. That's Robin in there. Still, what does this mean? Are we dating now? I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it... Wake her up and say what? Hello. Are you sure? Hey, Robin, how are you? Yeah, sure, come on over. No, wait, don't, no. She's coming over. Crap. I love everyone in this bar. What are you doing in the men's room? What am I doing in the ladies' room? Oh right, I came in here 'cause I thought I was gonna throw up. I did not. And the streak continues. Vomit-free since '93. Sorry, Trudy, go on. What? The karaoke? Domo arigato. Do it. I'm something stupid, do me. Hey, can I call you sometime? Trudy: OK. Why do they call it karaoke anyhow? Was it invented by a woman named Carrie Okie? These are the kinds of things I think about. Trudy: Karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra. That's hauntingly beautiful. Hey, it works. I need to make one more call. Hey, it's me again. Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life. Uh, Robin's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom. No, that's not my girlfriend. Look, it's complicated. No, I'm not married. Um, I'll explain after you hide. Hi. Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was very drunk. Come on, those calls weren't that weird.  Robin! Come hang out! OK, I'm gonna make this sound until you come hang out. Without a breath? That's gotta be some kind of record. No I'm not. Look, I just turned off my brain for the night. Nothing's changed, you've moved on, I've moved on. Yes. What, you don't believe me? Oh, OK. Trudy, come on out. Trudy, come on out. Seriously, it's OK. This is so Trudy. She's really shy, I think. Trudy? I'm not making this up. She must have climbed out the fire escape. Whatever, whatever. I don't care what you think. Really? Well."
164,1,10,trudy ,"Trudy. My name is Trudy. I know, it's two years of my life I'm never getting back. A little part of me just wants to jump the bones of the next guy I see. Or the one after that. He's kinda cute. Did you? I liked your performance. I wish I had your guts, getting up and making a complete idiot of myself. I don't know. Still, I've had a pretty serious week. I could sure stand to do something stupid. You're funny. Then I guess you're gonna have to call me. Hello. Hey. So I came over here. And now I'm really, really embarrassed. Why, is that your girlfriend? You're married. Yeah, I can't believe I did this."
165,1,10,trudy's friend, I'm just surprised you didn't dump him sooner.  Look at that idiot go.
166,1,10,,"Marshall, Barney: Drink, drink, drink, drink... Marshall, Lily, Barney: Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink... Marshall, Lily, Barney: Yes! Drink, drink, drink... Marshall, Lily, Barney: Drink! Drink, drink... Marshall, Lily: Drink, drink, drink... Marshall, Lily, Barney: Drink, drink, drink, drink... (Lily and Marshall sitting in living room area, Ted walks in from his room) Lily: There's our rock star (Barney gestures behind him and finds that Ted's not there, sees Ted standing by jukebox with his phone) Barney: Excuse me. (Barney looks at Lily and Marshall and Ted, stumbles over to Ted's room and peeks in, closes door and stumbles back to living room) Barney: There's a girl in your bed.  Trudy: Here, let me.  Ted: You are gonna laugh."
167,1,11,all ,"No! Come on! Come on! Cheers. Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year!"
168,1,11,barney ,"Question? But you enjoyed the e-vite, right? Thas an actual picture of my pants. People often ask me ""Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"" And the answer is right here... my own, personal ""get psyched"" mix. Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong. It should be all rise, baby. Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline. Bam. Let's do this! Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now. That's awesome. Hey, what are we waiting for? We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it. Party number one! Natalya. She... Who knows? The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan? Isn't she awesome? It's true. I can hear them. What's that, little boys? What's that? You wanna go for a... rock? Oh, wait, wait, wait. We have to turn around. We left Natalya. What?! Oh, very nice, Lily. You know, she is a guest in this country. So while you may chose to turn your back on her, I choose to turn my front on her. What up? What? She needs to get psyched. Fine. My finger slipped. We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs? No. No. We are already behind schedule. Ted, come on. We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit. Oh, my God. He's coming over. Everybody be cool. Everybody be cool. Big fan. Barney Stinson. So, uh... what about this party? Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher. This mix is my pride and joy. I never leave home without it. Jan... Aah! But when we said, ""Hey, Moby,"" you said, ""Yeah."" No, uh, we're good. We're good. Happy New Year, Not Moby. Why did we think that guy was Moby? That's Marshall's phone. Hello. Hey, sexy. He left his phone in the limo. He's out looking for you. Party number three. Moby?! She's upstairs. Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony. Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for? It's time to... what? That's right, re-psych. Re-psy... Where's the...? Oh, my God! Not Moby took my ""Get Psyched"" mix! Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world. Everyone except Barney. Oh, sure, laugh. Laugh for Barney Stinson. Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze. Round and round it goes. And where's it all heading? Nowhere. I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side? The first time I rode in a limo I was five. I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral. I suppose, in a way, I still am. Give it a rest, Ted. Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve which is the single biggest letdown of a night every single year. Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted. It doesn't exist. Come on! Oh! Oh! Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time. Ranjit, why didn't you tell me? Cheers. Well said. Here, you need a mint."
169,1,11,derek ,"Hey. I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight. I made it, baby."
170,1,11,lily ,"Yeah. All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth? By who? Who asks you that? It's working. Bye. Well, this kind of sucks. We didn't really get a chance to meet. I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall. You're, you're friendly. Oh, no. So, where are you from, Natalya? Okay, I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep. Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change? Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking. Barney, none of us really liked her. Sorry. What happened? Which is exactly how much time I need. Ranjit, stop the car. I'm going home. I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't. There's a cab over there. I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes. Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one. No, baby. Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at... party number three. If I don't see you, happy new year. I know we will. (Lily leaves the limo) Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through. Barney, where's Marshall? What? Where? Well, I'm here at party number three and... Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in... Moby! Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo... Does he have a g*n? Who was that guy?! No, but I was just at party number three. I wish Marshall would call. I guess the circuits are jammed. I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight. Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here. I'm going to call Marshall. Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Baby, baby, I was so worried about you. Why didn't you call me? Natalya? Move, you stupid taxi!"
171,1,11,marshall ,"Oh, God. I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage. Must do robot. I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets. If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones. My word. How are your feet doing, baby? Let's go back to party number one. Oh, dude, not now! Yeah, we like hot dogs. Wait. Baby, what are you doing? But... hot dogs. Okay, I'll go with you. Are you sure? Don't say that. We'll find each other. We'll find each other. Hell of a woman. Let's go get some hot dogs! Oh, yeah! Look at us. Riding around in a limo. Eating hot dogs. It's like we're the president. Guys. Is that Moby? I think that that's Moby. Uh, Ted. Sidebar? What about Lily? I've been trying to call her. I can't get through. All the circuits are jammed. No, I-I can't. Lily's waiting. I gotta... I gotta find her. Okay, I'll meet you at party number three. Lily! I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually. So much to tell. I couldn't find Lily at party number three so I walked... I walked to the next party on the list. Yes, Moby's party. Check it out. He signed my shirt. And guess what I found. Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it. Yeah, I know. Come on. I tried, baby. All the circuits were jammed. But wait, there's more. After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five. And so I went there, too, and it is awesome. I want to cry, it is so awesome. We have to go there. Three minutes!"
172,1,11,mary beth," Hi. Mary Beth. So great to meet you guys.  American party friends of Barney's.  No, I'm having a great time. I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.  Mary Beth.  I'm going to get some air.  Ted, I'm going to head out. My roommates are having a party not far from here.  How long have you been in love with Robin?  Ted, it's okay. I'm fine. And I can tell that she's into you, too.  Happy New Year, Ted."
173,1,11,moby ,"Hello. Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown. Sure. Wow. You're friendly. It's just a New Year's thing. You know, with some friends. You guys want to come? All right. This is a cool mix. You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall. I think it should be all rise. Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here. So then I say, ""your motorcycle was like that when I got here."" Who? No."
174,1,11,natalia ,"I super love you, okay?"
175,1,11,natalya ,"Oh, friendly. Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?"
176,1,11,not-moby," I thought you said ""Tony.""  No. Oh, hey, we're here. All right. You guys going to come in?  You're sure? Come on. It's going to get nuts in there. There's this dude who owes me money.  Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe."
177,1,11,ranjit ,"I've moved up in the world. Party number one! Party number two. Party number three. Yeah. You don't know what you're missing. Stopping the car. Party number three. Moby's party. Where to? Party number three! Ah, nuts. No. I am pissed. Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed. *A bad name* The flat's fixed. I didn't want to awake her. She looked so peaceful. I get you there in six. I don't think I can do it."
178,1,11,robin ,"Oh, man, Ted, this is great. Mary Beth? How do you guys know each other? Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up. Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun. Ted, Derek stood me up. Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this. You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up. Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal. Who works on New Year's Eve? Okay. Now I feel worse. I was really looking forward to this night. This sucks. Maybe I should just go home. Hi, I'm Robin. You're friendly. I haven't eaten dinner yet. Is there anything to eat in this thing? Oh, yes. Ted, you rock. Oh, so much better. That's totally Moby. That's awesome. Wow, that sounds awesome. Moby... the recording artist, Moby. Is this just 'cause you lost your ""Get Psyched"" mix? No. No, not tonight. Not in the limo. We got to stay psyched. Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's. (singing...) *Shot through the heart And you're to blame, darling* I'm sorry about your girl. Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight. Did you forget about our little deal? Because I did not. Derek. Hi. How's work? Derek?! Derek. I can't believe you made it. What the hell, man? I thought we had a deal. Eh, he kept me waiting. I can keep him waiting. Happy New Year."
179,1,11,ted ,"Yeah, that's right...a limo. Okay, people, let's talk strategy. Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked. This year we party together or not at all. Now, I sifted through your party submission and I narrowed them down to these five. Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants. We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City and that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year. Oh, she works in my office. She seems like she might be into me. She's always finding reasons to hug me. So tonight... I am definitely getting psyched. Yes! Let's! Oh, driver? Oh, we rode in his cab one time. It's a long story. See ya next year. Go get 'em. Okay, nobody get down. We knew this going in. We're a man down. That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder. Ranjit! Party number one. Hey, we've got four more parties to hit. If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it. So, Barney, who's your new friend? Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us. I need you to power through the pain. Ranjit! Party number two. Party number two? Not so good. No, no turning back. Ranjit, party number three. I'm sorry about Barney. Me, too. (Ted's phone starts ringing) Hey, Robin. Ranjit, turn it around. No, this is perfect. It's meant to be. We're all back together. Look, Robin, you're not going home. Come on, it's New Year's Eve. Look, so your date fell through. So what? What do you need a date for? Someone to kiss at midnight? Fine. I'll kiss you at... a little bit after midnight. That's it. I know what you're jonesing for. Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya! Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour. What? No! Ranjit, party number three. Hey. I'll bet you're feeling better now. No way. Should I say something? I should say something, right? Moby! Hey, Moby! Hey. What's up? Uh, you, uh, going somewhere? You want a ride? Welcome. Yeah, we'd love to. Um... Moby, switch up, will you? Yeah, what's up? Call her. That's New Year's Eve for you. Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards... But... Come on! Moby's party! Moby's party! Moby's par... Ranjit. Moby's party. You're not Moby, are you? So your name is Tony? Nah. I don't know. I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby. Lily, you have to get out of there this instant. That's not Moby. Run! Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four. What are the odds? Ranjit, drive! Party number three! No, no, no, no you were at party number four. You must have looked at the list wrong. Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it! Let it go. We need to get back on schedule. Ranjit, are you sure I can't help? Okay Okay, not a problem. He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time. It'll be fine. We'll be out of here in a jiff. No. Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but... I'm not in love... We're just friends. Where are you getting that from? That's ridiculous. Wait. Really? Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party. It's no big deal. But he left his phone. Sorry about your guy. I did not, too. I'll give you some privacy. Okay, how's this for a plan? We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45. We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time. Give what a rest? Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around. We've still got ten minutes. Holy crap. Not Moby's party? How? We'll never get a cab. Let's do this! Come on! In! Go, go, go! Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town. Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes? Ranjit, put her in park. Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome, but it's not the best party in New York. 'Cause this is, right here. Hey, uh, come on in. What about your guy? It's midnight. Go kiss him. Well, a deal is a deal. Happy New Year."
180,1,11,ted and robin," *You give love a bad name*  *I play my part and you played your game*  *Darling, you give love a bad name, bad name!*"
181,1,11,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks. Sure, it looks great on TV, but in reality, it's always just a big let down, but in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible, to give my friends a great New Year's Eve. I had an idea of how to do it, too. And all it cost was half my Christmas bonus. Ted from 2030: Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend, Derek. Derek. He was like rich, successful, handsome. I hated that guy. Ted from 2030: Pfft. Derek. Now, we had a tight schedule to keep that night and I was already on a date with another girl. But... it was Robin. Ted from 2030: Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young. Ted from 2030: And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve. The funny thing is all night long, I'd been trying to chase something down that was right there in that limo. Ted from 2030: You probably want to feel bad for your old man at this point in the story. Well, don't. Not every night has a happy ending. But all of it's important. All of it was leading somewhere. Because suddenly, it was 2006. And 2006 was a big one."
182,1,12,barney ,"Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah. You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date. Ted, it's a simile. Don't beat yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you. What I don't get is, why is Claudia marrying Stuart? She's way hotter than him. How way? Way way. What? What up? Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years. Invigorating, thanks. But to be fair, she's also hot. Yeah, right. Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain? Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move... A little Barney. And you know what he said? (changing tone of voice) ""Ted, you will bring no dates to this wedding. You will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney."" Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up. Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just... (to bartender) two vodka cranberries. Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?  They all drink vodka cranberries. So, is there anything else you need, sweetie? No, but I do have a hug. (looking up, whispers) Thank you. That's just, that's... (yelling over to bartender) two more vodka cranberries please. Claudia, it's all gonna be OK. Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle. Oww Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each. All right, all right. Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen. Those two eight's right over there. Yeah. Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids. Being single's the best. Answer to no one. Never having to go to a farmer's market. OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me..."
183,1,12,claudia ," Yes, I want Tahitian vanilla. You wrote it down wrong? No no no no no, listen to me. If I go to my wedding and the cake is not Tahitian vanilla, I will come down there and burn your little shop to the ground. Do you wanna find out if I'm kidding? Good-bye. You should be, lots of single girls. What? Ted: I'm bringing a date. You're not bringing a date. Uh, no you're not. No you didn't. Ted, you did not check 'plus one', you are not bringing a date to my wedding. You are not bringing a guest, Ted. The guest list has been closed for months. Months! You absolutely did not check 'plus one'. If you had checked 'plus one', I would have called you to get the name of your guest so I could get the guest cards printed up. Did I call you to get the name of your guest? Is there a place card with her name card printed on it? What's she eating? You ordered the chicken, what did she order? Do you see how your story is full of holes? Don't make me hurt you Ted. You what? Always undermining me at every turn. And your mother, calling me all the time... My dad already paid for this huge wedding. He's gonna k*ll me. He's gonna k*ll Ted, then I'm gonna k*ll Ted. I wanna go somewhere and drink. You remembered I drink vodka cranberries. You got $400,000? Thanks for listening, Barney. Really means a lot to me. Stuart. I'm so sorry. I love you. Marshall said what? Hi Ted. We just wanted to get a picture with the woman who almost ended our relationship. By the way, I almost forgot. We found this."
184,1,12,future ted vo," When you're single and your friends start to get married, every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation. Will you be bringing a guest or will you be attending alone? What it's really asking is where do you see yourself in three months? Sitting next to your girlfriend or hitting on a bridesmaid? I always checked that I was bringing a guest. I was an optimist.  Of course I knew who I wanted to bring: Robin.  The big unanswered question in my life. Problem was, she was dating this really rich guy named Derek.  Pft, Derek.  OK, I wasn't going to say it in front of the guys but back then I really thought that's how it worked.  You put yourself and a girl you like in some romantic setting. The stars line up and shazam.  I know now that life is never that simple.  Now I wasn't there, but what I heard, it went something like this.  So there we were, two single guys doing our usual single guy thing. For whatever reason, I had let myself believe that this night would be a turning point, that this was the night that my life, my real life, would finally begin. Funny thing is, I wasn't totally wrong.  'Cause that night was just beginning."
185,1,12,lily ,"No, that's terrible, are you OK? Oh, because they were buried in a shallow grave. Ah, here we go. We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame. I thought so. A little girl? Yes, but I'm the bride so I win. Right. But I'm the bride, so I win. You're going. That's awesome. Oh my God, four days to find a dress? Well, if we leave now, we can still have a fighting chance. Let's do it. Hey. Wait, two things. First of all, I've been laying groundwork all afternoon, totally subtle, totally cool, not pushing, not even nudging. Just the theme of today is Ted rocks. And she's picking up on it lying down. Wait, no, thing number two. The dress, we got a dress. Go. So, the dress? What? Why didn't you check 'plus... But Robin is so excited. And the dress. Oh. OK, OK, we'll, we'll sneak her in. I wish we were ninjas. You can always ask Stuart. Sure, you guys have been friends for a long time, and it's 40% his wedding too. Honey, this magazine says more and more couples are opting to have nontraditional weddings out in the woods. Squirrels don't get married, Marshall. Nice. It may have been my idea. What? Stuart doesn't get a say. Oh, yeah, sure, on the stupid stuff, like who comes. Sure, there's plenty of room in the woods. What? Why? But...but you're the guy...oh. Ted's phone. Oh, hi Claudia. What? They broke up.  Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh. Answer it. Sweetie, just calm down. Do you wanna go somewhere and talk? OK, meet me at MacLaren's. I'll see you there. She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000. Oh, hell no. Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes. I'll give you the crab puffs. The crab puffs are good. We should totally have them at our wedding. Did we just start planning our wedding? We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce. My God, were you born without taste buds? (Marshall smiles and laughs) What?"
186,1,12,marshall ,"Yeah, do you need a drink or something? Not again. Come on, dude, we all know how this movie ends. Ted falls in love. Love kicks Ted in the sprouts. Roll credits. This wedding does sound pretty amazing though. Fancy hotel ballroom, everybody all dressed up. Oh yeah, OK, that's a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments. You know what, excuse me if I don't wanna get married barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-one's-gonna-drive-that-far. Yes, I want a ballroom and I want a band and I want shoes. Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together. Bye babe. Wow. Ted, no. Let it go. She's about to get married. She's got enough to worry about. The only thing you can do. Tell Robin she can't come. Well, if a magazine says so, we should go get married in the woods like a couple of squirrels. Like you could possibly know that. What? How? Oh, you went around the bride. ""Oh, this hornet's nest looks harmless. Maybe I'll poke it with a stick. Oh, look, some gremlins, let me go feed them after midnight."" Did you known about this? Ha! So you admit it, the groom should have an equal say. So I can invite whoever I want. So, it begins. Ted, focus. Well, feel terrible later. Right now, we gotta fix this. Lily, you go down to the bar and comfort Claudia. Ted and I will go and try to talk some sense into Stuart. Oh, come on, man, you don't mean that. Dude, who doesn't. Stuart, don't get married. I'm sorry. Being in a couple is hard and committing, making sacrifices, it's hard. But if it's the right person, then it's easy. Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life, that should be the easiest thing in the world. And if it's not like that, then she's not the one. I'm sorry. So, admit it, this wedding is both indoors and amazing. Crab puffs were incredible. Definitely. Hey, we just agreed on something. I think we did. Oh, I thought the red sauce was like aweome. I love you."
187,1,12,robin ,"Well, Derek and I just broke up. Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed. Thanks, I feel a lot better. Think I'll get that drink now. Well, makes sense. Ooh, 'plus one', you make it sound so romantic. Ted: Fine. You wanna be my date? Your date? I'd love to. Um, how fancy are we talking about here? Oh, I'll bring it. I'll bring it so hard the bride's gonna look like a big white bag of crap. Lily, I need a dress. I know, it's a su1c1de mission.  Just a second. Well, did I bring it? Or did I bring it? I think I brought it. That's what I was going for. I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're gonna have so much fun. Ted. Where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought. Oh, OK, well I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's gonna love them. Bye-bye. Wow yourself. Look who else brought it. Sorry. Hello. Oh my God, tonight? You're kidding. Robin: (to Ted) They want me to anchor the news tonight. Really? Like, anchor anchor? What happened to Sandy? OK, OK, sure, what time do you need me to...Right now! Oh. OK, I need like five minutes to change and um, I'll call you from the cab... Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break."
188,1,12,stuart ,"Dude, no problem whatsoever. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, this morning at the rehearsal, Claudia called our 7-year-old flower girl a whore. So, don't take it personally, she's just a little stressed. No. Uh, by the way, honey, Ted stopped by and I told him he could bring his date to the wedding. I told him he could bring a date to the wedding. Try to show a little flexibility, but no, it's all about you. You know what, the wedding's off. Ted, for all I know you did me the biggest favor anyone's every done me. Yeah, I do. This whole thing's made me realize, I miss being single. I miss staying out late and making messes and not cleaning them up. I miss owning p*rn. You know, I'll see some super-hot model chick and I'll think, ""why am I with Claudia? I can be with her."" The point is, I wanna get married, I wanna settle down. But right now, that's just not who I am. I'm not a commitment guy, I'm a single guy. How would you know, you're not even married? What? Claudia. I'm so sorry too. I love you too, babe. Marshall and Ted set me straight, and when Marshall told me not to marry you, it made me realize... He made me realize how much I love you. These guys got us back together. Yeah, where is she?"
189,1,12,ted ,"Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding? Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for? Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date, a $200 piece of chicken-slash-salmon will go uneaten. I gotta bring someone, but who? OK, guys, I gotta say something. I think my feelings for Robin may be resurfacing. No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture. Fact. Robin was into me when we first met. Fact. Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof. Fact. On New Year's Eve, we kissed again. Fact. I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship is to celebrate someone else's successful one. So, with that mind, our friends Claudia and Stuart are having this crazy, black-tie wedding on Saturday. You wanna be my 'plus one'? Oh, you're gonna wanna bring your A game. Whoa, did you see how fired up she was? I don't know, there's something there. And come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne. Who knows? Barney: Wow, Ted, you're gonna have to find another gender for yourself 'cause I'm revoking your dude membership. Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday? Hey, Claudia! Hey, how's it going? Claudia: My wedding's in two days, that's how it's going. Oh, don't worry, it's gonna be great. I'm so excited. Oh, well, yeah, I'm bringing a date, so I'll be off the market. Uh, yes I am. I checked 'plus one'. Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked... But I already invited someone. But I checked 'plus one'. I always check 'plus one'. She doesn't need a place card, she knows her name. Come on, Claudia, we go way back. Isn't there room for just one more person? I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy. I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did. I did. Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech. Please stop. I gotta call Claudia. If I just explain to her... Then what am I gonna do? Hey, listen. Lily's there's a problem. Wow. Yeah, about that. I don't have a 'plus one' for the wedding. I ran into Claudia and she told me I didn't check 'plus one' on the reply card. I did check 'plus one'. I know. I know. We can't sneak her in, we're not ninjas. I know. Can I do that? Oh, it's gonna be a tough sell. Really? Stuart: Sure, the more the merrier. Wow, wow, thanks for being so cool about this 'cause you know Claudia said... Yeah, she's not usually like that. Well, thanks, Stu, it's gonna be a great wedding. I did it. I did it. I'm taking her to the wedding. I talked to Stuart. It's Claudia. Come on, it can't be that bad. Here, Lily, you answer it. Because this whole thing was your idea. And Claudia scares me. Ow! It's not because of me, is it? It's Robin. Uh, Lily's phone. Uh, Lily's busy. That's great. I'll tell Lily to tell me. Uh, listen, I really wanna keep talking but now's not a good time so, um, I'm really excited about tomorrow. OK, bye. Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this. Do you think she's into me? I feel terrible. Tell Claudia I'm sorry. Did she seem pissed at me? Let's say we get these crazy kids back together. Stuart, I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way... That's crazy. I mean, you're the luckiest...you and Claudia both... Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other. Everybody feels this way sometimes. OK, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily. He's the pro. This guy knows relationships. Tell him, Marshall. Dude. You know I don't have $400,000, right? So, where did we land on the whole 'plus one' thing? Still wow. Oh yeah, I thought about leaving it at home, but I figured I don't wanna get there and realize I need it and have to go all the way back to get it, so, yeah, I brought it. Do it. Do it. What's a sixteen? Claudia. Um (clears throat) She couldn't make it. What's so funny? Claudia: Plan a wedding, you'll see. Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy. I didn't check 'plus one'. You were right. Barney: Of course I was right. I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single. Stay out as late as you want. The whole world full of endless possibilities."
190,1,12,,"(Barney and Lily high-five) Marshall: OK, I'm just saying, that it's my wedding too and I should have a say in it. Ted, Marshall: A little Barney.  Ted: I'll pick you up at five.  Claudia: Maybe we got together too young. Maybe that's what the problem was. I mean, I'm 28 years old. I've really only been with one man. (Claudia turns around and tries to attack Ted, Ted runs away) Future Ted VO: It took three more vodka cranberries to subdue Claudia but eventually she graciously agreed to let me bring Robin."
191,1,13,barney ,"Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, ""Is it?"" And usually they say, ""yes it is."" Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that. Ted, Ted, Ted, look, I got a bridesmaid, Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid, Ted, look. See ya Ted. This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what? Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste. You know I did. You know I won't. Because we just hooked up last night. I can't call the girl the next day. I have to wait at least, like, forever. Oh snap. Never gonna call her. Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India. Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night. Really? Ted: Yeah. But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing. Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial.  Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.  What kind of shoes...  Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing. Oh come on.  Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them. Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight. And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for s*x. I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately. Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up! Oh come on! Ted, you still with us? The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot."
192,1,13,claudia ,"Ted? Oh, you have got to be freakin kidding me. 24 hours ago, you were begging, begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding, and now, what, you're over her? What was her name? Was it my fat cousin, Lindsay? Don't be embarrassed. She has pretty eyes. Well, lucky for you, I know that guest list backwards and forwards. Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria at my wedding. Good-bye, Ted. Ted. I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier. My new husband and a vodka cranberry which cost $10.50 at the freakin' airport bar. When is this plane going to board?! Have helped me realize that sometimes I can act like a crazy person. And I don't want my new husband to think I'm a crazy person. Cake. We got it at this little bakery downtown. It's called the Buttercup Bakery."
193,1,13,future ted vo," Kids, in life there are a lot of big romantic moments, and they make life worth living. But here's the problem, moments pass, and lurking just around the corner from those moments is a cruel, unshaven b*st*rd named reality.  And so, back in 2006, on the night of Claudia and Stuart's wedding, reality was the enemy.  This wasn't how I thought the night would turn out.  This was finally supposed to be my big moment with Robin. But then reality came along.  Robin got called up last minute to anchor the 11 o'clock news. It was her big break.  And I went to the wedding stag. Then, when I least expected it...  And I thought that was the end of it, but then...  And then Lily told her the whole story, right down to the brown shoes with the little snowflakes on them, and by the end of it..."
194,1,13,lily ,"Hey, where the hell did you disappear to last night? Yeah, I know. My stomach was like, girlfriend, we don't always get along but that cake... Oh right. Most amazing night ever, and go. Oh, what is wrong with you? So, what happened next? So, that's what happened to the bouquet. You know, good for Victoria. It's such an evil tradition. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna take that flower grenade and chuck it into the crowd and scream, crawl for it, bitches. It's just what girls do. Oh, Ted, you're such a doof. I mean, this girl sounds amazing. Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon. She'll be back in two weeks. Call her then. No, Ted, you don't mess with a honeymoon. Maybe she used a second fake name. Oh, she's good, she's very good. Great. How do we get in touch with the bridesmaids? Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause. OK, let's not lose hope. We'll call the hotel, maybe she was staying there. We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria. Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori... Hey, there's the anchor lady! How was it? Congrats, that's so cool. Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact... What? You know who she is? But, you weren't even at the wedding. What? Because you have feelings for Ted. OK, what is wrong with the two of you?! Seriously. He likes you and you like him, just, just, just be together. Geez, Louise, happiness is not that difficult. Yes you do. Seeing him with someone else and crying about it. Guess what? That's how you feel. That is nothing but how you feel. Or you could tell him you're into him and then you could both be happy. Well, wait. Which one are you gonna tell him? No, no, don't do it. Well, I just think that maybe she's not that into you and that's why she didn't give you her number. Robin, care to chime in with anything? Robin: Yes. Ted. Go get her. Buttercup Bakery. This is it."
195,1,13,marshall ,"Tell me about it, that cake, best cake I ever had. Seriously. My stomach was like, hey bro, I don't know what you're eating 'cause I don't have any eyes but it's basically awesome so keep sending it down gullet alley. Say what? Oh. Dude, that is just like... a weenie ass idea. Ted, how do I explain this to you? Last night I had the best cake of my life. You think I'm gonna let that cake out of my life? Hell, no. I'm gonna find out what bakery made that cake and then I'm gonna get some more cake. It haunts me. So, where did you guys go? A drumroll? That's it. So, what, you just said good-night, came home, and performed a drum solo? So, let's get to work, man. What else do you know about her? Yeah, come on, dude. Ask her about the cake. Maybe she was a ghost. That's why she didn't wanna kiss you, because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second. Oh my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay. I know that she wasn't a ghost, she picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form. Or Ictor. Probably doesn't go by Ictor. Agreed. She made that cake. Ted, this is the girl. You gotta marry her, today. She has to move in with us. Baby, what are you talking about?! Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake."
196,1,13,nirvana ,Barney.
197,1,13,robin ,"Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor. Robin? Thanks, Robin, it was awesome. Back to you, Robin. Yeah, I felt really bad bailing on Ted though. I know who she is. Actually, I kind of was. Well, after the newscast, I was so excited, I decided to surprise Ted by going to the reception. Dammit. Stop it. What the hell? Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just allergies or something. I'm fine. Oh, thanks, but I don't actually cry in front of people, or cry at all for that matter. Man, it's gross. Does everyone snot up this much when they cry? I don't know, maybe. Oh, look, OK. Yes, I cried in the bathroom, and that was weird. But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy. The fact is I don't know how I feel. OK, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy? Lily: Kinda, yeah. But it doesn't change anything. I still don't wanna get married and he's still... Ted. What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he could be happy. I'm gonna go find him. I have no idea. Hi, guys, Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second? Uh, I, I have to tell you something. Oh, just get it. Thanks. You're very sweet. So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?"
198,1,13,stuart ,"Oh, here we go. Ted, it's Stuart. My lovely bride would like to say something to you. Sweet pea."
199,1,13,tanya ,"Wow, the Peace Corps? Barney, they are so right. I wish there was something I could do."
200,1,13,ted ,"I had the most amazing night ever. Lily. I'm guessing you haven't always had this rule. Exactly. Exactly, like, like just now, when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there, I'm not gonna lie to you, big time thunderbolt. Sadly not out of character. But I know now it's just a mirage. Exactly. And that, in a nutshell, is why I'm not putting the moves on you. What, you think this is the moves? Believe me, you'd know the moves. People ten tables away would know the moves. Tell me about it. Interested. Less interested. Go ahead. What are you saying? Unless... Wow. OK, I'm in. I guess, what, we'll need fake names? Pleased to meet you, Buttercup. I'm Lando Calrissian. Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded... So, I'm Ted. No last names. No, it was awesome. I had a great night, I'm never gonna see her again, and there's no way to ruin it. That cake really got to you, huh? Mm-hm. Yes, but we'll need a diversion. Kiss. Go. Go, go, go You're not gonna do it at your wedding? Very nice. I couldn't really tell. Well, it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight. No you couldn't. Totally get some. I will use exactly the right amount of tongue. OK. OK. She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and we connected on every level. And, I'm never gonna see her again. Dammit, I have to see her again. Nothing. Her name's Victoria, that's all I got. Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know. Yes, two weeks, good idea. I'm calling her now. I've moved on. Uh, no, her name was Victoria, I don't know her last name. Thank God. There was no Victoria at the wedding. Marshall. She was not a ghost. Wait, wait, wait, she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids. She must have been at their table. Maybe they know who she was? Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number? Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me. Why not? OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing. I'm ready to be proven wrong. Actually. So, what do you want to do next? Don't think...first thing that comes into your mind. Whoa. There she goes. I understand. No, you know what? This is fate. I am never supposed to see this girl again. That was the whole point of the night. I've just been saved from myself. Let's drink many beers. Hey. Sure. What's up? Oh. Hello. It's fine, Claudia. Don't worry about it. Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake. She made the cake. Buttercup Bakery. She wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest. She made the cake. I'm going down to that bakery. Yeah, all day long, you've been busting my apple bag about finding this girl. Going. Getting. Yes! No. Whoa. Guess we were gone a while. Why yes I am. Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking. Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux. You know, I don't look like this every day. On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it. Tell me your last name. You know, there's one little flaw in our plan. I'm gonna go home tonight with a lot of great memories and one really sucky memory: the memory of you walking out that door. Yeah? One, two, three, four, five. And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be... OK."
201,1,13,victoria ,"I should tell you, I have a rule. I never hook up at weddings. Well, here's the thing. Those big romantic moments, they're great when they happen, but they're not real. You should see me tap-dance. You'd be down on bended knee. Wedding goggles. This isn't the moves? That's too bad. You know, I think I have a solution. And, to preface this, we're not going to sleep together tonight. OK. So the thing that always screws it up is the next day, right? So, why don't we just cut that part out. I'm saying, I'm here, you're here, and this is a big, romantic wedding. Why don't we just dance and have a great time and then when it's over, never see each other again. No, no unless. No emails, no phone numbers, not even names. Tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished. And then, when we're old and gray, we'll look back on this night and it'll be perfect. OK. Um, you can call me Buttercup. Victoria. But no last names. Now let's see some of these moves I've heard so much about. Wait wait wait wait wait. Let's do all the single ladies in this joint a big favor and steal the bouquet. Yeah? OK, I don't really know how to tap-dance. Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some. You're a dude. I could totally... We're not gonna kiss tonight. If we kiss, all of this becomes real. You, you might use too much tongue, or not use enough and then suddenly, poof, spell's broken. OK, how about this? The best part of any first-kiss is the lead-up to it, the moment right before the lips touch. It's like a big drumroll. So, how about, tonight, we just stick with the drumroll. But we can't kiss. Hey. Uh... Hold this. Hello? You OK in there? Listen, do you wanna come and cry out here? I've been told I'm an excellent hugger. Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter. So, why are you crying? Why don't you take this? Sounds like you could use it. Actually, neither. I made the cake. Well, that's too bad. I was looking forward to one last dance. Wow, what was I thinking? You got me, you are good. The real Ted sounds real sexy. It's too bad I'll never get to see it. What's that? Hey, Ted. Close your eyes, and count to five. Oh thank God."
202,1,13,," Victoria: OK, ground rules have been established. Lily, Marshall: Yes.  Ted: Hey, Claudia, great wedding, beautiful toast, touching stuff. How's the honeymoon? Listen, I'm calling because last night I met this girl and I was wondering if you had..."
203,1,14,barney ,"Ted, the only reason to wait a month for s*x is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old. Really? Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say ""wow."" It's one of the many risks of the blind approach. It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot. But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship. You can't just... Wow! Not so fast, Scherbotsky. I like the way you think. That mirror thing. Simple. Elegant. Okay, limited-time offer: I need a ""bro"" for my bro-ings on about town. How would you like to be said bro? You suited up! Emilio? The woman will have... Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. ""The Torpedo."" Or, as the rollers call it, ""Piramide."" Father issues. Hot. Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl. What up! Freeze frame high five! Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still... There is one other thing we could do. If you're up for it. Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months. Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you? No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does. Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky. Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel? All right. Neither have I. Of course I cheat. Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other. Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt. Oh, my mistake. Or is it? Right. Hey. Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else. Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release. Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores. Hit! Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake. Hard-core? That's the only way I play. (Barney strips down) I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me? Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night. You invited me up to your apartment to ""play Battleship."" Is that not an internationally recognized term for s*x? Great. I hope you're happy. You sunk my battleship. But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well. I checked with Ted. Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well, I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right? I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin, you'd be cool with that, right? Totally gave us his blessing. Really. Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh... You like Ted. You like Ted. Wow. This is huge. Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what? No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro. Miss."
204,1,14,lily ,"Do you think they've been in there the whole time? I don't know whether to be proud or concerned. Wow, your room must smell like a monkey cage! What? Burn! No, no, we can't, it's our nine-year anniversary. Thanks. We're going to the Berkshires for the maple syrup harvest. Hell, yeah. Nothing better than a weekend at a good bed and breakfast. Complimenting the odors and their collection of needle-point geese. Yeah, well, we'd better get going, it's like a four-hour drive. Or we could just stay home. Order in some Chinese. Hell, yeah. I'm so glad we decided to just stay home. And yet we'd feel obligated to have s*x. Oh, my God, what are they doing home? But we didn't go away, we're in the bathroom. But I don't want to hide out in here. Okay, fine. I guess I'll actually floss. Ugh, that is bad. That is, like, high-school-literary-magazine bad. It's actually working. Yeah, try five. No way! We can't go out there now. They'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time. It'll be too weird. Honey, could you hold my hair back, I think I'm going to hurl. I don't know, we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us. No, I'm serious, Marshall. I mean, we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip. And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom. Yeah, but we could still have some more romance. Now, you just say, ""Want to do it?"" And I say, ""Yeah."" No! Maybe we're just out of firsts. Yes! Yes! No! Do her! Do her now! I need a drink. Do we have any cough syrup in here? Marshall, what happened to us? We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long. Have we lost that? Okay, well, get ready for my sex-ray vision. Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning? Oh, damn it. Let's just hold hands. This is nice. All right, we totally suck at this. We really, really need to get out of here. Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you, it'll change the entire nature of our relationship. I have to pee. Yeah. Look at us. We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet. The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it, it might go out forever. I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon. Oh, my God, I hate Ted. I hate him so much. No, but we haven't, because I want to keep some of the mystery alive. Yes, but I always cover it with a cough. Baby, I can't hold it in any longer. It's time. I love you, Marshall. I'm okay. You okay? I'm happy for my bladder, yet sad for us. Yeah. I guess our relationship had to take a hit so a new one out there could blossom. Oh, crap! Well, I guess we can come out now. I don't believe it. They're gone. Not making me feel better. It was, wasn't it? We still have firsts. Marshall, what makes you cry? Oh, just grab my boob already."
205,1,14,marshall ,"They have to come out soon, it's Monday. Maybe they're not even in there. Thank you! Two days straight?! Come on, give us a number. Lily guessed eight, but I know my boy got to double digits. What? Her idea. I can't believe she's making you wait a whole month. I would never put up with that. It's one of New York Magazine's ""Top five romantic getaways on a budget."" Who says sexual can't be sensible? Ready to go? Yeah. Waking up for breakfast at 7:00 A.M....Sharp. Awkward conversations with middle-aged couples trying to stave off divorce. And it's supposed to rain tonight. Maybe watch some TV. Oh, Sichuan Garden! Are we really bailing? Good, cause this thing's empty. Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone? We'd be just getting there now, all tired and cranky. Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it. I would like to propose a toast. To the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever. They think we went away. Oh, it is on for my boy, Ted. They don't know that. All we have to do is hide out in here until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom. Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this. If we go out there and spoil the mood, it's not going to happen. Then one of us is going to have to have s*x with Ted, and... not going to be me. And they're not even high. Yeah, smooth but slowly. God, close the deal, already. It's been, like, 45 minutes... we could have had s*x three times by now. What up! Maybe we should just go out there. Fine. But if we're stuck in here... I'm turning up the volume. Shh. Shh. He's just staring into her eyes. Yeah... now we just make fun of people like that. It's the circle of life. Well, it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria. This is their first time. Want to... Looks like they're about to have theirs. Yes! Yes! No. No, don't answer it! You're answering it? He's answering it! Shh... Maybe. But I think I just found it. Right here. Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering with just a hint of crazy eyes. It's all right. We can do this. You love that move. It's a classic Marshall. Well, we can't. What is it? This is bad. We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other. You always think there'll be more time. How much longer do you think you can hold it? Oh, boy. Baby, why don't you just go? Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other. Well, you have farted in front of me. You always do. They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour, but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom? I know. I love you, Lily. I feel the same. And yet, strangely different. You had to do it, sweetie... for Ted. And, hey, look, at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes. They must have heard that. Good. 'Cause I got to take a whiz. Well, we still have one frontier left. Still got the deuce. Well, it certainly was a first. Of course we do. And you know what, I actually feel closer to you now. I want to know you. Like, know your soul. This moment is fleeting because it's being chased by another moment."
206,1,14,robin ,"Good news: I don't have to cover the cat show tomorrow night. Who's up for hanging out? Wow, nine years? Your relationship's a fourth grader. Congrats. Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me. Actually, I was talking to my martini. Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident. Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror? Hey? What's taking so long? I have to go. Well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped. She really needs some support... or a stranger's tongue down her throat. That seems healthy. All right. Guess I'm in. Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right. I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks. My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention. I know... I was this close to being a huge slut. Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have s*x to get pregnant. So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar? What? Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed! Oh, I believe it... this is awesome! Thank me later. Let's keep moving. These little bastards are everywhere. Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it. But I... See you on the other side. Yeah. Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game. Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L. Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox. That's a woman. Let's just focus on your target. Yeah, I got this one. Oh, my God. I love your jeans. Oh, no. I am all about the dudes. Although pickings are pretty slim tonight. Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get. Well, jeans will only get you so far. I'm going home with him. Hey. What happened? But why? Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship? Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys. I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing? No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends. What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you. No. Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second... Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted? Really? So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me? What? I didn't say I liked Ted. Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for... You're not gonna tell him, are you? A-7. Of course."
207,1,14,ted ,"Hey, guys. I wish you could stay. Call you afterwards? Bye. Zero. Guys, we just met. And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick, so we talked about it, and we decided to take this one slow. Totally her idea! But, I don't know, I'm really into this girl, and if going slow is what it takes to make this happen, I say bring it on. I don't feel so good. t's like my testicles mixed pop rocks and soda. You've only had s*x with one girl in your whole life. Oh, I can't, I'm taking Victoria out for dinner. Really? Are you sure? Wow, that snuck up on me. The 18th can't get here fast enough. Oh. Well, um, we can just... wait until you get back. I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this. 75th and Amsterdam. I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend. No. Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting. By its very nature, it... slips through our fingers... making it that much more precious. Should we take this to the bedroom? Sure. Good luck with that. (He hangs up) Sorry about that. I'll get another bottle. Should we move to the bedroom? Sure. Good luck with that. Come on, guys, get a room."
208,1,14,victoria ,"Good morning. I'm just going to ignore that. I know, me, too. But I have to go to work, and you have that meeting. I'll inappropriately text you during. Bye. So... one more week and it'll be a month. Oh, come on. Wait, the 18th? Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this... I'm going to be out of town on the 18th! Yeah. Or we could do it tonight. I'm so glad your roommates are out of town. I think this may be a perfect moment. I wish we could hold onto it forever. I want to know you. Like, know your soul. Ted, what makes you cry? Yes. You can answer it. We have all night. How about a little more wine? Ted, I can't wait any longer. There's no time for that."
209,1,14,woman ,Okay. Is this a lesbian bar? Because that girl with the blue shirt just... Really? 'Cause he's totally vibing me right now. Must be the jeans. We'll see about that.
210,1,14,,"Ted from 2030: When you meet someone special, suddenly life is full of firsts. The first kiss. The first night together. The first weekend together. For me, all those firsts happened within 48 hours of meeting Victoria."
211,1,15,all ,No Come on. Stay!
212,1,15,barney ,"Well, well, well. How rich. You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend, yet, you have been lying to her since day one. Excuse me.Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on. So, nothing for him to stand on? Okay, and thanks so much. Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin? I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return. So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy? Shannon?! Shannon, Shannon... No, don't remember any Shannon. Where's the tape? Cool, okay. You know, whenever. Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach. Oh, wow, look at that. Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me. Too bad you'll never find out. What?! Give it to me, give it, give me... Ted! Fine, fine. You cannot play it. Shannon! I love you! I love you so much. What about us changing the world together? Don't tell me you've forgotten. I know I haven't. Will I ever see another rainbow? Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe? Baby, please Don't go There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love There's a thief in the palace and she's... Hey, guys, what up? I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it. It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me. Oh, really? Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall? Show me how good it is. Okay. I'll tell you my story. Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today. It was 1998. I was just out of college, and I was working at a coffeehouse with my girlfriend. My girlfriend... *Shannon. Yeah, you were meant for me And I was meant for you. Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.* Thank you. All right. And I love you, Shannon. I know. Only five short weeks till we're down in Nicaragua. Mellow order, bro, mellow order. Sorry, I only give high twos. Listen to you. That? You know, women aren't objects. They're human beings. And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we're married. You can read about it in my zine. I feel sorry for you, man. Suits. Five weeks later, we were all set to leave for the Peace Corps. Only problem was... she never showed up. You know what? This was a mistake. Not the slipping-in-horse-poop story! Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy. My saga... continues. I went back to the coffeehouse to find Shannon. Sugar Bear, where were you? But the Nicaraguans need us! Shannon, there is no... As I walked away, I realized Shannon was an adult. Her father couldn't control her life. I had to go back and confront him. She was in the middle of a heated argument with her dad. I don't know, guys. Right. So where was I? Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad. How can... With your dad? I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross! We're breaking up? But what about the Peace Corps? But I love you. I didn't go. That night, I recorded my video and mailed it to Shannon. I didn't see her until a week later. There's sugar in the basket. Shannon! Shannon, you came back! Oh. Did you... did you get my tape? You? It was you? The story's not over. I did see Shannon one more time. I don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it. Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear. Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth. Why can't you? Yes! Do it! Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story. But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine. We fast-forward eight years into the future. Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight. Hi. Hi, Shannon. Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life. She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker: Shannon's a mom. She has a little kid named Max. That's crazy. That could have been my kid. But instead, what do I have? My whole life's some money in the bank, some suits in my closet and a string of one-night stands. My life rocks! Money, suits and s*x. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her. Yeah. Yeah. Video's pretty good on this phone, huh? Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down. Ladies, gentlemen... Ted. This has been a wonderful evening. I got great dirt on all you guys. I got Ted to tell the re-return. I finally nailed Shannon! Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right. And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is. Peace out, hombres!"
213,1,15,lily ,"I'm so excited Victoria's coming. Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return? Us? What would we do? Fine. I should go help Robin. Hey. So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight? You must really hate the bitch. Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd, and the host said she knew you. What is her name? Sharon? Shannon? Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give... Fine. I'll go get it. Barney, what was on that tape? Oh, damn it! If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse. Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did. Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead. So, should we pop it in? Yeah, so sorry. But seriously, what was up with the tape? No, no, stay. The kids still call him Funny Butt. Wait... What if somebody else told their most humiliating story? You brought the game to the bar? Oh my God! Okay, okay. Marshall's mom sent us cookies... For the team, Marshall, for the team. Hey, Mrs. Eriksen, it's Lily. Thank you so much for the delicious cookies. Mayonnaise. Really? Never would have guessed. Well, I will definitely give Marshall a kiss for you. Okay. Take care. Yeah. I wish we had a dog, so they wouldn't go to waste. I'm thinking floor s*x. Ooh, floor's cold. Grab that afghan your mom made. The... whole... time. Oh, you poor thing. You've got to tell us. You ralphed and ran? Hey. Come on. I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another, it doesn't make your life any worse. Nope. Nope. Sorry. Don't buy it. You're making it up. You're just trying to cover the fact that you actually had a profound moment of doubt about yourself and... Oh, my God. Ew, gross. Just stop it."
214,1,15,man ,"Hey, nonfat latte to go. Dude, that your g-friend? All right, high five! Whatevs. As long as you're nailing that. Hey, haircut, right here. Open up your knowledge basket, 'cause here it comes. Forget that touchy-feely crap. You get money, you get laid. End of discussion. Peace out, hombre. Oh, she got the tape. Will I ever see another rainbow Oh, man."
215,1,15,marshall ,"I know. It's just fun to say. It's called ""Marsh-gammon."" It combines all the best features of all the best games... Candy Land, I Never, Pictionary. No. Backgammon sucks. I took the only good part of backgammon, the ""gammon,"" and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs. Fine. But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest, then you ""Marshall out,"" and all your chips go into the pot, and remember, if you ever ask the question ""What?"", then... you got to drink. Got it? Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just start, you guys'll pick it up. Newbie goes first. Roll. Three! You got Autobiography. Now, that's where you have to answer a personal question about your dating life truthfully in order to move on. Hey, she's the one who rolled a three. Victoria, ""Have you ever cheated while in a relationship?"" Wow, good question. Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer. You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains. You said what, you got to drink! Okay, Robin, your roll. Five! Another Autobiography... for the player to your left, which... Victoria! Victoria, ""How many boyfriends did you have before you started dating Ted?"" Thank you! Finally somebody understands Marsh-gammon. Drink! Did you try his cell phone? Well, we all have embarrassing stories. Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it. All right. I was stopping by Lily's kindergarten class to say hi, but they were all at recess. I really had to pee, so I went into the class's restroom. It was a-a smaller target than I'm used to, so I figured I should sit down. What I didn't realize was, it was a shared bathroom. I wish I'd pulled up my pants. Oh, I know just how to decide who. Well, we're not quitting just 'cause Ted's so far ahead. Yeah, Victoria, way to step up! That is the greatest story ever! Now we all got to drink. Lily, no! Oh, crap. My mom sent cookies? So we've got the whole place to ourselves. Sounds reasonable. Barney, that was really embarrassing for both of us. We just earned a huge chunk of story. Sorry. I thought you were vomit-free since '93. So that was a lie? Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year. I think Barney just won game night."
216,1,15,ranjit ,To one hell of a night! To the cab.
217,1,15,robin ,"Backgammon, obviously. I'm going to go get another round. Hey. Oh, sure. She's great. Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted? No. Victoria's great. She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great. I said, ""She's great"" too many times, didn't I? Prude alert. Oh, slut alert! Barney, where have you been? She never showed? Fine. I'll go next. I was doing a report on live TV about a hansom cab driver. The whole time? When? Hello? Is someone out there? You re-returned for me. That's really sweet. Though you kind of ruined my customized Scherbotsky doormat. It's okay."
218,1,15,shannon ,"I love your singing, Barney. Joining the Peace Corps with you is gonna be legendary. Barney. Oh, I'm sorry. My dad won't let me go. It's just, he's still supporting me, and... Look, he's coming by soon to talk about it, but I think you should go on without me. Barney, it's your dream. It's only two years. I know we can make it. Barney, that's not my dad. His name's Greg. I've been seeing him for a few weeks. I was hoping you'd just leave, and we could avoid all this. Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase. Greg's older. He's successful. He buys me all this cool stuff. But he has a boat. You should go to the Peace Corps and forget about me. I'm just picking up my last paycheck. Barney? What are you doing here? Oh, Barney! Is your phone on?"
219,1,15,ted ,"You don't have to shout out ""poker"" when you win. Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight. Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot, so don't say anything embarrass... Don't say anything. And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin, so we you could just avoid the... No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that. Nothing. It's nothing. And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria? Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have and, in fact, moved here to get away from. However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight? Thank you. Marshall, come on. You don't have to answer that. Of course. Wait, the card actually says ""Ted?"" Play the tape, play it, play it! Yeah, I left two messages. I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard. He's off the grid. Yeah, we're-we're really sorry about that. So, what happened next? I was winning? Yeah, we all know that one. Wow, wow! Oh, my God. What happened next? Fine. Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails... You're right. Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet, but a while back, I was kind of into Robin. In fact, on our first date, I might have said, ""I love you."" Understandably, she freaked out and I left. But unfortunately, the night did not end there. We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit. And I drank... a lot. So you guys think I should have kissed her? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now. Sorry. Victoria, I know this must be..."
220,1,15,victoria ,"Okay. It's okay. Um, well, I was in a really crappy relationship in college, and I wound up kissing this guy at a party one night, and I felt terrible about it, so, I came clean, and we broke up. What? Okay, uh, well, boyfriends--I guess I've only had... two. Well... that's serious boyfriends. I've dated other guys in between. Okay, how about this? I will tell you my most humiliating story. Okay, it involves a game of truth or dare, a squeeze-bottle of marshmallow ice cream topping, and the hot tub at my grandparents' retirement community. Yeah. It kind of is."
221,1,15,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, something you might not know about your Uncle Marshall is that he's always been good at games. I mean, unbeatable. Gin! Yahtzee! Poker! Ted from 2030: We all finally agreed Marshall should be running our game nights instead of playing in them. Which he took to mean, ""invent your own game."" Ted from 2030: Kids, I tell you a lot of inappropriate stories, but there's no way in hell I'm telling you this one. Don't worry, though, it wasn't that great. Ted from 2030: We spend so much effort trying to keep parts of our lives hidden even from our closest friends. But those rare times when we do open up, it's amazing how minor those secrets all end up seeming. Of course, not every secret was told that night. But that's getting ahead of the story."
222,1,16,barney ,"Um, are you coloring in your butt? So wear another one. Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door. Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor. Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks ""suit."" Tomorrow, noon, my tailor. Noon. See you then. Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process. Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work. Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney. Are you sure? Oh, excellent. We'll take this one. Here. Play with this pin cushion. Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot. Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year. Look at us: two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash. So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp? Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill. Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company. I most certainly did... 9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes. Don't worry, I know a guy."
223,1,16,lily ,"Robin! Really? That'd be great. Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them? Sold. Victoria, what's wrong? Everything's so fluffy and white. It's like shopping in a marshmallow. How's Barney's tailor? Well, good luck, baby. Oh, good luck, baby. Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess. Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make. Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs! Ugh. All talking and no s*x. k*ll me now. It's okay, guys, I hate it. You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him. Maybe he's going to buy you one. Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars. Are you okay? Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country. Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket. Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night. Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description. Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty. Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever? Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married. (She sits on the cake, without noticing it) Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right? It was like this when I found it? Credit card... s. No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison. Yeah, but only, like, second base. I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress."
224,1,16,marshall ,"I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt. I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday. Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world. A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding. No thanks, dude. (Barney grabs Marshall's pants and tears them apart) Noon? Hey, baby, how's the dress place? Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind. Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store? You speak Ukrainian? No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no s*x. k*ll me now. Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris? Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, ""You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face."" Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am. Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost k*lled us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay. Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling. Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose? God. I'm going to look hot. No way. The Kid does not sell out. No. I've made my decision. Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind. Bye. God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry. Well, thank you for acknowledging it. It was weird that you hadn't. Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today? Yeah, but she's still in town. Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together. Ted, think about it this way: if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow, would you sit on the couch and cry about it, or would you run, and jump, and do some awesome air kicks while you still could? New pajama bottoms? Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own. Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp. B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price. You set this up! You set this whole thing up! Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise. What time is the interview?"
225,1,16,robin ,"Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. We're just at that place in our strong friendship. Get off me. Oh, see? I did it again. Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster? The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes. I saw a couple up front that were nice. And cake. Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship? Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months. Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean. s*x. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This b*st*rd's kicked. It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses. A cat person. Why am I not surprised? Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying. Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany. Ugly, ugly, ugly. I'm fine. I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship. I know what you mean. Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together. Oh, no way... you're the coolest. Okay, I am. Wow, you look incredible. Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity. Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake. Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is. Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune. Well, here's hoping he cheats on you."
226,1,16,robin and lily, Hey.
227,1,16,ted ,"My first solo batch. Wait. Germany, Europe? So, this is the Europe Germany? The one in Epcot? Sorry. Congratulations. Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us? Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college. Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel... Monday, September the...? Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want. We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it. Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option. Really? You? Yeah. Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point? Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be. Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people. All right. (He calls Victoria) Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats? Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye. (He hungs up) She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all. So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go. I want you to stay. Hey, random question: how do you feel cats? I want you to stay. You're going? So that's what you decided? What is this, opposite day or something? So it is? I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are. Well, that's just crazy. But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there. We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this. I guess so. I guess so. It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome. She's leaving tomorrow. Yeah, she... she's still in town. Awesome air kicks, huh? You know it. So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off. No, the leg is a metaphor. Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight? Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to. Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try? Yeah, big day. Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the s*x. I'm going to miss you, too. Even if we're not. Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance? We can beat the odds. It's gonna work. We're going to make it work-- it'll work."
228,1,16,victoria ,"Um, I think those need to stay in the oven a while longer. Here's a professional tip. If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake. It's a beverage. Hey, girls. Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted. It's our two monthiversary, so we're going out to dinner. Really? Oh. What are you guys up to? Oh, dress shopping. You know, I make wedding cakes for a lot of fancy bridal shops. If you want, I could take you shopping, maybe get you a discount. Yeah. Huh. I should take this. Hello. I've just been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany. It's for two years. I figured I didn't have much of a chance, 'cause they don't let many Americans in, but... I'm in. What other Germany would it be? Ted. Thank you. I don't know if I'm going to go. I don't know. I just... I don't think that long distance really works for anyone. So, that leaves us with... I have to leave on Monday. Ted. Do you have any thoughts? It's a date. Hello. Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal. All right, I've been thinking a lot about this... Okay, wait, before you say anything, I wanted to give you this. This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking. Oh, these women are experts. They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear. At least we get free champagne! Mm-hmm. You know, I don't know. I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted. I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works. I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One. That's pretty hard to walk away from. But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted. He's amazing. He's the best guy I know. I really don't... Just horrible. But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates? It's too soon. Ooh. Speak of the devil. Hello. Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal. Bye. Why does Ted want to know if I like cats? I did hear barking in the background. Maybe he was in a pet store. Does he want us to get a cat together? That is low. Do you really think that's what he's doing? I don't know what to say. You know what? We're doing this all wrong. I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun. Somebody say ""beautiful princess."" Oh, look how happy she is. You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women who would never let any guy mess with my career. And now I'm actually thinking about it. I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something. You do? See, that's what I'm afraid of. Robin... I think that you are the coolest. I'm so glad that we're friends. No, you are. I'm going to stay. But, you know what? It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry. I wanted to give you... this. This is what happens when you... you know, let them finish baking. I have to go to Germany. Yes. I have to. Well, no... I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying, but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go. No. Ted, we've only been dating for two months. I can't let you make this decision for me. Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me? Oh, okay. So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy. You'd have me. So... we're breaking up? Wait, so we're sharing the leg? How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day, and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next? I don't know, Ted. Well, what would you want to do? Like go to the Mets. See some monkeys at the zoo? Wow! We better get going. Yeah. I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks. I'm going to miss you so much. Hey, you know, I mean, if, when I get back, we're still single, we can... Okay. Yes. Yes! Odds, schmodds."
229,1,16,victoria and robin, Oh!  Aw.  Aw.
230,1,16,woman ,"Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear? Thanks. And how will you be paying for this?"
231,1,16,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when it comes to love, the best relationships are the ones that just come naturally. Ted from 2030: Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun, and easy, and uncomplicated. It was pretty great. Ted from 2030: And that's when things got complicated. Ted from 2030: And so I met her that night to tell her my decision. Ted from 2030: And, kids, that's exactly what we did with our last day. The museum, the bridge, the restaurant, and all of those nice things. Ted from 2030: It didn't work. Long-distance was and is a terrible idea, a really terrible idea, just awful. But more on that later."
232,1,17,barney ,"Go for Barney. A sasquatch? Yes! Look at you. You suited in an unmistakably upward direction. Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all: Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness... Yeah, I had it made. Sit. Please. Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall. These guys are in legal. You're gonna be working with them. Marshall? Sidebar. Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up. What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great. Please. Oh, of course it's not for you. It's for Lily. Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package? The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while. Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver. Okay. But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier. Marshall, consider the penguins. On the wall. Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy. And you know why? Because you're different. Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are, or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier. Okay, I'm psyched about this. But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too. Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it. Show it. What was that? Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure. That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt! And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done. Whatever. There's always a guy. You sure? You want to practice your story one more time? Nah. I'm so over karaoke. Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really. But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard."
233,1,17,bilson ,"Nice tie. Steak sauce. Okay, Eriksen, let's get to work. It's 2:00 a.m. It's raining outside. Ding dong! What? The doorbell? Oh, hello, Jessica Alba in a trench coat and nothing else. But wait-- knock, knock. Somebody's at the back door? Oh, my gosh, Jessica Simpson? What a surprise. Two Jessicas, you gotta pick one. What do you do? Go. Fiancee's out of town. What do you do? Go. Okay, fiancee's dead. Hit by a bus. What do you do? Go. What do you got there, Ericksen? Mommy pack your lunch? ""Dear Marshmallow. Good luck today. I love you. Lilypad."" P.S. If you've unfolded this note, your kiss already got out. Quick-- catch it."" And all four are totally naked. You gotta choose one. What do you do? Go. Ahh! Wrong! Betty White. Clean this stuff up, Eriksen. Great story. Dude, Scarlett Johannsen with no arms, any day of the week. Yeah. What? No way. You got to go with some Black Sabbath. Steak sauce, dude. That's my man!"
234,1,17,blauman ,"Oh, steak sauce! For true, though. Oh... Does she cut the crusts off your sandwich, too? What's that? Eriksen...that was steak sauce! But wait, knock-knock, back door, who's there? Angelina Jolie... wait, in a wheelchair. What do you do? Go. Steak sauce. Should we tell him? All right, Eriksen, I've got some good news. On Monday, Bilson and I are going to talk to Montague in HR. When you graduate, we want you working with us. What do you say? Yes! I told you he would. Aw, we're gonna own the office."
235,1,17,lily ,"Here's your sack lunch. I love you, Marshmallow. And how many have you sent her? Hey! How was your first day? What? What makes them jerks? Oh, screw those guys! We're adorable. Sweetie... It would be cool to have some extra money, but, but, if you're unhappy, it's not worth it. Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational. It sounds kinda like peer pressure. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure. We have an assembly every year. All right, but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke, what do you say? Good boy. Okay...what do you think? Steak sauce? Look, you know, whatever anthropology you do at work is your business, but please don't act like that around here. No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline came home from the gorillas, she didn't run around picking nits out of people's hair and-and throwing feces. I'm begging you just, just leave it at the office. Because you're acting like one of those guys, and those guys are lame. Okay. You're right. They're delightful. Oh, baby, they have our song. Let's do ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart."" Well, actually, Marshall and I have this little dance routine. Okay, that was gross. When were you going to tell me you changed your entire career path? The package?! You've already given me the package. You've got a great package, Marshall. I love your package. Your package has always been big enough. You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen, but you've got a huge package. *I couldn't if I tried* *Baby, you're not that kind...*"
236,1,17,marshall ,"What advice do you have for a budding anthropologist? Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live with the gorillas, just like you did. I'm saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible... Okay, one cup. The kid needs to be alert. First day on the job and everything. Okay, it's just an internship to make a little money. After law school, I'm going to work for the NRDC. They're gonna stop global warming. Okay, I love you because, one, you made me a sack lunch and two, you laugh every time you say the word ""sack"". I love you. Uh-oh. Ted? Yeah. Yeah, she did. How many is that so far? God, that is so me at 15. Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters. There's one for awesomeness? Hey, so, now that I'm working here, are you finally going to tell me exactly what your job is? Marshall Eriksen. Nice to meet you. Where, I don't, I don't see... I don't have a back door. Right. Well, uh... I'm engaged, so-- We're still engaged, even if she's... I don't wanna talk about it. The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks. They're jerks! Forget it, I don't want to talk about it. Well, like today at lunch.. For your information, my fiancee did. No. Nothing. Give it. Give it. Give it back. Hey, give it. Gimme... Give it! I know. God. It's like freshman year all over again. Only this time, my sweet dance moves aren't going to be enough to win them over. Not even Old Reliable. I quit. We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do? I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me. What? The package? Lily doesn't care about that stuff. She'll be happy. I guess, uh... Bea Arthur. Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone? The penguins? ""Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold."" This is a motivational poster? Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled, but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas. I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them. It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool? No, no, no. It's totally anthropological and it's cool and I'm doing it. I'm portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure. Only when I'm drunk. Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched. I'm psyched! Wow, that was really specific. So badly. Right. Get what done? Cool. And what guy is this? Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready. All right. So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa, and they're all, ""Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs."" So I'm, like, ""Snapadoo!"" So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport......and that is when the bouncer kicked us out. Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, but dudes, fake diamond ring? Worth every penny, bruh. 'Sup, Blauman? E-bomb here. We still on for karaoke? Dope. I'm going to rock you on the mike so hard your hears are going to bleed gravy. Catch you on the flip, butt puppet. Steak sauce. Yeah. Lily, when Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-... Why? Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes, but they're actually good guys, and if you got to know them, then you would see that. Come karaoke with us tonight, and you'll see how totally not that lame they are, okay? So, Barney, you gonna sing anything? Really? I thought you'd be totally into it. ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart."" Elton John, Kiki Dee. ""Iron Man."" I could do ""Iron Man."" Nothing has changed, okay? I still want to help the environment. I just thought that maybe I could make some money for a few years. We could buy an apartment, send our kids to good schools. You could quit your job and focus on your painting. I know that you say you don't need it, but... I love you and I want to give it to you anyway. I want to give you the package. Lily, you're the most incredible woman I know, and you deserve a big package. Hey, hey. Yeah. Yeah. How you doing? Oh, God, I'm sorry, man. Preserving something that's already gone. Sounds like environmental law. *Don't go breakin' my heart* *Honey, if I get restless*"
237,1,17,robin ,"How many of those have you eaten? Oh, Teddy boy. All right, here's what you do: Put together a care package of stuff from New York-- some H&H bagels, an Empire State Building keychain... and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready? From three days ago. That is funny. Okay, fine, I have feelings for him. The irony is clear, Ted. So, did she get the awesome care package yet? Did she love it? So what's the problem? Oh, Teddy boy. It's pretty clear. Totally what I was thinking. Get out of my head, man! I cut off all my fingers? Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it. I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident. I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you. I'd wait. Hello. Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something. I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome. Hi, Ted. It's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but, uh, do you want to come over?"
238,1,17,ted ,"So you don't want coffee. All right. I'm pouring it out. I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us. ""The kid"" has become ""the man."" I love you too, Marshmallow. Oh, no. No, she didn't. Another care package? Three. In the mail or in my mind? Zero. She's up three-zip. Oh! Cupcakes! Great. I bet they're delicious, too. Yup, they're delicious. Damn it! I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes. God, I hate myself right now. Sure you don't want one? Four. Teen. No, just four. And the icing from two more. So, anyway, here's the problem. Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep. Anyway, I got the care package, and it's just great. Here, listen... Mmm. Mmm! So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake... And... I said something dumb. Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail. I sent it a couple days ago. And it's awesome. Really, really awesome. Why did I say that? I think frosting makes me lie. Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her. So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake. That's brilliant. You're brilliant. You know, it's funny, not so long ago, I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you. Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like. Yep. Yesterday. Ooh, she loved it. So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you, we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half. Eventually you just run out of stuff to say. What did you have for lunch today? Oh. Rye bread. Yeah. I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch. Maybe it just can't be do. I think it's clear what I have to do. I have to go to Germany and surprise her. Uh-oh. So she's going to dump me. Has anyone ever said, ""Listen, I've been thinking,"" and then follow it up with something good? It's not like: Listen, I've been thinking, Nutter-Butters are an underrated cookie. What else can it be? What could she possibly have to say to me that she couldn't write in an e-mail? Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy. So I should still buy that plane ticket, right? Why hasn't she called yet? No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership. Thanks. Anyway, it's almost 11:00. I should let you go. Break a leg. I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring. Marshall. Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you in a month. I think Victoria's about to break up with me. Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like. The more I try to picture her, the more I can't. Like, I remember how she makes me feel. I just... I don't completely remember her. It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone. I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car? Hello."
239,1,17,victoria's voice," ""Hey, Ted, sorry I missed your call last night. This long-distance thing sucks, huh? Listen, I've been thinking and I really need to talk to you tonight. I'll call you at 11:00. Victoria."" So?"
240,1,17,voice ,"Mr. Stinson, this is Willis from lobby security. Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports of a sasquatch loose in the building. That's right, sir, a Bigfoot. We don't want to alarm you, but he's been spotted on your floor."
241,1,17,,"Ted from 2030: When your Uncle Marshall was ten years old, he read a book called Life Among the Gorillas. It was written by an anthropologist named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez, it told the story of the year she spent living among the Western Lowland Gorillas of Cameroon. When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez came to the local community college to give a lecture, Marshall, the youngest member of the audience, raised his hand with a question. Dr. Birnholz: So you want to be an anthropologist? Ted from 2030: What she said next changed his life. Dr. Birnholz: Oh, that's wonderful, but I'm afraid you can't. They'll all be dead by then... Marshall:...and if economic sanctions and trade restrictions aren't enforced, the destruction of the rainforests will continue and over a million species will be wiped out. Ted from 2030: Well... I mean... they did their best. Ted from 2030: Another care package. I'd been in a long-distance relationship with Victoria for nearly a month. Long-distance relationships are a bad idea. Ted from 2030: Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel. Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls. I mean, this was a huge company, so they did other things... But mostly they wanted the public to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff. Anyway, Marshall managed to score an internship in their legal department because he knew someone who worked there. Man #1: My dawg! Man #2: My dawg! Ted from 2030: And here's why it was funny. Ted from 2030: Little did I realize, a few weeks earlier, here's what Robin was saying to Lily about me. Ted from 2030: And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla, and that meant gorilla lessons. Ted from 2030: The next moning, I was about to buy my ticket to Germany when I got an e-mail. Ted from 2030: And so I was sitting at home, waiting for the phone to ring, something occurred to me. Barney, singing: *He's giving you the blues. You want to graduate, but not in his bed. Here's what you got to do Pick up the phone...* Barney, singing: *Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds. Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds. Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap, ow. Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap...* Uh, rockupied. Dude, what...? Ted from 2030: It turns out some things are worth preserving. But here's the real question: It's 2:00 a.m. Your friends are still out singing karaoke, but you're home early 'cause you're expecting a call from your girlfriend in Germany, who was supposed to call four hours ago. And then the phone rings. Ted from 2030: What do you do? Go."
242,1,18,all ,No.
243,1,18,barney ,"So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks? 'Cause I just saw one. What up? Tiny five. Please. Kids, let's rap. You guys don't give half a brown Crayola what I do for a living, do you? No. I know what you want. Magic. Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted? Yeah, she told me already. Go on. Well, I guess I'm just better friends with her than you are. That is a lie! Okay, that's it! You and me! I'm not afraid of you! What? No. It's 2:30. You know, I have found, in my travels... that all the best things in life happen after 2:00 a.m. When I look back at the best stories of my life-- the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy, the almost four-way. I said ""almost."" All those things happened after 2:00 a.m. because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary. What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends? And it begins. Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis? No! No, come on. Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the ""le"". We still got the ""gen."" The ""da."" The ""ry."""
244,1,18,cab driver," What's fine?  Nice.  You ain't kidding, kid. Want a nip?  Where you going to, buddy?  Thanks."

247,1,18,lily ,"You have feelings for Ted. Marshall was here yesterday. They just learned the word ""fiancé."" Okay, let's have a big hand for Robin the reporter. All right, our next guest is another friend... He has a job doing... What do you do? Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me. It's a big secret, so don't tell her I told you, but she's very vulnerable right now and you have a girlfriend. Go home, Ted. Yes. So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there. Go home, Ted. Go home, Ted. Good. He's going home. What do you mean? No, he's not going up there. He has more sense than that. Okay, it's time for bed. Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m. We're going home. Gonna? Okay, but, but, as of right now at-at... 2:45 a.m. you still have a girlfriend. Ted, I love you. I love Robin. But if you do this right now, your entire future with her will be built on a crime. Just go home, Ted. Don't do this the wrong way. It's my best and most annoying trait. I think he just spat on me. Okay, if we're at the ""le,"" then I say we follow it up with a ""t's go home."" Okay, seriously."
248,1,18,little boy, Are you a lesbian?
249,1,18,little girl, Do you have a fiancé?  Then who do you live with?  Don't you get lonely?  My grandma has five cats and she gets lonely.
250,1,18,man ,"So, Scherbotsky, got a boyfriend? Oh, I just thought that guy you were on the phone with... We should have s*x. Why not? We're both available, we're both attractive, we're both good at it. At least, I'm good at it. And even if you're not, don't worry, I'll have a good time either way. Get involved? Who said get involved? I'm just saying we should have s*x, it could be fun. Home number. Call me anytime. A lot of local teens in action tonight..."
251,1,18,marshall ,"Hey, did she call? Let me call you back. Honey, there's a situation developing. Do you remember the huge secret that you told me that you weren't supposed to but you did? The thing... about Robin? Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell? She told you and not me? Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are. It is not a lie. I'll show you things you never seen before! I used to box in the Army! Ted, I just saw the news and a truck carrying sulphuric acid overturned right in front of Robin's house. And it's melting through the sidewalk. You can see straight down into hell. It's bad. You should go home, dude. Ted, what does your mom always say? Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m. Go home! It's too late for juice. He is so not going home. I cannot believe you just told him that. Lily, here's what you just said: ""Ted, whatever you do, don't go up there. There's a beautiful girl who wants to have s*x with you. And then she's gonna make you some delicious juice."" How much does Korean Elvis rock? I'll answer that. Infinity. He rocks... infinity. You never had a four-way. Sorry about that. I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's. Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis, but what the bleep are you doing, dude? Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going. Yes! Oh, wow, you just got burned, phonics style. Hey, you guys remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards?"
252,1,18,robin ,"Maybe. ""This long-distance thing sucks, huh? And I really need to talk to you tonight."" She's not going to break up with you, Ted. Do you want to come over? Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over? Sit. Good boys. Okay, remember, stay out of the liquor cabinet. I'll see you tonight. And so the life of a television reporter is very rewarding, and I stronly urge you to consider it as a career. Thank you. Yeah? Oh, no, I don't have a fiancé. Well, actually, I've got five dogs. No, I've got five dogs. Well, yeah, that's cats. I'm not some pathetic cat lady. Not that your grandmother is... Does anyone else have a...? Yes? No. Are you? Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les... Ha-ha. Laugh now, those kids are monsters. They're going to eat you alive. Hello. Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something. I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. No, and why does this keep coming up today? What? Oh, no, that was Ted. He's just a friend. I mean, there was this moment where we almost dated, but we want completely different things. Anyway, now he has this girlfriend in Germany and he thinks she's calling to dump him tonight, but I don't think she is. And besides, we want completely different things. What? Well, moving past the horrifying image of your hair helmet clanging against the headboard, don't get involved with people I work with. Hey, guys. Miss me? I missed you, too. Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over? Ted? Do you want to come over? Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like, ""You know who likes juice? Ted."" Great. So you want to come over and make juice? Yes, we'll juice. Okay... bye. Hi. Or we could just drink wine. Thanks. Sure. Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore or what the hell you're doing with your life? Do you ever have one of those days? I don't know, it was just a, a rough day and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you. So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend? What? Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful. Am I? No I'm not. I'm a news anchor. Smiling's a part of the job. Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today. See? You're smiling, too. Oh, yeah. Do you like it? Wow. Weird. I'll be here. Hey. Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah. Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow. Good night, Ted. Oh, my God. We're making out. This is crazy. Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but... Yeah? Okay. Okay. Bye. (She hungs up) I thought it was mine, so I answered it. It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back."
253,1,18,ted ,"She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and... Do you want to try long distance? She's going to dump me! Hello? Hello. Why hasn't she called yet? What's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership. Uh, yeah... Uh, hi, I'm here. Why? What's up? I love juice. Okay, sure. I'll come over. We'll... juice. Okay. Bye. This is fine. This is totally fine. Oh, I'm, uh, going over to this girl's house to make some juice. No, it's not like that. We're juicing as friends. See, I have this girlfriend, I would never cheat on her. She lives in Germany. See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk. I still haven't heard from her. I don't know. Sorry to bug you with my problems. Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh? You can just let me out right up here. Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth. Okay, here's where I left off with the last guy. See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over to this other girl's house... Okay, relax, Robin's just a friend. Yes, yes! Juice is perfectly harmless. In fact, it's healthy. I am not won... Okay, even if I am wondering that, it's only 'cause you put it in my head. Damn it! Nothing's going to happen. Okay, okay. You want a second opinion? Fine. No. I need a ruling. Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but I'm on my way over to Robin's right now. She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out. Come on, pick up. Damn it, Victoria, where are you? Pick up, pick up! No, thanks. Where are you? Why haven't you called? Yeah. Why do I doubt that? Hello. Marshall, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen. Nothing good ever... Dude, Robin and I are just friends. She doesn't even like me that way. What? She-she likes me? She likes me? Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home. Keep the change. You want to get out of the way? You know, if you had just called me, I... Hi. Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets. Wine... not? Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said. Make it a big glass. So, how's it hanging? Uh, about once a week. We broke up. Yeah. Yeah, she finally called. We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is-- and then... she dumped me. You're smiling. Yeah. I have no idea what that's all about. So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look. Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right. Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this. Hello? Was that Korean Elvis? Um... Actually... I'm at Robin's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria. What do you expect from me? It's Robin. Victoria's great, but, it's Robin. I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria. Yes. First thing tomorrow. I hate how you're always right. Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon. I should probably get going. It's pretty late. I'm sorry. I... Can I call you tomorrow? Okay. Good night, Robin. Right. Right? Right? Yeah. Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick. Stop doing that. I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man. What do you want from me? People break up. It happens. It's not ideal. You're right. I owe you a real breakup call. I'll call you tomorrow. Why should I have to go home? You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry. It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the g*n by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Robin. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay. Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night. This isn't my phone. Was it...?"
254,1,18,victoria ,"I've just been offered a fellowhip at a culinary institute in Germany. Yes. And you're wondering if I'd be upset. Hi, Ted. Remember me, your girlfriend? Right. You're going to go make some juice. Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering what she looks like naked? Ah, but I'm just a manifestation of your subconscious, so actually, you put it in your own head. Right. Cupcake? Oh, I'm out hooking up... with three other guys. Or maybe I'm a devoted girlfriend and I'm calling you right now. So you're doing this? You're going up there? I'm not in the way. Whatcha doin'? Okay. Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be? Length of an average pee? No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes. Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive... Not like this. Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with. Good. So you're gonna go home? Ted. Oh, please. You just want to get laid. That's not your phone."
255,1,18,,"Ted from 2030: Previously on How I Met Your Mother... Ted from 2030: Kids, your grandma always used to say to me, ""Nothing good happens after 2:00 a.m.,"" and she was right. When 2:00 a.m. rolls around, just go home and go to sleep. Case in point: Ted from 2030: Let's back up a little bit. Ted from 2030: Having s*x is fun. Ted from 2030: When it's after 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep because the decisions you make after 2:00 a.m. are the wrong decisions. Marshall & Lily: What? Ted from 2030: I did have more sense than that. Ted from 2030: But after 2:00 a.m, my good sense was sound asleep. Ted from 2030: When the clock strikes 2:00, just go to sleep. Ted from 2030: Meanwhile, back at the bar, Barney was still trying to prove that good things can happen after 2:00 a.m. Ted from 2030: And so, Barney was right-- the night was legendary. It would come to be known as The Time Lily Kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards. Ted from 2030: I called Victoria from the cab and we broke up. Yes... And there you have it, kids. The stupidest thing I've ever done. In one night, I managed to hurt two people I cared about. And none of it would've happened if I just listened to my mom. So I guess if there's a lesson to be learned here, it's this: when it's 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep."
256,1,19,all ,Yes! Word up!
257,1,19,barney ,"Trust that impulse, Ted. You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night? Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs. Count again. So get an escort. Why not? Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession. Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out. Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun. Yes. That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute. Withdrawn. Is that your water? May I? Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump. Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool. You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic? That's racism. And I do not drink with racists. Good day. I said good day! Yeah, it won't be weird. Because you're going to bring your own date. Hi, Mary. Have you met Ted? See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable. Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow. So I got you a date for the evening. Think about it, this is perfect. A: it will make Robin insanely jealous... B: you get to have s*x with her... and C: maybe by getting to know Mary, you'll come to see that courtesans are people, too. And D: ""B"" all night long. The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall. No one will suspect a thing. They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and... Okay, that's a little bit suspicious. Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight. But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever. Ted, you're my cabron. You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tr*nny from the Port Authority? Look at how hot she is. Robin would be so jealous. Oh, please. How's it's going to come out? ""Uh, pass me a towel. P.S., I have s*x for money."" Lily, quit your job. Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board, and you'll make a ton more money. She's a paralegal. Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts. Actually, don't use the mini-bar. Do it. Come on, Ted, do it. This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30. No, lose your virginity. What up. Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships. Withdrawn. So you and he aren't...? Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any. In keeping with tonight's award show motif, I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending! Vampire Lou, would you do the honors? That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done. No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean. I know, it was hilarious. I did it to prove a point. Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date. All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet and your slump is over. Come on, dude, you should be thanking me. Can you blame her? You called her a hooker. Your room?"
258,1,19,lily ,"What do you mean ""could""? A... LAME-A? What? Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm just exhausted from work. The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day. It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap. Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me? Yep. Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous. No, it's not going to be weird at all. (Lily's on the phone with Marshall) Robin's bringing a date. I know. Hey. I'm Lily. Who has s*x for money? No, not really. We just chitchatted and I borrowed her lipstick. Why is Vampire Lou the host of a Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie? You know, it just makes no sense. God, that pisses me off. Oh, yeah, I'm just tired. And when I get tired, I get cranky. ""Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky."" Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time. Well, guess what, Barney? I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make, unlike you and, sadly, my fiance. Yeah, because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck, what would that make me? Exactly. Thank you, Mary. Oh, what firm? Marshall, what is up with you and Ted? Is that true? You know, Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low, but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle. Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah! No!"
259,1,19,marshall ,"You should definitely go. Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her. You really think that's true? Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen. Kaboom! You've been lawyered. You just made that up. Lawyered. The point is, how long has it been? Boy. That's going to be really weird. Robin's bringing a date. Dude, it's going to be weird. Check out Robin's date. Is that who I think it is? Yosemite Sandy, definitely. Mary is a friend of Barney's. Barney invited her. Just met Mary ourselves. Don't know too much about Mary. Look, a beer. Man, Vampire Lou just looks great. Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together, man. Secrets come out in there. Nobody. What did you guys talk about in there? Anything interesting? Well, it's just an internship, for the record. That's a real law firm. Nice. You just made that up. Lawyered. Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up. And second of all, you cannot do this. It's wrong on every level. And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed. Yeah, well... there we go. Congratulations. Dude, what are you doing? It looks bad, is what it looks like. You cannot do this. Oh, that's real mature. Nothing, baby. Don't worry about it. Fine. Do what you want. Hey. Wow, so they're...? Robin, where's Sandy Rivers? He's off trying to make you jealous. Lily, I know you're asleep, but I have to tell someone this, and we tell each other everything. So, here it goes. Mary's not a paralegal. She's a prostitute. Barney paid for her. We were having a conversation about prostitution, and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar and now she and Ted are upstairs. That's her napkin. What? So she's not...? Not funny, dude. I'm sorry, dude, it was funny. Come on, if you don't laugh, it just seems mean."
260,1,19,mary ,"Nice to meet you Ted. So we're going to an award show? Hi. Hi. Mary. It's nice to meet you. Wow. Why are you so tired? A prostitute. Yes, I'm a paralegal. I just assist with day-to-day clerical work in a law firm downtown. Douglas, O'Halloran and Stamp. I know. Are you flirting with me? Yes, it's encouraged. Well, thank you. Hey, you know that scene in Empire where they lower the helmet onto Darth Vader's head? Do you think that's how Sandy puts his hair on in the morning? Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room. Should we go? There's not enough money in the world. Not shy about your looks, are you? Done what? Yeah, right. Wait, you're kidding, right? Well, Ted, I mean, I've been going on dates since I was 15. Yeah, that sounds great. I had clients riding me all day long. Yeah. I mean, this one guy just wouldn't leave me alone. I mean, talk about a**l. Well, here we are. What? No... Ted, I'm a paralegal. No, Ted... I'm a paralegal. No, I'm a paralegal."
261,1,19,robin ,"Hey. Something kind of cool just happened. My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award. We prefer Local Area Media Award. Um... there's going to be this big banquet. I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came. And there's an open bar. Really? It's three months away. So should I wear my hair up or down? Lily. You okay? Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were? Is that safe? Ted's still coming to this thing, right? Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date? No, it's just this guy at the station. I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes. Is it going to be weird? Hi. Oh, um, Ted, this is Sandy. So, Mary, what do you do for a living? Oh, so, Mary the paralegal. What does a paralegal do exactly? Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him. Don't let him out of your sight for a minute. Hey. Mary seems nice. Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting until you're in a serious relationship with someone else? And just like that, it's all okay. Roll credits. We're still friends. Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous? What? Thanks. Oh, wow. This is really a surprise. Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends. They're all here tonight. Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers... Barney... And that's it. Those are all my friends. Thank you. Oh, thanks. Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab? Good night. I put him in a cab. I don't date people I work with. I was just trying to make Ted jealous. Is he...? Oh, well, good for them. And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool. What?! Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately? Is he having a nervous breakdown?"
262,1,19,sandy ,"Here we have, on the front page, a story about a... I guess, a guy in a superhero costume climbing the Empire State Building. Looks interesting. Hi. Sandy Rivers. Use my full name. People get a kick out of it. Starting a bunch of office rumors? Looks that way. Looks that way. Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky. You got me. What do you do, Ted? Thanks. I never tire of hearing that. I like that guy. Hey. What were you guys talking about over there? Well, thanks. You know, this is one of the nicer hotels I've ever been in. Sure. Let's go."
263,1,19,ted ,"Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set? Disc three. My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone? Come on. Disc three! God, Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours. I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it. Yeah, put me down for two. I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time. I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know. Yes, that's what I meant by ""you know."" I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls. Look, I shouldn't go. That's only two. Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours. By ""escort,"" you mean prostitute? Because... gross? Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have s*x with? No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross? 57 days. Yeah, go ahead. No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good. Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp. You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can... Oh. Okay. That's not weird. She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on. No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird. Thank you. Hi, Mary. Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too. Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Barney. What the hell? You got me a hooker. A really hot hook-- A hooker! I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet. 500 bucks? I'm not trying to make Robin jealous, Barney. Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul. I know. Yep. It's Sandy Rivers. Sandy time. Sandy time! Which Sandy do we want today? French Sandy, p*rn star Sandy...? Excellent choice. I love this guy. I hate this guy. Hey. You look nice. Hi, Sandy. Rivers. So are you two, uh... Oh, how rude of me. Uh, Robin, Sandy... Rivers... this is Mary, my date. I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker. Lily, you okay? You're pretty good on your feet. Is that allowed? You know, I wouldn't normally say this on a first date, but... well, considering... I'm just going to say it. You are so hot! You're welcome. So, Sandy, what do you do? Oh, wait, I know what you do. You're the guy who reads the paper in the morning. Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning. But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect where I make an actual contribution to the world. I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific. You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love. Damn, you just got even hotter. Hey. I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened. So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now? Are we? You don't return my calls, we never hang out and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face? Oh, so now she's a whore? You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome. And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous, I came here to support you as a friend. And frankly, I'm sick of trying. Hey. Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome. Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel. You should see the rooms. The views are amazing. Sleep with a prostitute? I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame. She's really cool. Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs? We, uh, got a room. What's it look like? Marshall, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her. Besides, I'm trying to make Robin jealous. Yeah. Thanks. Well... Good night. So, did you and Barney ever...? Oh, thank God. I feel kind of like Richard Gere. No. You know, Mary, I've never done this before. You know, been... on a ""date."" No. Why, is that so odd? God, you were just a kid. Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and... Must be tough. Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot. I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this. You're a hooker. Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me. I'm not going to have s*x with a prostitute. Come on, Mary, there's no one else around. You're a hooker. No, you're a hooker. You're a paralegal. That was not funny. Why would you do that? What point? So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore? She slapped me and stormed off. Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room. Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card-- never checked out. By the way, you know what's super fun? Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain. Well, it's almost 3:00. Got a massage. Toodles."

Ted from 2030: Sandy Rivers was the face of Metro News One, the most low-budget cable news network ever.

You see what I did there? Took a... No sweat, we'll just sneak in. Well... Lesbian. No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate. Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep, and you've got ""statutory"" written all over your body. Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear? Lame! But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later. Horrible. You look so classy and nice. You're going to stick out like a sore thumb. Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days, with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris? They all dress like strippers. It's go ho or go home. That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up! Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing. Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers. Oh, Robin, are you tearing up? Hey, ho, hey! It's cool. Time to activate plan B. Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow? Scherbotsky? Don't worry about me. I'll get in. Oh... I'll get in. She's in the bathroom. How did you guys get in here? You just snu... Are you serious? I've been trying to get in here all night. I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume. You guys will thank me for this later, okay? Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...? And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth when you wear jeans to a strip club."

Kids, color!(Lily runs out of class, Marshall runs out pf the appartment, they join in the street) Come on, baby. I can't believe it. We got Van Smoot House. Division of labor. Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up. Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist. Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist? And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations. Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me. Crap! Band! We forgot a band! It's just gonna be silence and then people chewing. Who? John ""Bonzo"" Bonham from Led Zeppelin? Look, I... I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen. We... we don't even know if they can play our song. They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition. Well, then... I have to say no. Well... well, are they playing anywhere this weekend? What? Intense? I have a wedding to plan in nine weeks for 200 people. Even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt and consume this coffee table, I need you to roll with it, okay? We already have a caterer. A prom? Can... can we go to that? Yeah. No, they won't. 'Cause it turns out we're not in high school. Yes, we are. It's the only way. It's nine weeks till the wedding. At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything. No, Barney. Really? Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school? All right, what do you think? You're gonna make such a great dad. Well, we have to get in. I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday, 'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have... All right. I didn't know I still had this. The dress I wore to my actual prom. Aw, you look great, too, Scooter. Oh, disco! I am so happy for you. Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday. Aw. Sweet. Thank you. We got to go. See ya. Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids. Yeah. Look, when I was 17, I used to sneak into clubs all the time. It's all about confidence. Follow me. Whee-hoo! Happy prom, everybody. Going to prom-- whee-hoo! Okay, bye. Okay, look, I just need to see the band. I'm getting married in two months, and... Wow. ""Ma'am?"" Check and mate. Hi. Shall we? We're in! Oh, you're kidding me. Hi. Excuse me. I was wondering if you guys could play ""Good Feeling"" by the Violent Femmes. I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married and my fiancé wants to hire you guys as the band, but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play ""Good Feeling"" because that's our song, and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right? There's just so much to do for this wedding. My head is swirling. It's just all moving too fast. I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already. Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us. There's still so much I want to do. I want to travel, live overseas as an artist, maybe have a lesbian relationship. Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain. Please don't put that kind of pressure on me! It's too much! What? Yeah, sure, okay. So Andrew, what's your big plan? What's life going to be like after tonight? No, you won't. No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to. You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old before your time wondering ""Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?"" I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior. Yeah. But not about Marshall. About me. I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago and wondering what happened to her. I don't want to be tied down. I want to live in France and Spain and Italy and just soak up life and put it on a canvas, even if it means being a waitress in crappy cafés for five years, I don't care. I'm going to be a painter. And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know? But anyway, I'm blabbering. Way to make new friends, Lily. I'm sorry. What was your name again? Nice to meet you, Marshall. Guess we're hallmates. It works. Me, too. I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to. The travel, the bohemian art life, my big lesbian experience. I didn't do any of it. Yeah. Yeah. So field hockey, huh? Yeah, it's good. Two months."
273,1,20,man ,"Look, I'm kinda wasted right now, so I didn't understand any of that. But, uh, if you get us the sheet music, we'll play your song. Marshall."

It is on! Like the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan. You're a wonder. Wow. That was really awkward, Lil. And still. It's still really awkward right now. Shh! Shh! Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out. Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad. Shh! Shh! Baby, don't worry about it. I called The 88! The 88. They're this awesome band. They played my law review party. They were found guilty. On three counts of rocking. Baby, The 88 don't audition. They're, like, the Wiggles of wedding bands. Baby, they're only holding the date until Monday. Let me check their Website. It looks like The 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow. Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch. Why not? We're not sneaking in to a high school prom. Sounds awesome. We should go out and just get freakin' weird. 'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw. They grow up into skanks so fast, don't they, Ted? Yeah. Just one thing we got to do first. Yeah. And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff 200 wedding invitations. I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is. Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it. First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize. You know it. That's cool. Okay, Ted. (His phone starts rigging) Hello. Hang on. It's Robin. She wants me to go to prom. Can Ted come? Okay, bye. She totally wants you to come. What's it to you, giant turtle? Oh, hey. Where's Lily? Wait here, I should go talk to the band. Hey, bro, have you seen my fiancée Lily? Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom and the adrenaline's pumping, but... Whoa, whoa. Look, let's not get carried away. Yeah. Violent Femmes. I love this song. I totally could have taken that kid. Well, I don't need it, but thanks. No, the kid was totally, like, a white belt and I'm gigantic. Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need to get in there for one more song. So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song. Band? Check. Two months, baby. Two months."
275,1,20,robin ,"What? How are you going to get everything done? It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back. I'll go with you. Yeah. I never got to go to my prom. We always had field hockey nationals in the spring. The cough is supposed to cover the ""lesbian."" I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in. We don't want to mess things up for Lily. Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay? Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it. I never thought this would be a bad thing, but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough. What? No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore... No. I've never been to prom before, okay? Is this gonna work? Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom? For free. Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily. Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in? Yeah, what the hell? It's prom. That tastes like cough syrup. Nerds who aren't good at math? Life's going to be rough, boys. My phlegm feels looser. Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music for ""Good Feeling"" and bring it out here, like, now. Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us. He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me. I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive. Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's, it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes. All right, sheet music's on the way. Are you okay? Well, we did promise them one dance. Oh, Sean, look, um, you're a nice guy, but I just don't... No, you're not getting lucky tonight. I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me. I'm going to ask you something and, um, maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever. But, um, are you having second thoughts? Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world. I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined? And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint. And as far as your lesbian experience... Happy? Shut up. You tell me. I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me, there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl. Okay, I've missed you. Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way, not even in an I-forgive-you way. Just in a I've-missed-you way."
276,1,20,scooter ,"Dude, you are the hottest girl at this prom, and not like in a corporate, plastic way. Like, truly, truly hot. Like a hot soul. So big news. I heard from umpire school. I'm in! You mean happy for us, right, babe? No, baby. We're gonna be an umpire someday. How is it moving too fast? We've been together for two years. What's decided? I go to umpire school, you go to college. We move into my dad's house in Staten Island. We have kids, we grow old together. What's decided? It's wide open! You're, you're breaking up with me? I can't believe this. I can change. I can look more like Kurt Cobain. Please, just don't leave me. I'm nothing without you, baby."
277,1,20,security guard," Uh, you're adults.  And you're just finding a band?  I'm sorry, ma'am. You either need to be a student or the date of a student."
278,1,20,security guards, Absolutely not.
279,1,20,singer ,Thank you. We're going to take a break. This one goes out to that redhead girl and that tall guy.
280,1,20,ted ,"Wow! You guys are getting married in two months. Was it...? I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding, they were great. Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer from Led Zeppelin, who died in 1980, got married two months ago. Lily, you're being a wee bit intense about this band thing. Wow. You're getting on board with Barney's idea? Man, you really have snapped. Hey, why don't we all go? Yeah, you're right. Besides, Marshall and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding. Why don't we just make it tomorrow night? Yeah. Bye, have fun. See you. So, what, we ready for tonight? Shot of Jim Beam? Yes! What?! Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break. Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad, but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad. Do I look like I'm four? All right, what kind of prize are we talking? This is pathetic. It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights. If I got in a fight, would you have my back? I'd have your back, too. What, you don't think you'd need my help? You don't know what I can do. I'm like... like a berserker. Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame! I don't even want to go anyway. What'd she say? What'd she say? Okay. All right. We just snuck in the back. But you got in. Slow and steady won the race. Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus. You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here. Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so... Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome. You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly quick. So how was your first prom? So, basically, it was a prom. I'll take what I can get."
281,1,20,todd ,"Hello, Marshall. Lily."
282,1,20,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, about eight months into Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall's engagement, there occurred a game-changing emergency. Ted from 2030: Van Smoot House was a gorgeous mansion right on the Hudson River. It had everything Marshall and Lily wanted for their wedding, but it was never available. And then, suddenly, it was. Ted from 2030: When you're planning a wedding, there's always one couple with similar taste that seems to be one step ahead of you. Todd and Valerie were that couple. Ted from 2030: Robin had been mad at me since the night I slightly exaggerated my not-having-a-girlfriend-ness. Ted from 2030: And so, Aunt Lily had the plan to crash the prom. Boy #1: Hey, uh, you ladies want something to take the edge off? Boy #1: Yeah, we couldn't get any alcohol. Um, our fake IDs say we're only 20. We didn't realize it till after we bought them. Boy #1: So, you buzzing, baby? Boy #2: It's just one dance, God! Boy #1: So, uh, what's the deal here? Am I getting lucky tonight? Security guard #1: Trespassing, assaulting a minor. This mascot costume you stole cost $5,000. Security guard #2: We can have you guys arrested, you know that? Security guard #1: Hey!"
283,1,21,all ,Give him your number. Give him your number.
284,1,21,barney ,"I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted. Ah... Happy birthday, Ted. Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y... Oh, my God. Oh! Call an ambulance! Try not to speak. Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk. I'm serious, call 911. Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try... Here, have some water. Water! Here, drink this. Shh! Shh! Oh, thank God, you're here. I think there might be some internal bleeding. Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital. You've had a terrible fall. Really? 'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven. Angel... Give him your number. What? Give him your number. What? Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me. What are you...? Come on. They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number. It works! Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun. It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys. Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good. Binoculars. Second pair on my desk. Just take a look, will ya? Okay, corner office. Top floor. Check out that guy. Name's Clark Butterfield. He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs. So guess what I did to that sandwich? Here, I took a picture. And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him. Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot. Totally. Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great. Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern. This is war, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late. Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills. I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant. Tracy, could you come in here, please? Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him. Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf. That's what I thought, too. Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield. It got me as well. Because now... you're in. Yeah, it's probably a good idea. Anything, bro. No. What are you doing in Duchess County? I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work. We're kind of swamped. Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County. Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield. You thinking about coming to work here full-time? Thanks, Tracy. Of course we are. Were you going to think of that? That would have been bad."
285,1,21,bob ,"Right. Well... actually, that's why I'm calling. We found her, sir. We found your soul mate. Well, my firm bought out the company. You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate, but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so... here I am. There she is. Your soul mate. That'll be 500 bucks. She's not engaged. She's your soul mate. Just read the file."
286,1,21,lily ,"Ah! Sweet damn, that's a hot plate. 28. Two more 'til the big one, three-oh. Still, you know, another year older. Still single. You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking? Well, what's perfect? That's not hard. I know at least... You're never going to find this girl. Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes. He's still sound asleep. I'm going shopping after work. I'll pick up some milk. What's wrong, baby? Hey, Ted, are you busy? Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot. Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero? Marshall can't know about this. Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story. Can you please hurry? Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand? No, drifter, no! But you see my point. Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date? And was she okay about pushing it back? You can never tell Marshall. Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl. About a month ago, I started getting insomnia. Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time. But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary. He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man... I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship. San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven. Of course I want to get married. I... It's not like I was ever going to do it. I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this. Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid. I love Marshall. But why am I the only one? How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy? Ted, let's go to New Haven. I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure. Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, ""Yep. That was a mistake."" So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you? Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this. Hi. Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it. No. Nope, I'm good. I don't need any milk. Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate."
287,1,21,man ,"Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby? Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir? Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions. You signed up for our services about six months ago."
288,1,21,marshall ,"You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy. Oy, gevalt. I cannot believe that she gave him her number. Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth. So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it? Awesome. So awesome. God! Best girl ever. Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up. Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday. Oh...! These pancakes are delightful. This is the high point of my day. Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms. I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do. So? Oh! Sweet Lord. Ooh! Duck! That is sick! Why would you do that? You? What? This is stupid. This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do. I get it. Thank you, Tracy. You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again? Tastes normal to me. Oh, God! Well, then why did you have me drink it?! Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that b*st*rd pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first? So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice. Is that Ted? Don't you have a big date tonight? So what are you doing in Duchess County? Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you. Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero. So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County? You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously. Which is great, and everything, but I can't imagine having this much fun over there. Maybe. Don't tell Lily, okay? No. Horrible. Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice. Oh, hey, dude. Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date. How'd it go, dude? What? Why? Why? She sounds perfect. Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake. Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence. You and Robin have tried this again and again..."
289,1,21,paramedic ,What is going on?!
290,1,21,robin ,"Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this. You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time. And here come the paramedics. Maybe she really does have a brain injury. Oh, yes, you do. Need a ride, cowboy? Hmm, too bad. I got candy. So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County? Oh, come on. Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights. Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took ""highlights"" to mean, ""I want to look like a tiger,"" hence the hat. No way. So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist? Wow, I'm 28. Hmm. I read that. More like ""Love in the Time of Don't Bothera."" We're not indoors. We're in a van. Never. What else? Barf. What else? And she's looking to get married and have kids? Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids. You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8:56. You're early. Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for. All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do. Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair. Go."
291,1,21,ted ,"Thank you. 'Kay. Oh, go on, touch it. All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what? Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time. Barney. Whoo-hoo! Wait for it. Nope. I hit the snooze button. I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect. It's not like I have a list. Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl... I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies. Any Kim from any cool band, really. Can't be too picky. Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me. I am done trying to plan the unplannable. That's the plan. Whoa, you're up early. Does Marshall know? Please don't do that. Hey, is this milk any good? God, why didn't you throw it away? Hello? Speaking. Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match. I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place? So I'm in good hands. You found me a match? No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged. All right, fine. Set it up. Lily? Um... yes. What? What? No. Can't you just call Marshall? I can't, I'm waiting... Come on, Lily. All right, stay there. I'm on my way. Yes. Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here? I won't. I swear on Luke and Leia. Did you talk to Marshall about it? That was you? Awesome! Let me guess. It's somewhere far away. You don't want to get married. Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means. I don't think you're stupid. I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out. All done. Lily, don't do this to yourself. No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake. I don't know. You said ""mistake"" a lot. Lily, don't do this. Forgive you for what? (Lily leaves with he car) Lily. Lily! Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road. I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk... Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to k*ll you. And, also, I texted you the same thing. (He calls Barney) Hey, I need a big favor. I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up. It's kind of an emergency. Apple picking. Can you just get up here? Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do. Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn! No! No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank. I'm not in Duchess County. Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go. Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers. Candy?! Nope. Sworn to secrecy. I like your hat. Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine. Oh. I gotta see this. Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat! Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me. Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check. You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying. Vans have doors-- let me see your hair. She loves lasagna. You know, I am sensing a pattern here. Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check. Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl. Really? You don't want kids? Hey, thanks for picking me up. Thanks. You're going to show me your hair? You just made my night. Hey, guys. Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk? You think you might want to... drink the milk? I didn't go. I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her. I don't want perfect. I want Robin. Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make. Hey, is this milk any good?"
292,1,21,tracy ,"Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer... Taking off for the night. Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?"
293,1,21,waitress ,"And for the birthday boy, lasagna. Careful. The plate is very hot. Is she okay?"
294,1,21,woman ,"What? What's going on? What's wrong? What's the matter? What are you talking about? No, I haven't. All right!"
295,1,21,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, life is a dark road. You never really know what's up ahead. One night you're cruising along enjoying the ride, and then all of a sudden, you're 28. Ted from 2030: Actually, my 30th birthday wasn't so bad. Well, except for the goat in my bathroom. Which is a great story. But I'll get to that later. Ted from 2030: And little did I know, at that very moment, fate... in the form of a 600 gigahertz superprocessing computer... was taking care of it. Ted from 2030: It was true. See, Marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment. But he needed money for the wedding, so he'd been interning for two months at Barney's firm... and he hated every minute of it. Ted from 2030: So I read the file. And by God, this woman was perfect. She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina, she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword, she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna, her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl. Ted from 2030: So that night I had a blind date with my perfect match. I was so excited, I got there early. But before it even started... Ted from 2030: And so, one $90 cab ride later, I was in the middle of nowhere. Ted from 2030: Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home. Ted from 2030: Here's the thing about mistakes. Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake, you gotta make it anyway. Ted from 2030: Even really really dumb mistakes."
296,1,22,barney ,"Robin again? Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together. Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you. That wasn't me. That was the universe. I see where this is going. Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work... usually. The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999. The characters: Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name... Nice try, buddy. Ted, she is going on that camping trip. Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend. What are you talking about? Ted, do you want me to slap you again? 'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time. Yeah. Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having s*x, we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up, and of course I'm not in touch with her! Did you just say a ""rain dance""? A rain dance. A dance to make it rain. No, we are not! Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me! Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship. Twice! Shh! Hey. We weren't exclusive! Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position. There's so much of your mom in you. Ted, this is funny. Still funny. Still fu... And now it's sad. Hey, Ted. Whatcha doing? Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants. These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl. This isn't gonna work! Well, then why are you doing this? Oh, come on! How about that? He did it."
297,1,22,lily ,"So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture? Universe. So, this plan you speak of? Hello. Extra key? Do I have an extra key to your apartment? Oh, right. That key. Yeah, I lost it. No, wait, uh... Maybe you should just knock. Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay? Unpause? I was never going to take it. I was never going to take it. So you're saying you would forbid me from going? Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them. I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever. Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it. Maybe not. So, are you just, like, starving? Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious! I wouldn't dare. (Marshall starts crying) Marshall, no. We're on pause. There's no crying in Pauseland! Pauseland is a magical place, with... with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers! Damn it! I think there's still one left. Unpause? Look... I know this sucks. It's just something I'm going through. I'm not asking you to understand it. I'm not asking you to be happy about it. I'm just asking you to support it. Why not? Marshall... Marshall, I love you. Pause. Pause! Thank you."
298,1,22,man ,"And, we're clear. And we're clear."
299,1,22,marshall ,"Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills. Anybody else get chills? Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash and burn before you say, ""enough""? Yeah. Dude, that was awesome, but how are you ever going to top that? Summer fellowship? Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure. She's made her choice and you can finally move on. Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said... Unpause. A painting fellowship? In California? Forbid? Who said forbid? I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months, and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day. Look for me... I'll be the guy in the awesome suit. Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted. So now we've gone from ""I was never gonna do it"" to ""I need to do this""? Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen? I never said that! You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now, what's gonna change in three months? Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all. Pause. Totally. Red Lobster? Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it. Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you. How did we get here? Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was, did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge. Dibs. Unpause. I want to, Lily, okay? I really do. But I just can't. Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not. What if you decide to go be a painter and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore, and three months becomes forever? Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen? 'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now. I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out. Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen? No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore. Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?! Why do you want me to pause?! (She throws herself on him et kisses him) That's just a great use of the pause function, baby."
300,1,22,musician ,"Uh, we're pretty hungry. When do we get our pizza? Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier, you said there'd be pizza. Sure. We're not getting any pizza."
301,1,22,penelope ,"Why the hell should I help you? We had s*x twice in your car, and then you dumped me. How is that a relationship? Barney, there is no way... Seriously, come on. Why? ""There's this girl."" You know, the traditional rain dance is a sacred prayer to nature. I don't think the Great Spirit looks too kindly on white dudes who co-opt it to get laid. This wrong guy, is he a huge jackass? Kind of like Barney? You hit on my mom! I'm in. Okay. Crouch down and bend over a little bit. I will throw you off this roof. I think so. I think so. No. I've read extensively on the subject: firsthand accounts, theoretical criticism, the anthropological... I've seen a film strip. What do you mean ""we,"" white man?"
302,1,22,robin ,"Thanks, Lou. Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend. Guess we'll have to take a rain check. Have a great night. Well, I'd give you the ""I don't date coworkers"" speech again, but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now. Damn it. Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key. Yes, I gave it to you. Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith. Knock? Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained. Just knock. Okay. Hi. Yes. No. I don't know. Ted, this is so... I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and... I have to pee. Okay. Let's talk. Thanks, guys. Just need a minute. Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though. Kind of an inside joke. Thanks. (The musicians leave) You're crazy. It's not that I haven't thought about this. You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay? We only just started being friends again. And we want different things. That's still there. That's not going away. I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out and I'd lose you as a friend? I gotta think about this. I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping. Well, it's back on. Since like an hour ago. You're leaving? Oh, congratulations. What do you mean? Wow. Thanks. And, yes. Yes, let's go get dinner. Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip. I don't-I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. No, Ted, I don't. And you know what? That's okay. I don't plan out every second of my life like you do. Oh, really? What is all of this? I mean, why can't you just say, ""Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?"" No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates and let's spend the rest of our lives together. I need to think about this. No, I'm sorry, I... I can't do this anymore. I need an answer. Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no. And she's been throwing up ever since. Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about? Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment with a string quartet and roses and chocolates... Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy? I mean, a string quartet in my living room... who does that? Exactly. My camping trip got rained out. It's not your fault. It's pouring. You come up. Why? I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up. I was gonna..."
303,1,22,sandy ,"Yeah, but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck. And we'll check in with you tomorrow, New York. Bummer. I was hoping to finally have s*x with you this weekend, Scherbotsky. Shame, though. It was a pretty hot show tonight. The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end really got my freak juice flowing. Thanks, Lou, but that blue sky isn't without at least one cloud. I'm sorry to announce that one week from today I will be leaving Metro News One. It has been an honor to bring you the news each night, and read the paper to you each morning. I will always treasure it. Good night, New York. There. I quit my job. We're not coworkers. Will you please have dinner with me? I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN. Congratulations yourself. Well, Joel asked me who I thought should replace me as lead anchor. I told him you. They're announcing it next week. Act surprised. Yes, what? How about this weekend on the camping trip? I roast a mean weenie."
304,1,22,ted ,"So... what do you think? But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life? Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Robin, so... I gotta do this. (Barney slaps him) Ow! What the hell? One more. One more time. One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture. And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it. If it's yes, great. If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever. I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment. Remember the first night Robin and I went out? I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked. She should be here any second. Enough with the... we'll go get pizza later, all right? Just... Hi. Robin... I've sort of said this already. I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly. So this is me, just saying it. With strings. I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together. What do you say? What do you say? Those are the three options. I know. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait. No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards. Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here. Okay. Oh, hey, you guys want to take five? Right. Come on. I know. But... come on... Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane. Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious. I'm kidding. I'm serious. I thought that thing was canceled. Since when? Oh, you're kidding me. No way. Don't go on this thing. Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date. With Sandy... and his weenie. I mean is this not a date? So, what? You actually like this guy now? Are you gonna hook up with him? Yes, you do. I don't plan out every... Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point? God, you are so terrified of anything real. It's like you're floating out in space. Touch the ground, Robin. Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake. Fine. If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that. Then I guess it's not meant to be. Screw that. This ain't over. I don't care what I said. This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be. It is meant to be, and you know why? 'Cause I mean it to be. Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is. I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain! Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture? Are you still in touch with her? Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance. Yes. Yes. Yes. (Barney slaps him once again and Ted slaps him back. Barney tries again to slaps Ted but he stops him) We're finding Penelope! Yes, we are! Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend. There's this girl... Penelope, this is the girl I love. If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy. Please. Absolutely. Kind of. Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right? Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance? Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed? No? Have you ever seen a rain dance? Terrific. Uh, look, I should run. I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R. I can't believe this. We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves. A rain dance. Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour. Yeah. I know that. Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work. But it has to work! You hear me, universe? This is Ted Mosby talking! Give me some rain! Come on! Come on! Come on...! Robin! Hey, Robin! (Robin opens up her window) Oh, thank God you're here! I know. I'm sorry. Yeah, it is. Come down here. No, you have to come down here. Why? Because I made it rain, that's what I did today! And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here! I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not. You have to come down here! I know."
305,1,22,veterinary ,"So how'd she manage to eat so much chocolate? Oh, that's so sweet. Nobody does that. No, honey... nobody does that. But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic. I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now."
306,1,22,voice mail," Hello, Lily, this is Janet Kagan at the Russell House Art Foundation here in San Francisco. I'm pleased to inform you that we've accepted your application for our summer fellowship. We look forward to hearing from you. Bye-bye."
307,1,22,waiters ,"Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy birthday, happy, happy, happy, happy, appy, happy birthday, happy, happy..."
308,1,22,weather man," And so tropical storm Willy is going to be with us at least until Monday. It's gonna rain cats and dogs, folks. So don't step in a poodle. Sandy? Robin? ..sending the storm back out into the Atlantic. So it's blue skies this weekend. Sandy? Robin?  Pushing the front back into the Tri-State area and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade."
309,1,22,,"Ted from 2030: It was May of 2006 in New York City and life was good. But everything was about to change. Ted from 2030: The funny thing was, at that very moment, the universe was working on something... a storm. Ted from 2030: Let's pause. See, Marshall and Lily had a rule that at any point during a fight they could pause and take a break. Their fights often lasted for days. Ted from 2030: And so the three of us headed up to the roof of my building. Ted from 2030: And that's how Robin and I ended up together. Turns out, all I had to do was make it rain. As I rode home the next morning, the city looked the same, the people looked the same. It all looked the same. But it wasn't. In just one night, everything had changed."
310,2,1,barney ,"I didn't get your message until I woke up. Bro, I am so sorry. I know it must be tough. But are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better but will actively excite you? For the first time ever, the three of us are single at the same time. I've dreamed about this day boys and it's going to be legendary! Together, we will own this city. Any time, a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriend, we'll be there. Any time a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge-drinking, we will be there. Any time a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo sticking their heads out, shouting ""What's up New York?"" we will be what is up New York! Gentlemen, we are about to embark on... (While he's speaking, Barney looks at Ted and then at Robin). Oh man, you guys did it, didn't you?! So he stays home all the time not getting laid? No, see, that's what you do when you have a fiancée. He should be down here celebrating. He's free. He got that red-head-tumor removed. You know what Marshall needs to do? He needs to stop being sad. When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story. Have you tried breast-feeding? Nailed it! Mmm. Sunshine. Do you know why you're not over Lily yet? It's 'cause you can still picture her naked. You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs. It's a scientific fact. The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images, or BPEGs and your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's. They won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs. Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs so we begin here tonight my friend. Two at the time. Those count as four. So what's your prescription, Dr Oestrogen? Eat H&auml;agen-Dazs and Watch Love actually until your periods sync up? (Ted and Barney laugh) Those charges are from a month ago. For new charges, you have to go to her online account. You can see credit card activity from like two hours ago. But... You know... Don't... (Marshall leaves the bar, running). He needs her password. Its not like he has her password. Ooh, he has her password. This is... He has her password. You want me to baby-sit him? 20 bucks. An hour. And money for pizza. OK, I'll do it! Stop being a couple. No! Bold. Bold to go for the car. Barney. We're at a fundraiser helping young women raise money for college. Yeah, he's here and he's great. Hang on. Marshall, tell Ted... Uh-oh. He's gone. Crap, you're right. OK, here is the plan. Here is the plan. You go down to the hotel and find him. I'll stay here and get a lap dance. Bye Ted!"
311,2,1,george clinton," Only the best for my little Lily Pad.  I am so glad you agreed to play tennis with me.  I got you a gift.  I bet that's something he made you promise to tell nobody.  I love you too, Lily. That's right Marshall, she's all mine. Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair."
312,2,1,lily ,"Marshall, I'm sorry. I just... I just need to go to San Francisco and do this art program and figure out who I am outside of us. And the only way that I can do that is if we don't talk for a while. Wow, Mario's bistro. What a perfect place to whore around. Oh funk legend George Clinton, I am so glad you spotted me at your concert an drag me on stage to dance with you Courteney Cox style. Oh you know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years but I didn't do it because I never truly loved him. Oh! A ferret. I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace. I've always wanted one, but Marshall have this secret phobia of ferrets. It was! Oh, I love you funk legend George Clinton. Oh, this is so embarrassing. I could've sworn I have some change. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Oh, here we go. No that's, that's a button... It was a button. Do you take credit cards?"
313,2,1,man ,"Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Sunshine! Yankee's fans, please turn your attention to the Diamond Vision for a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise."
314,2,1,marshall ,"So that's it? We're breaking up? For a while? Try never, OK? You walk out that door and we're done. You're never gonna hear my voice again. I should call her. You're a good friend Ted. Well, she left. And I don't even know if she's coming back. Thanks. Sure. Hey Ted. What's the point? I could it some food, it's just gonna leave me. Lily always made the pancakes. God, I loved her pancakes. So soft. So warmed. So perfectly shaped. Beer. Fine. Than I'll just have the leftover So, I find her shampoo. I guess she left it here. It smells like her. Like lavender and seashells. Hope. Somehow erotic and comforting all at the same time. Oh. Sorry. Oh! OK, you're right. I won't call her. I will not call her. Well, I called her. And get this, she changed her number. Well like I'm gonna stalk her or something? Like she's so special?! Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there? 'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her, based on the brief conversations I had with them! Yeah. Hey Robin. Anyway, one of the Lily Adrins... Barney, I really don't think this is gonna help. There are a lot of them. I gotta admit, it is really nice to be outside. It's all a big lie! She's just gonna break your heart! (Men drag Marshall out of the stadium) You can drag me outta here, but she has no soul! Oh my God! How long have you been doing this? Um, you know, Ted is kinda against g*ns.Robin (turning to Marshall, her g*n still in her hand): That's why Ted never gonna find out about this. Whoa! That sort of got scary with me holding a g*n, didn't it? No, I just mean, please don't tell Ted. You wanna try? Only hell, yes. Oh yeah, yeah. This is what I needed. I felt so powerless this whole time but this... This is power, this is... (He shoots and falls down) Yeah sure. Absolutely. Dude, I'm doing much better. In fact, take my car. It's Lily's credit card bill. She must have forgotten to switch her address. I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there. I know, but I just... August 5, one charge - tickets. To what? George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars. August 10, one charge, Tennis Emporium. August 18, two charges. Mario's bistro and - get this - Pet Palace. You guys see what it means right? Because, Robin, they are like fuzzy tube-shaped rats. There is a charge from earlier today. The Kellet Hotel, on Fifth. I don't believe this. Lily is back in New-York. (...) I can't believe this. Lily's in New-York? I guess I'd been thinking when she got back she's call me. That's the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer. OK, you know what? I'm calling her. Ted, I know I shouldn't do this but I have to! Hello, Lily Aldrin's room please. Thank you. Ted, I can't hang up now. Hello?! (He hangs up) A guy answered. There is... There is a guy in her room. I'm going down there. I have to go down there and I have to tell her I love her. I have to beg to take me back even if I have to tell on my knees. Really? Why not? Hey. Well, I went up to Lily's floor... Yeah. It wasn't Lily's boyfriend. Yeah. I don't know. Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her. I don't know where she is or what she's doing. She was my whole life man and now she's... She's gone. Ted. I was high that day. I was. I was so high I thought you were the dean. OK.OK! Resolved. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being OK. Cheers. It's Sunday. It's pancakes day."
315,2,1,robin ,"Hey! So, did you hear the big news? Oh my god! I... I'm so sorry. What happened? Hey, cut her some slack! She's our friend too. She's just trying to figure out who she is. What? Teddy bear... (They kiss, Barney mimes his death with a sword. Ted and Robin look at him and keep kissing) That's my shampoo. I thought he's never go to sleep. Already? I don't hear anyth...Ted (going out of the bedroom): He's calling her! (Tackling Marshall) Argh! Does he know I'm in here? This has to stop! Ted, we just started dating. We agreed we don't wanna move too fast and yet somehow we have a baby. He can't feed himself, he cries a lot, he keeps us up all night... He slept on our floor last night Ted. It is time for some tough love. We need to get him out of that apartment. He needs fresh air. He needs sunshine. See, this is the problem with guys, you don't know how to deal with heartbreak. Yeah, that's the stuff. My Dad taught me to shoot when I was a kid. Now, whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here and it reminds me that... g*ns are fun! I should have mention the recoil. Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side. (We see Marshall sh**ting and laughing maniacally ) Oh! What do I win? You are? That's so nice! Wow, it must be a nice house. I saw pictures of your uncle. This is so great. We'll finally get some time alone. Are you sure Marshall is gonna be OK with this? Yeah. Why are you afraid of ferrets, they are adorable. This has been holding in together? Marshall! Marshall, you can't do that! I didn't say a thing. I didn't say a thing. Yeah, tough love, not hand the guy a noose. No, I'm a g*n enthusiast. The Second Amendment protects my right to bear arms... A little. Is there a hot tube at your uncle's place? Ted. Ted you should see this."
316,2,1,stripper ,Already?
317,2,1,ted ,"OK, where was I? It was June 2006 and life had just taken an unexpected turn. Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important. It's all part of the story. No. The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful. For me, it started out great. (In 2006, Ted and Robin are kissing after the rain dance) In fact, day one was amazing. I'd finally gotten together with Robin. But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life, your Uncle Marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his (Ted finds Marshall on their stairs, holding in his hand Lily's engagement ring). No! No! If you call her, when she asked you not to, you're just gonna look weak and you're gonna regret it. Now, listen. Whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first... and I will punch you in the face. You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up and Lily is gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night? Yeah, I think he knows. Hey Marshall. Are you hungry? At least in that scenario, you get to do the dumping. Come on, it's Sunday, it's pancakes day! Are we still talking about her pancakes? Come on, you gotta eat something. What can I get you? No, that's what you had for dinner. You should write and illustrate children's books. It's only been a month. He just needs to goat his own pace. Anyway, lily is the one who caused this whole mess. Figure out who she is? She should call me. I got a whole list. She's selfish, she's immature, she's... God, your eyes are so blue. Uh-oh. He's calling her. Dammit! They were together nine years. It's only been a month and a half. He just needs to go his own pace. He watched a scary movie. Yeah, this is fun, right? We're outside, it's a beautiful day. The Indians are winning! Oh, no. (A man is proposing to his girlfriend. Marshall stands up and throws a hotdog at the engaged couple.) We've tried everything. Baseball, strippers. The guy still won't eat a damn pancake. I think he's beyond repair. I'll hand it to you. When he got home, Marshall was smiling. Did you sleep with him? 'Cause I was actually like three days away from suggesting that. Well, congratulations. You're the first person to cheer him up all summer. You win. I'll tell what you win. I'm taking you away this weekend. My aunt and uncle have a beach house at Montauk. It's really romantic. My uncle had, like, three affairs there. Really? Hey, thanks. And hey, if you need anything, day or night, just call me. You know what? Please don't call me. What? What's wrong? So? No, no. No good can come from looking at this. You've made too much progress already. That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. Exactly! Why do you talk? Why do you talk? No! You're not calling her. This changes nothing. (To Barney) You, come here. (Barney and Robin follow Ted in the kitchen). While we're away this weekend can you keep an eye on him? Make sure he doesn't call her hotel. Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this. (To Robin) Come here my little baby. (Ted and Robin are making out) Marshall! Marshall! Everything we've worked so hard for...! Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up! Dude, you can't... Because you're pathetic! I'm sorry. But right now, you are not Marshall. You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily. You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line? Marshall. The real Marshall. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car? What? You think I was too hard on him. I can't believe you're accusing me to be too hard on him. You're the one who said tough love. Oh, but it's OK to hand him a 9 mm? Yeah. He told me. So you're a g*n nut? Do you know how many people are k*lled... Alright, alright. I was too hard on him. I'm gonna call Barney, see how they're doing. Uh, hey. Where are you guys? Strip-club. Nice. Is Marshall OK? What? What uh-oh? You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel. Barney![End of the phone call] A really nice one. Hi. Uh, could you tell me what room Lily Aldrin's in? Thanks. Marshall! What happened? You knocked out Lily's new boyfriend? What? Who was he? So Lily is not back in town and she doesn't have a boyfriend. That's good news, right? You know, first day at college, I showed up, I was so freaked out and I got up to my room and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall. He had headphones on, a big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap. Happy. Confident. Not afraid of anything. That guy was you. You before you met Lily. Yeah. What I'm saying is, there's a version of you without Lily and... It's not this. You can't let Lily stole your identity the way that guy stole hers. Cheers. Oh, what now? Marshall? What are you doing?"
318,2,1,ted's daughter,Can't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom? I feel you've been talking for like a year
319,2,1,ted's son, Can I go to the bathroom?
320,2,1,,"Ted from 2030: One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning (Ted and Robin are making out) and love is ending (Lily is leaving the apartment, leaving Marshall alone) the first thirty days are remarkably similar. (DAY ONE, Ted and Robin are in bed after they had s*x) For one thing, you spend most of the time in bed (Marshall is in his bed groaning // DAY EIGHT, Ted and Robin are at MacLaren's with Barney, kissing and laughing. Barney seems to k*ll himself, miming a g*n in his mouth) Your friends can't stand to listen to you (DAY SIXTEEN, Barney is with Marshall who is crying and says ""It was a really beautiful song"". Barney mimes a rope around his neck). And you never seems to wear pants. (DAY TWENTY-TWO, at the apartment, Robin is going to the bathroom only wearing a T-shirt while Marshall is wallowing on the couch in underpants. Ted, in underpants too, comes out of his room). Ted from 2030: Yeah it was hard to feel too bad. I was dating the woman of my dreams and things were going great. Well, for the most part. (Ted and Robin are watching TV, Marshall comes out of the bathroom, a bottle of shampoo in his hand). Ted from 2030: 56 days. That's how long it took me to get right about here. Marshall:...and I had this little speech in my head. Everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect. I knocked on the door. (A man is opening the door and Marshall is punching him in the face). Ted from 2030: His name was Joey Adalian. He went by a number of aliases as an identity thief. Apparently, earlier in the summer... Waiter/Joey Adalian: Yes, I do.[End of flashback] DAY FIFTY-SEVEN, at the apartment.Ted from 2030: But it wasn't. 'cause that's no how life works. The next day he found one of her socks or something and we were back to square one. And then, one morning... Ted from 2030: It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes, but Marshall had come back from the dead. Because while baseball, strippers and g*ns can help, the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time."
321,2,2,amy ,"Hey Barney, nice to meet you."
322,2,2,barney ,"You just checked out Robin's ass. Dude, that's awesome! You're finally forgetting about that short redhead. Yes, Lily, thank you. That was gonna drive me crazy all night. Hey, Ted! Marshall's just checked out your girlfriend's ass. This is the moment I've been waiting for. Starting tonight, I'm gonna teach you how to live. Ted, you're out of chance, Marshall's in. Marshall, being a single guy in New York city is like... Pfff... What does everybody like? Yeah! It's like being in a candy store. You just walk right in and grab yourself some Whoppers. Yeah. Is Whoppers the best ones? Milk Duds. Um... Nice! Marshall, we're doing this. I am not taking no for an answer. Hi. Have you met Marshall? I-I-I Hate to interrupt but, uh... Do you like magic? Dude, you were awesome last night. You were charming, you were funny. You were totally working that girl. Yes, I did. But she told me that if it wasn't for me you would've had a shot with her. So in hypothetical terms, you scored last night! All right! Hypothetical high five! Nice! Tonight, we're gonna go to the bar... Come on! I'll teach you all my strategies! My favorite, number seven. Create a mystery about yourself. That way, they become so intrigued that they have to hang out with you all night. Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't. Let's review Barney's rules for mating without dating. Lesson two: corollary five. Excellent. Have you chosen your entrée? Her? Really? No, you're right. Ambition is the enemy of success. OK, hit it. Nice recovery. I think it's working. Hi. Amy, do you like... magic? I am so sorry. It's a sickness. I'm the real victim here. I know but tonight... I'm taking a leak, dumb-ass. Marshall Eriksen, suit up! Yeah you're good in that. Let's go. Come on... There is nothing in my sl... Huh? Huh? Let's go. Oh there is nothing behind your... Ohh! Hi, I'm Barney. Do you mind giving my friend your phone number? Sorry buddy, I'm taking this one too. I'm not giving you... Stop it! Stop! If we can't settle this like gentlemen, then no one gets the number. (He sends the card across the window). No, wait. Come on. Wait. Marshall! 81st and 1st please. (He pulls the card out of his sleeve). Oh, she does have a cute handwriting. Hi Marshall. OK. I know what I did a couple nights back was is in a moral grey area. But the great news is she loved you. If things had gone your way, you'd gone out a couple time, I think she definitely would've had s*x with you. You can't give up now. What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes, only this time you get her and I don't. Oh, but it is. She has... Wait for it. Here it comes. Almost there...an identical twin. Yes! Of course, it is. What do you think ""identical"" means? ""Ident-"" - same. ""-ical"" - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date. Ah! Used-up? They're a human being Marshall. How are you doing? You are. You definitely are. Listen, you're gonna have to leave now. I just talked with the twins and, get this, I'm going home with both of them! Yeah. That's happening. But they're twins. Well, it's not like a candy store. It's a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. I may be your best friend... Yeah. I guess we're just a threesome tonight. So then, I was promoted to assistant ménage-er. Manager. Why do I keep doing that? (Lily arrives.) Lily? So, where was I? Ah yes. Assistant ménage-er. I did it again. I can't believe it! Wait, wait, I know magic. Well played, Eriksen. Well played."
323,2,2,girl ,"Hi Marshall. Amy. Don't worry, I've been there. Hold on. Yeah, I'm in pre-law. The workload's k*ll*ing me though. Listen, I gotta go. But it'd be great to see you again. Maybe I'll see you here sometimes. You know, I do have a phone number. Sure."
324,2,2,lily ,"It is a great ass. Thank you! (They hug) I am doing great. This summer, best thing ever. San Francisco is so happening right now. Oh, the art program, best thing ever. But the best part of SF - oh that's what we call San Francisco - the people. Even just riding around on the bus all summer, it was like a human tapestry. But I need the freedom to really chase my passion, which was painting but now, I think it's music, or spoken words. Maybe both. God, isn't life amazing. It is so great to see you Ted. Ah! I'm gonna get the key for the lockbox. And then I discovered this area, North beach. Best beach ever! Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer. How are you guys doing? And hey, how is Marshall? That is so good to hear. (Lily's phone rings). Oh, hold on. This could be about he apartment. (She leaves the room). I didn't get it. That first apartment. I... I waited too long and somebody else got it. (She starts crying). The apartment is a metaphor for Marshall! (Robin gives back Ted his five dollars) Shhh! Bring me the dirtiest, greasiest tuna melt you got. And a milkshake. What are you charpy about? I was dying to ask. I was just trying to play it cool. But really... Say something about Marshall. Where is Marshall? How's Marshall? What's Marshall doing right now? (They are now with Ted in an other building) Shut up and talk about Marshall. Shut up and talk about Marshall! Shut up and talk about Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Aaah I gotta ask! (Then, the three of them are in Robin's apartment) And, hey, how is Marshall? It was such an awful summer! I just wanted to get back here and see him. Not exactly... Yeah, um... I never got in touch because I was too embarrassed. I screwed everything up. I have no job, no place to live. I lost the love of my life. Look, I know I have no right to ask this but do you think Marshall would take me back? Wow. So, maybe I should call him? Oh, I-I was just walking by. I wasn't... Oh, you mean, New-York? My program ended. It was just great. Just lots of fun. It was awful. It was the worst mistake I ever made. I'm so sorry Marshall. And, hello. I know. It was the worst summer of my life. Can we please get back together? Can we please get back together? Wow. OK. Yeah. Wi... Will we still see each other? Thanks. I, uh, figured, new city, new color - uh, old color. (Music 'It's gonna be different this time' / Later). And the pizza there. Worst pizza ever! I'm so glad to be back in New-York. Listen, if there is anything I can do to even begin to make things up to you. You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk! (She throws a drink at his face and leaves) You gave my twin sister Chlamydia! You slime! (She throws a second drink at his face and leaves, following by the twins)."
325,2,2,man ,"Oh my God, this is your best work. In all my years teaching, I've never seen anything so... Needless to say, this is art! I can't teach you anything. (The man is giving Lily his paintbrush). Oh my God! This is your best work?! In all my years teaching I've never seen something so... needless. To say this is art... I can't teach you anything. I'm Mike. I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure writer travel."
326,2,2,man 2," I'm Dan. I'm a neurosurgeon. You are stunning, by the way."
327,2,2,marshall ,"See ya. What? No. I... Barney, I was... Lily. I did not Ted... Oh, God! Candy. Fine. Ted, what is wrong with you? Hi. Look how sweaty my hands are! It's weird, right? Uh, sweat. Like this... Smelly water coming out of your skin. It was nice meeting you. You went home with her! Barney, no, I'm not going out with you ever again. Oh, really? Oh, come on. Does that really work? Dammit that's intriguing! OK, I'm in. Unbelievable? What's unbelievable? Way to go. Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive and she'll be putty in your hands. I have. A sweet brunette, eight o'clock. Nine o'clock. Ten; thirty. She's walking to the bar. Hey four-eyes. You got astigmatism or something? I'm sorry, I was trying to be playful but I just got out of a lonf relationship. I have no idea what I'm doing! I'm Marshall. Um, Amy, this is my friend Barney. Barney, this is Amy. I hate you. Twice! Twice in a row you took my candy! That was my candy! No, forget it. You're such a jackass! OK, but no magic. (He turns to Barney who disappeared). How did you do that? No way. Wait. Empty your pockets. Come on. Sleeves. Oh is that right? Behind my ear. Ohh! Oh, tell me about it. I'm a third year at Columbia Law, so... If the workload does k*ll you I can probably get a conviction. Yeah. Yes, it would. It really would. Probably not. I'm never here, so... Great. Nice. Oh, no. Whoo! I did it! I got a girl's phone number! Oh, and her handwriting is so cute. Look. I'll take her out for Chinese food and then we'll walk through the park. It'll be so... What? I'll k*ll you! Gimme the card! I swear I'm gonna... You don't want to see me when I'm angry! Stop the cab! (Marshall gets out of the car) No, go away, I don't want to talk to you. There is no ""would"" in s*x. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it. That's not possible. A twin isn't the same person. Fine. But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin. Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking. It is impossible that you're doing this to me again. You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store. Ted's my best friend. Lily. What are you doing here? Lily, this was the worst summer of my life. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. All that crap you said to me about ""we need to figure out who we are outside of us, and we need to learn to do things on our own."". It broke my heart. Three months ago, you broke my heart. Lily, you were right. All that crap was right. So, no. No, we can't get back together. We shouldn't. At least, not right now. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I don't know. This is all really new to me. I just got out of a long relationship. I like your hair. Yeah. Actually, there's maybe something you can do for me. But you can never ever ask me why."
328,2,2,robin ,"Alright, see you guys later. He checked out my ass? Hey, tell him thanks. I felt like I was having a bad ass day. Cool. See ya. Lily. Your hair is adorable! You've gotta hear this. You go first. Lily is back in town. Uh, yeah. I actually went apartment hunting with her today. You're not gonna like it. Wow, I am so happy for you. You never chose sides. I respect that. Ted found a penny on the subway and it's old and that's interesting. No, we don't. He's just starting to get better. Going out with Barney. How do you think he'll feel when he hears Lily's moved on? Well, it happens. I've fallen out of love faster than that before. Sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever. One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me. But we're great! Honey? What? No, you just want Lily to be miserable. The truth is she's happy. Trust me, I'm a girl! Why do you always have to bring that up? You bring it up every time... You're on. Dammit! OK, so how do we get the truth out of her? No, Lily you're crying over the crown moulding and the real hardwood floor. There's no deeper meaning, right Lily? Just quit crying and tell him. I'd take you with gravy if my boyfriend wasn't sitting right here! Just kidding. I'm good. I don't think so! Whoo! But it's good, I mean work's great... This guy like pennies!"
329,2,2,ted ,"I'll walk you out. Awesome! You're finally getting better. Yes! Mounds. Gobstoppers. Dubble Bubbles. Hey Robin. Marshall checked out your ass. You will not believe what just happened. I find a 1939 penny on the subway. Just imagine the history this little copper guy's seen... And you let me go first?! Have you seen her? How is she doing? She's happy? Marshall had the worst summer of his life and she's happy. And I suppose her art program was fulfilling or whatever. Oh, she's such a... godda... God! After what she did to Marshall, she should come back here devastated. Crawling over the broken glass of her own shame and regret. She's unbelievable! Unbelievable! Uh, listen Marshall... OK, first of all, that is interesting. Second, we have to tell him. She's moved on? Yeah. She's miserable. She's realized she's made a huge mistake. Her and Marshall will be back together in a week, I love it! Trust me. I've known Lily for nine years. Yeah. But you're Canadian. You're our weird neighbors! No, alright. Five bucks says she still wants Marshall. Five American bucks. Tequila. It's her weakness. Three shots, she tells you the truth about anything. Terrific. OK, we're way past truth-telling Lily and about to hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998 Lily, and I'm not cleaning that up again. So, congratulations. You win, she's happy. Interesting. Wow Lily, you, uh, seem to be having a pretty strong reaction to losing this apartment. I wonder is it because it reminds you of something you lost because you couldn't commit? Gravy. Surprise me. She's still drunk from last night. Look, if you want Marshall back so bad, how come it took you two days to ask about him? But I thought your summer was great?! So all those interesting people you met on the bus...? In a heartbeat. If you called him up, yeah, he'd take you back with open arms. Maybe. No! This is... Ooww... Hold on. Look. If you're gonna go back to him, I don't wanna hear the word ""maybe"". ""Maybe"" cannot be in your vocabulary. This break-up almost k*lled him. And he cannot go through it again. So, unless you're absolutely certain, stay the hell away from him."
330,2,2,twin 1, What?
331,2,2,twin 2, That's so bad. I really liked him.
332,2,2,waiter ,"Morning guys, what can I get you? For you, sir? You want that gravy on something?"
333,2,2,woman ,"Hi. Umm... I guess. (Barney makes a trick, Umm, I guess is writing on his hand). Oh my God! (Barney does it again, Oh my God! appears on his hand) Anyway, Marshall here is awesome. Salad in a bag? His idea! I'm Paula. I sing in a punk band for children. Yeah!"
334,2,2,,"Ted from 2030: Marshall and Lily have together for nine wonderful years until she dumped him and ran off to San Francisco. The healing process was taking a long time. Then, one night he made a giant leap forward. Ted from 2030: This went on for another hour. I'll just skip to the end. Ted from 2030: None of us had seen Lily in three months. There were so many unanswered questions, so many things to say. At MacLaren's.Ted from 2030: Meanwhile, Barney was taking Marshall out to meet women for the first time since he was 17. In San Francisco, in a bus.Man 1: Hi, I'm Mike. I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure writer travel. Barney (with you're a jerk writing on his hand): I though you were gonna call me a jerk. All right, I'm sorry. But I will make it up to you. Tonight, we'll go to a college bar near NYU. The Scorpion & The Toad. I figure in a younger crowd you'll seem more mature, more worldly. And, as a third-year law student, more smarter. In a building.Ted from 2030: Robin and I went apartment hunting with Aunt Lily. (Lily come back.)Lily: I hope this is my new home. (She comes in the apartment) Yeah, I'm gonna take that first apartment. In an other spot of the Scorpion & the Toad.Barney (to a girl): You must be majoring in chemistry 'cause what I'm picking up between us is, uh... (The girl leaves / to the girl's friend) College lesbian phase. In a snack-bar.Ted from 2030: About hangovers - everyone has their own special remedy. Ted from 2030: So Uncle Marshall and Uncle Barney went out on a double date with the twins. Barney:...but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is. And after nine years of captivity, that is the single greatest lesson I can teach you about surviving in the wild. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have two unique breasts an two duplicates waiting for me. (Barney rejoins the twins, Marshall leaves the bar). Oh bad news. Marshall got food poisoning."
335,2,3,all ,Hi.
336,2,3,barney ,"I can't say I blame you. Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch. That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part. I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology. I can't say I blame you. Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them. What? But I'm your best friend. I'm the most important person in your life. How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful. Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today. Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you. That needlepoint ""Bless This Mess"" pillow you made for Ted - what a stitch. Stitch! Did that just happen? (Ted's parents and Barney laugh) San Marino! Oh, you're serious? Yikes. No. We have to try Casa A Pezzi. Best salmon risotto I have ever had. I know. Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because... Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin? Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five! Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it. No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening. Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's? St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m., it's my favorite service. I'll save you a seat. Susan, her name is Virginia. Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now. Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right? Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry. I'm... oh. (They hug). I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom. Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back... I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that? Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side. You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people at www.swingers.open-marriage-is-natural-legalize-polygamy.org have, and they beg to differ. Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real T-shirt for running in their 10K. Well, you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene, that's for sure. Ooh, a piano! What happened to Marshall and Lily? You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that. Ooh, no line at the omelet station."
337,2,3,girl ,"Wow. You're like a hero. You poor, brave man."
338,2,3,lily ,"I wish your face would melt off. I hate you. Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby. I was just stopping by to pick up some of my things. Me begging Marshall to take me back and him rejecting me? Um... Well, I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable. Well, I mean, yeah, we're... We're good, but you got to admit there's that stuff between us. ""Brother and sister""?! Okay. Fine, yeah, I'll see you at the restaurant, bro. (She leaves) Hello, everyone. Hello, Marshall. Oh, thanks. It's kind of revealing, but I thought, ""Hey, we're all family."" Right, bro? Ooh, ah... Oh, I, I hurt my ankle in yoga today. The instructor told me to just take deep breaths to get through the pain, just... (She breathes deeply while Marshall glances at her low neckline) Are you all right? You're kind of sweating. Hey. How are you feeling? You looked kind of feverish last night. Oh, I don't know, if anything, it's kind of... (Marshall starts unzipping his knee zips) What are you doing? Take off the rest of your pants. I really wasn't expecting that to happen. Yeah, it does. Why did you have to throw your magnificent calves at me? You know you have a punter's leg. Just admit it, you came here trying to seduce me. You sat down next to me and took most of your pants off. How is that seducing you? All right, that's it - I want The Beatles Anthology. You are evil. Whoops. I think I dropped an ice cube down here. Ow, it's so cold. Me, too. Thanks again for letting me have the U2 box set. Just a minute. Marshall, your zipper. I wish your face would melt off. Me, too. It's the same for me. I think we're probably both better off trying to keep some distance for a while. Did you Mystic Tan your calves?"
339,2,3,marshall ,"I wish your eyeballs would explode. I hate you more. Good to see you. Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me? Actually, we're cool. We just divided up CDs. It was all very civil. I'm proud of us. Wwe're, we're good. What? Why would it? Um, not for me. Now it's just like we're friends. It's like we're brother and sister. No, I'm fine. It's just... This roll is really spicy. Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to torture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too. No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves. Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs. Hello. Oh, no, I actually feel great. It is kind of warm in here, though, isn't it? Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just making myself feel a little bit more... comfortable. (He starts massaging his calve) Oh. Oh, yes. I've been doing all these toe lifts lately, and so... My calves have really been cramping up. Take off your dress. Yeah, me neither. It kind of complicates things, doesn't it? Well, why did you have to throw your beautiful boobs at me? You know you have... boobs. Seduce you? You seduced me. You went to San Francisco for three months. Well, it's not but I'm still mad about it. Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm keeping it! And you know the U2 box set I gave you? Look inside - all Dave Matthews. All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute. I know how important it is to you. Maybe less. Excuse me. Sorry. Didn't know that there was a line. I wish your eyeballs would explode. Lily... I'm sorry that I said all those things. I just find it really confusing to be around you right now. Yeah, I think you're right. Are you wearing a push-up bra? I withdraw the question."
340,2,3,robin ,"I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him. Okay, if you don't, I will. Hey. To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have. Hello. That's funny, I didn't even ""look"" in the mirror today. That's not anything, is it? So, I made a reservation at San Marino tonight for 8:00. How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks. What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass. No, I'm kind of tired. Robin. I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him. Okay, if you don't, I will. But this is the first time she's meeting me. But I don't want to get married and have kids. What am I supposed to say? I'm gonna lie. Oh, boy. I'm just not ready. Oh. Uh, I thought you, um... It's great. Oh, absolutely. Whew, what a relief it is to know I'm the one girlfriend your mom doesn't want you to have kids with. I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl would pop out attractive children? 'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry, that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman. Well, if she's so sweet, maybe she should have Ted's babies. Nothing. (She leaves the table to go to the bathroom, the door is locked, she knocks.) Why don't you want me to have your grandkids? No! I mean, I don't know. I just... I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids. And you should. I'm a genetic gold mine. No family history of diabetes or heart disease. Everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight. I had one schizophrenic uncle but even he had perfect vision. Which was unfortunate for the people around the bell tower he was in, but still he was a very fine man, and... Why do you say that? I mean, you got married pretty young. That wasn't a mistake. Was it? I don't care how unpleasant it is, you have to talk to him. Okay, if you don't, I will. Mrs. Mosby? Wow. They love me!"
341,2,3,ted ,"Kids you know that photo in the den? It was taken back in 2006, when Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me and we all went out to brunch. We all look pretty happy, right? Wrong. I'm going to k*ll him. No, I mean I'm seriously going to k*ll him. You mean the spa the judge ordered him to go to to quit coca1ne? What's wrong? Hey, Marshall. I'm going to k*ll him. No, I mean I'm seriously going to k*ll him. Barney, what are you doing here? I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories. Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about: baseball. Well, actually Marshall's my... Well, Robin's actually... Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. I know you've all been excited to meet... Uh, Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend, Robin. Stop it! Don't, don't! Yeah, I'm sure my folks are gonna want... Cervezas? Did he fall? Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church? Why? My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool? Sure. Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God! My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible. Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use ""83%""? That's not a real Web site. Hi, Dad. Enjoying your vacation so far? Uh, listen, can I speak to you outside for a sec? So you went out with Barney last night? You have a good time? Yeah. So... Well... You think Cerrano's got a shot at the RBI title? I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't. I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about-anything-uncomfortable gene One last thing about my mom. She grills every single one of my girlfriends about when we're gonna get married and have kids. Doesn't matter. And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin Stacy: six kids in five years. The woman's basically a ride at a water park. You know what? You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions. You shouldn't have to apologize for them. I would. Oh, good for her. You lucked out with my mom last night, huh? What a relief, right? Hooray? Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important. They've been fighting lately. They're probably off somewhere going at it. I'm gonna k*ll him. Sweetheart? Sweetheart?! The only sweetheart in your life should be the woman you married 30 years ago, not the waitress at the bar last night and not this clumsy floozy! (To the waitress) I'm sorry, you're not a floozy. I'm upset, I don't know what I'm saying. But stay away from my dad. Dad? You, uh, want to tell Mom what happened at the bar last night? Oh? Serious talk? Mom, what...? He was kissing another woman. Don't you care? What do you mean you're divorced? Since when? So ten months ago, you just up and decided to get divorced without telling me? How could you not tell me this?! So last Christmas...? I got you a tandem bike. Who the hell is Frank?! Okay, my head's about to explode, and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles, so I am leaving. (He leaves, following by his parents and Robin) Thank you. No, this is ridiculous! We have to start talking about stuff, and not just baseball. Against the Red Sox? Boy, that's a big win. No. No. No. We're not gonna blow past this. I mean, I don't even know who you people. I don't even know how you met. No. That's it? That's what passes for communication in our family? Man, when I have kids, and I tell them how I met their mother, I'm gonna tell them everything, the whole damn story. I just, I don't... I don't understand. You seemed so happy. When I was growing up, you seemed so... What happened? So? Robin and I are like that. That doesn't mean anything. Robin and I have different views on families. We're not about to break up because of it. I know. Good. Good, I think it'll be really good for the family. By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't returned my last couple calls. No. No."
342,2,3,ted's father," Oh, Lily! Hi, Marshall.  Oh, hi.  Ted.  Hello.  A real looker.  I feel like I could knock back a few cervezas.  Why don't you give the guy a hug?  Hey, Ted. Barney!  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry you couldn't join us.  What?  Well what?  Oh, gosh, let me help you pick those up, sweetheart.  Okay. I hooked up with a waitress.  Your mother and I are divorced.  Closer to ten, I think.  We'd been separated almost two years.  We talked about telling you kids then, but it didn't seem very Christmasy.  Oh, it didn't go to waste. Your mother and Frank ride it all the time.  Oh, great guy. I actually set them up. You remember Dr. Muchnik. He did your braces.  But listen, don't tell your sister.  Indians won today on a walk-off double.  I never told you how I met your mother?  Oh, great story. At a bar.  I think it was an Irish bar.  We just realized we're very different people.  I wanted kids. And your mother... also wanted kids.  Well, when you don't connect on that many fundamental levels, it's only a matter of time before you realize you're not meant to be together.  Absolutely. Meeting you was the highlight of my trip. Well, second highlight.  Sorry.  From now on, full disclosure.  You missed a great game last night. Real squeaker."
343,2,3,ted's mother," Not now.  Robin...! (She lifts her arm and hits the waitress who falls down.)  Oh, I forgot to tell you, your cousin Jimmy had a wonderful time at that spa he visited.  Coffee?  Yes, we were so sorry to hear about your... You know, the, the... Well...  I love your hair.  Well, we were all going to go to Casa a Pezzi at 8:00. Lily, would you like to join us?  Lily, that is a stunning dress.  Oh, it's wonderful to meet you, Robin. Oh, you are so pretty. Isn't she pretty, Al?  I love salmon risotto.  Can I help?  Well, funny you should ask...  That is my all-time favorite sonata.Barney, you are just delightful.  I'd join you, too, but I want to get up early for Mass tomorrow.  Oh, you are just terrific. Isn't he, Susan?  Not now.  Robin...! (She lifts her arm and hits the waitress who falls down.)  I talked to Aunt Caroline the other day. Stacy's pregnant again.  Tell us what it's like being a journalist.  Okay. No pressure.  Good. Focus on your job now, because your career clock is ticking. There's time for marriage and kids and all that other stuff later.  Oh, no, thank you. Isn't she sweet?  Excuse me?  Robin, dear, did I say something to upset you?  Do you want to have my grandkids?  Robin, it's not that I don't want grandkids. It's just I don't think anyone should make the mistake of getting married too young.  Well... Okay, there's something you don't know...  Not now.  Robin...! (She lifts her arm and hits the waitress who falls down.)  Ted, what are you talking about?  Oh.  I mean, oh! Oh! Ooh! We're going to have a serious talk about this when we get home, Al. Oh, ooh!  Ted, we weren't quite sure how to tell you this...  Oh, gosh, it's been about nine months now.  Time flies.  No, it wasn't a snap decision.  We meant to, it just never seemed like the right time.  Teddy bear, oh...  It was wrong not to tell you.  It would just upset her.  Your father's kind of a head-in-the-clouds romantic, and I'm much more down to earth.  On some level, I always knew. I didn't even want to go out with him in the beginning. But he spent months badgering me until I finally gave in.  But we love Robin.  We'll see you inside.  I'm gonna get some juice."
344,2,3,waitress ,More coffee? Smile!
345,2,3,,"Ted from 2030: Okay, for any of this to make sense, you got to understand, there are three parts to this story. Let's start with the Marshall and Lily part. The previous day, at the apartment.Ted from 2030: As a 30th anniversary gift, I had flown my parents to New York for the weekend. Ted from 2030: You know, Grandma and Grandpa didn't like to talk about things that were uncomfortable, emotional, or in any way... real. Ted from 2030: This was only the second time Marshall and Lily had seen each other since breaking up, but to their credit, it wasn't that awkward. Ted from 2030: See? Not awkward at all. Ted from 2030: So Marshall showed up at brunch with a plan. The waitress (taking a photo): Smile! Ted from 2030: Now let's talk about the Barney part of the story. The previous day, at the apartment.Ted from 2030: This was going to be Robin's first time meeting my parents, so we were both a little nervous. At ""Casa a pezzi"". Barney is playing the piano.Ted's father: Whoa! Bravo, Barney. Oh, oh oh! Ted's father (talking to a girl): So Barney darts back into the burning house, lifts up the refrigerator I'm pinned under and pulls me to safety. The waitress (taking a photo): Smile! Ted from 2030: Okay, now I got to back up all the way to the beginning to tell you the me and Robin part of the story. Ted from 2030: We were expecting my parents at any minute. Ted's mother (to Robin): So, dear... Outside.Ted's father: We're sorry we didn't say anything about the divorce. Back inside, later.Ted's mother: So we are definitely going to try and communicate more."
346,2,4,a girl," Ted Mosby, the architect?"
347,2,4,anna ,"Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up! Architects rule! Whoo-hoo. Barney? Who the hell is Barney?"
348,2,4,barney ,"Oh, no, what'd you fight about? (He puts his headphones on). Yeah, you did. Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft. Had to. Can we talk about something else? Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties? Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing. Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God. I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies. That's 'cause you're always like... (Dully) ""Ted Mosby, architect"". If it were me, I'd be like... (Confidently) ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude. Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Trust me. Thank God you're here. Can you help with this? I need nails. Ted? He's at work. Awesome story. As per usual. Sorry, I forgot my binocs for Foxy Boxing. Whoo, looks like things just got a little foxier right here. Yeah, stay (mouthing ""go"") Yeah, you did. Sorry, my, uh... intern had to leave. Ted Mosby... Architect. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building. Galloping. It is tonight. And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here. I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole ""using my real name"" thing. And thus ended this chapter of, ""Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand."" Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower. I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a ""A."" A... A... I'll just put ""resident."" Go, go, go, go."
349,2,4,bouncer ,"You're going to need to refresh my memory. Thanks, but seriously, it was crazy tonight. You really do need to refresh my memory. Ted Mosby, the architect? Oh, yeah, he was here. Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudités. I'm not telling you that for less than 20 bucks. I'll take your purse. Yeah, my girl likes clutches. The building with the green light, apartment 3-C."
350,2,4,carl ,"No. Hey, Lily. You still single? You know... I've poured a lot of free drinks for you over the years. A lot. Only if you're into it. It's on me."
351,2,4,girl ,"Are you kidding? Architects are hot. How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol? Yes, she did. She's a kickboxing instructor. Her ass looks better than my face. Wow. I would love to watch the sun rise with you. So, I know the bouncer at this techno club, Posers. Do you feel like dancing? Yay! Okay. I live across the street. You want to come over? I'll see you at book club, Vinny. Nice. Giddy up! Architects rule! Whoo-hee! How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol? Yes, she did. Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings. Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way."
352,2,4,girl 1," And what made you decide you wanted to become an architect?  I bet you can draw, can't you? You should draw me."
353,2,4,girl 2," Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?  And don't forget the precedent set by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74. Any personal effects she left in your house or dwelling become yours after 30 days.  You should sue her."
354,2,4,girls ,Yeah.
355,2,4,guy 1, Okay! Seriously... Who wants to shave my ass?!  No way.
356,2,4,guy 2," Yo, what's up, ladies? Welcome to the party. Yeah! Just need you to sign this release protecting the host from any and all responsibility should you harm yourself or a third party. Then freakin' rage! Yeah!  You mean Ted Mosby, the architect? Man, what a visionary. Yeah, they were here.  Her name wasn't on your lease, was it? 'Cause if not, New York state law, you're not obligated to give her half the deposit when you move.  The girl with the smackable ass."
357,2,4,kara ,On the grounds of... shut up.
358,2,4,lily ,"So you and Ted had your first fight. It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me. Ooh, two tragedies in one day. Robin! You should work at a su1c1de hotline. Robin, he's upset because you wouldn't listen to him, not because you didn't like some movie. Listening is the foundation of a relationship. And if he's really droning on, you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards. You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI. Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober. That's what I tried to explain to the cop. What the hell comes before ""Q""? Yes. Carl, do you really want to be with a woman who would trade s*x for beer? Thanks. He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay? What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out. Okay, where are the guys and the hooker? See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup. Why? Because I listened to him. It was a strong and nurturing relationship that I threw away like old gum. Did you grow up in that Footloose town? Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine. Okay, fella. Baby knows how this game's played. How's a $20 help your memory? Then can I have the...? That's cool. You keep that. Well, I'm out of money. You should tell her that looks really good with a chocolate boot. Oh, my God, Robin, are you going to kick this girl's ass? 3-C, let's do this. You ready? Those are really nice heels and you already lost the purse. Let's see if it's unlocked. It's unlocked. Okay, get in there and kick some spankable ass. Robin? What? Well, don't stand out here and beat yourself up. Get in there and beat Ted up. I'll handle the slutty kickboxer. Actually, I'll take Ted. Bring it. (They come in) Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay. This is how people act in relationships. Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it."
359,2,4,marshall ,"Well, all skyscrapers kind of look like a... Wow, so it's the whole package. Had to. Yeah, you did. Yeah, you did. You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up. That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck. Your job's not boring. Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off.. I didn't want to ruin the party for everybody this early, but, uh... everyone take a seat. Um... Lily actually called off the wedding this summer to go to San Francisco. So... We're broken up. Yeah, that's not really the part I was worried about, guys. Guys, can we cease and desist with the lawyer speak for a minute? Love died. The love that made you all believe in love, that's dead now. Uh, really? On what ground, Kara? Um... only always. Hello. Oh, Robin, hi. Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. He's, uh... he's working. Dude, dude, what are you doing? You proved it, all right? The whole ""Ted Mosby, architect"" things works. Aren't you a little worried that a certain somebody might find out that you're doing this? This isn't you, Ted. Dude, dude, what are you doing? All right, you proved it. The whole ""Ted Mosby, architect"" thing works. Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted."
360,2,4,robin ,"We had our first fight. It's this big skyscraper in Spokane. It'd be a huge project for his firm. So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company. Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm. The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done. Hey. Good. No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight? Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter. What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster. And then it got ugly. What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like Die Hard. But Field of Dreams? Once is more than enough. It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid. So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie. I guess I don't know how to do that. No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you? Hey, Carl, is Ted still here? I wonder where Ted went. Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier. Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part. I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat. All right, we'll swing by the party. Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers. Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted. Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her? Yes, that's the young lady. Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing. Ted hates clubs. Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to s*x. I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories. He's not answering. Calling Marshall. Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted? Uh, okay. Bye. (She hangs up) Marshall just lied. Ted's cheating on me. Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier. One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair. And the other's a cheating b*st*rd. So these guys... One of them's an architect. That's the one. You know this girl. Where does she live? I'm cashed, too. My purse? Okay, fine. Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse. No room for my g*n. Here. Now where does the rodeo slut live? Yeah... And steal her purse. I can't believe he's cheating on me. You know how many times I could have cheated? Six... no seven. And you know two of them, and they would surprise you. Should I just kick the door in? I'm the problem. You were right. I don't know how to be a girlfriend. I took the nicest guy in the world and I made him a cheater. Let's do this. What do you think you're...? Barney? Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted? How did you get here? But why would you use Ted's name? Everything isn't okay. Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid. And that's why I avoid relationships. You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye? Hey. I brought donuts. And I don't want to brag, but they're filled with jelly. It was... fine. Nothing exciting. How was yours? Yes, I do. I'm sorry about earlier. To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of Field of Dreams. I fell asleep half way through. Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause... You know what, um... What I'm trying to say is... I love being the person you bitch to. So how was your day, Mr. Architect? Obviously. Wow. You know, you didn't mention all the foliage around the base. If you trim that back, the rest would look bigger. Wow. Ted, this is amazing. I don't know. It might come to something. You know, girls find architects very hot. (They kiss)"
361,2,4,ted ,"Well, we just had our first fight. A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building... And if we don't get it, we could go under. Yes. Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front. It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices. That wasn't one. Hey. How was your day? Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was? You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time. So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is Field of Dreams? How do you not like Field of Dreams?! Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter. I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job. Robin thinks so. I love it when you quote Scripture. Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever. Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that? Solid point. She did have hair of gold. Mm-hmm. Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess. Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to. Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right? Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building. I know you would. It's the job. Hell, yeah. I love clubs. I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight, kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum. But sure, let's go dancing. Wait, let me just check with my friend. Hey, Marshall. You up for some super loud, repetitive music that hasn't changed since the mid-90s? Let's go. And then I was all, ""No, Frank Gehry, you're on your own this time."" And that, my dear, was the end of that hack's career. That is one hell of a non sequitur. Well, I don't know. But I suppose I should at least give you a ride home. Hop on. (The girl jumps on Ted's back) Galloping. It is tonight. Whoo! Solid point. And she did have hair of gold. Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands. Excuse us for one second. (To Barney) Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder. Yeah, had to. See ya. (He leaves) Hey. What are you doing here? Thanks. So, uh... how was your night? You really want to hear about boring architect stuff? What? The best part's the last 20 minutes. Oh, I like the way you say that. Hey, you want to see the building that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate? Yes. You don't have to tell me. And, um... just for fun, I've... I've sort of been working on my own idea of what I think the building should be. What do you think? Thanks. It's not like it will ever come to anything. Okay, but I don't want you expecting 78 storeys or anything. (They kiss again)"
362,2,4,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, sometimes your relationship goes so smoothly for so long that you think it will be that way forever. It never is. Both Marshall and Barney: No. Ted from 2030: Now the party was for some of Marshall's classmates from Columbia Law School, who by day were some of the sharpest and most serious young legal minds in the country. By night, however... Ted from 2030: That guy went on to become a Supreme Court justice. Guy 2 (to guy 1): Dude. You should let us shave your ass tonight. Ted from 2030: That's our Attorney General. Ted from 2030: Robin took a long walk that night. She thought about how opening yourself up to another person usually means opening yourself up to going a little crazy. She thought about how much easier it was just to be alone. And then she came to see me. Ted from 2030: You know that time we went to Spokane and I pointed out that skyscraper? That was the first building I ever designed. And that night was the first time I showed anyone my first drawing of it. Anna's apartment. Anna's reading the letter Barney left.Barney's voice: ""Dear Resident... The time we spent together, however long it was, meant the world to me. I would love to see you again, but unfortunately, I cannot. You see, I am a ghost. I can't only materialize once every decade on the anniversary of my death. I chose to spend my one day among the living with you, sweet... Resident. Perhaps we will meet again in another decade, provided you keep your figure. Until then, all my love from the beyond. Barney."""
363,2,5,at maclaren's,
364,2,5,barney ,"Aaaaaaah! The fortress of barnitude? No way. Hmm, normally a prerequisite for the women I bring home, but... pass. That's terrible. Well, see ya. I'd let you, but I don't have any room. Hey I'm at a point in my life where my suits are my family. Look around you Lily. You are in the heart of bachelor country, and as a woman, you are an illegal immigrant here. Now,you can try to apply for a s*x visa, but that only lasts 12 hours. 14 if you qualify for multiple entry. Wow, you really are desperate. Oh okay, you can stay here for two days. But I only have one rule. You can't change anything. See that wall? 300-inch flat-screen. They only sell them in Japan, but I know a guy. Had to ship it over in a tugboat like freakin' King Kong. Yeah. That doesn't go away. Uhm, smells delicious. Lily, what was the first rule again? And what was the second rule? Exactly! There was only one rule and you broke it. Lily, if I wanted a fridge full of groceries or fresh coffee in the morning, I'd be in a relationship. But I don't want to be in a relationship. That's why I make it crystal-clear to every girl that walks through that door that this is not a place to leave a toothbrush. This is not a place to leave a contact lens case. This is a place to leave. Come on, 'll give you a tour. Uh, no flash photography please. Bienvenido to the bedroom. Dig this: King-sized bed, full-sized blanket, one pillow. Everything about this bed says ""our work here is done."" Next we say bienvenue to the bathroom. What, only one towel? What, no hairdryer? You know where I keep that stuff? Your place. Beat it. And the coup de gr&acirc;ce... Yeah, that's right. Patent-pending. And wilkommen to the hallway. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p*rn... Aww, that's sweet. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p*rn, I had mine professionally lit. Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough. No,that's just awesome. So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here, I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else. My apartment does it for me. Hey. Did the cold wake you? Oh,did you try and take a shower? I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel. Okay. I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to... I think I left something on the bookshelf. Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look (he shows her his p*rn) Oh, I'm disgusting. Whoa, uh, okay. Beep beep. Backing up, um... What? No. Yes! Yes. Come on, baby. please, no. You don't understand. What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...? (The girl is gone. To Lily) You're not going anywhere. Live claritin clear. Wow, that was close. That hippie chick wouldn't leave. She was ready to squat here. She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment... Except you. You're better than p*rn. How would you like to extend your stay here? All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife, and scare off the occasional one-night stand. I know,I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles... Really? I'll take it. Can you pass the arts and leisure? (The girl does it. More loudly) Can you pass the arts and leisure? Lily, I can explain... Brava. That was incredible. And that slap was genius. You did not hold back. Fair enough. I have to say, it's kind of nice having food around here for a change. What? You're my wife. You can tell me anything. What did you have in mind? Hey, if my bed's going suit up, it's going to do it right. Want to give it a whirl? All right, I'm going to head out, hit the bars. What are you going to do tonight? Please. (He settles himself on the bed) Eh. After the monologue. Aaaaaah! I can't believe we just... You and I... What have we done? ""Just went to sleep""? I don't sleep in the same bed as a woman and not make a move. How could... You! You spooned me against my will. We... We redecorated my place. We stayed in on a friday night to watch ""Letterman"", and then slept together and didn't have s*x? Oh my God! We're in a relationship! You were supposed to be the vaccine, but you gave me the disease. You gotta go. Uh-uh. You gotta go. ""A certain standard of living""? You didn't pay a single..."
365,2,5,brad ,"Bro, Alanis Morissette rocks! Let me guess: you bought the tickets for you and Lily right before she dumped you. I just got dumped myself. Oh, damn... The zucchini bread is ridonculous. I sort of thought it might be, but it totally isn't. Oh and btw, you totally did not oversell the eggs benny. I mean, why can't two single bros go out and rock brunch Sunday morning-style? This must be destiny. I have two tickets for Mamma Mia! friday night. You like Abba, right? What am I saying?Who doesn't? Anyway, I was gonna take Kara, but now it's all you and me. We're gonna do Broadway, bro style. What do you say? No, I insist. You're my guest. Bro. You got some chocolate on your chin. Still there. I'll get that bad boy. (He licks his serviette and cleans Marshall's chin) So anyway,ah,it's this Saturday. Do you want to come? It gets better.The foliage in Vermont this time of year is ridonc. Yeah,the wedding's at this awesome B&B. Kara and I used to go there. Anyway, there is one room left,and we got it. Walt Whitman Suite, bro. I understand. It's cool. It's the first time I was going to see my college friends since Kara left me. I just... I just miss her so much. (Brad starts sobbing) That's great! You know, uh, they're registered at Pottery Barn. I figure we could go halfsies on a gravy boat. Oh, hey... Hey. (They kiss and Brad give her the flowers) Yeah. Happened last night. Uh, I'm sorry, bro. I should have called you. Well, I didn't mean to hurt... I don't know. I think he's in love with me. Hey, Marshall. It's good. (To ted) Hey, I'm uh... Well,I got to go. I got this thing. So, I guess I'll see you around."
366,2,5,girl ,"No,I've just been watching you sleep. I don't buy into the myth that we need to shower every day. I'm boycotting coffee. You may as well drink the tears of a colombian peasant farmer. God, I love this place. Good thing I don't have a job because I could stay here all day. Wow, you're open about your sexuality and that's one of the reasons I love you. Did I just say that? Oh well. Cat's out of the bag. I love you. Oh my god! Are you married? Is this your wife? Yes? You son of a bitch! I can't believe I let you enter my sacred temple. I just did. I'm so sorry. I-i didn't know he had... Hey,sweetie. Aww. Hey, Marshall."
367,2,5,head waiter, One... Couple?  Really? For brunch?
368,2,5,kara ,"Oh, what was with him?"
369,2,5,lily ,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! Welcome to my new home. Yeah,I know it's small, but it's got character. Thank you. And I am learning Lithuanian from my neighbors. They're great. They're always out there in the hall, you know, cooking and gambling and giving each other haircuts. It's nice. Oh, that's not just a stove. That's a stovenkerator: a combination of a stove, oven and sink and refrigerator. Stovenkerator. Isn't that futuristic? It's kind of a mess. I didn't make my bed this morning, so... That was ""something, something, I am going to something you like a something donkey. Hey, let's break out the fruit basket. Hey, who ate all the...? (Mouse squeaking) Aaaaaah! Ted gave me your spare key. I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here if I had no other choice. But earlier today, I was getting ready to go to sleep and... Wait, can I stay here maybe? You live in a two-bedroom apartment. You have one room just for your suits. Ewww!...Is something some lame, judgmental chick would say, but I say give me multiple high fives. I really am. Why would I change anything? This place is... Perfect. Except for the fact that you don't have a TV. It hurts my eyes. Thank you. There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up... (Barney puts the breakfast in the trash) What are you doing? ""Don't change anything""? There was no second rule. I bought groceries. That counts as changing something? Marshall doesn't have p*rn. And if that doesn't drive them away, there's always your life-sized storm-trooper. Barney... Oh! Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she? Thank you. I'll do it. Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win. Honey, I'm... Barney, what the hell is going on here? How could you? In our own home? (She slaps him) You b*st*rd! Just get out. This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years to put you through medical school? I got breast implants for you. I... (The girl is gone) I was just about to turn on the tears. Yeah, that I just always wanted to do. You know... Oh nah, never mind. Well,if you really wanted to sell this ruse, we should try to make this place a little more... You know, homey. Like... Like a woman would actually live here. Oh,I think we made the right decision going for the custom-made italian sheets. Oh. Ooooh! Oh, I was just going to watch ""Letterman"" but, God this bed is so comfy. I wish you had a TV in here. (Barney turns on a another wall-size TV) Okay, seriously, what do you do for a living? I thought you were going out. Aaaaaaaaaaah! Nothing. Nothing happened. We... We just went to sleep. Hey,it takes two to cuddle. That's what you think a relationship is? Barney. I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself. You let down your guard, and let someone into your life, and... And it actually felt okay. And that terrifies you. Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place, and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living."
370,2,5,marshall ,"One of you guys is very, very lucky because I have... A boom! An extra ticket to the Alanis Morissette concert. Who's in? Damn! I got these tickets like months ago for me and Lily and now I can't find anyone to go with me. This is what I miss about being in a couple. I always had someone to go to concerts with, or farmer's market, or brunch. God, I miss brunch! Oh, you don't think I've tried? Table for one. Um, no, just me. You're right. Who am I kidding? Can I go with you guys? God, I hate being single! The Alanis Morissette concert. No,actually I went with a friend from law school. Brad. Totally! I can't believe I almost didn't come tonight. Yeah, how'd you know? What? Kara broke up with you? I'm sorry,man. That sucks. Brad,do you like brunch? Yeah, I invited him to brunch. Why? Is that weird? Why can't two guys who are friends go to brunch? Girly? Breakfast isn't girly. Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly? I don't care what either of you say, I am going to the Popover Pantry with Brad. We're here. We're hungry. Get used to it, brunch. God, I love brunch. This isn't weird, right? Right? Right? Exactly. Thank you, that's exactly what I've been saying. What are you talking about? Yeah! Mamma mia!. You know what? It's supposed to be a great musical, okay? It won all sorts of Tonies and stuff. It is not a date,okay. It's just two bros taking in a Broadway show. We might grab a steak, yeah. Café l'amour. (Ted and Robin laugh) Brad says the food is really good there, okay? All right, you know what? You two are just threatened because I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' stuff. Well, guess what? It's my territory now. I'm peeing all over brunches, fancy dinners and musicals. That's right. Brad and I are taking back Broadway. I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin... (Ted and Robin laugh) Oh, you know what? Shut up. Ha,ha,ha,ha. It wasn't a date. Okay, it was a date and it got way weird. Oh, you really don't have to do that. Thanks, Brad. It gets worse. No, I can do it, Brad. Okay,thank you. You want me to go to a wedding with you? It gets worse. Vermont? Of course. I'll go to Vermont with you. Damn you,brunch! This guy's crazy, right? You're right. You're right. I promised brad I would go to the wedding with him,and then that is it. No. No... No. No! No! (On the phone) Ted. Um, Brad got me flowers. No, Brad, uh, I don't want to hear it. I do like you. And calla lilies are my favorite flower. I don't know how you knew that. I guess you just get me, but this is not cool, man. I can't believe that you would... Hi, Kara. So you guys,are like back together now? Yeah, you should have. Don't, Brad. Just don't. (He leaves) Oh my God, it's Brad. Laugh like I said something really funny. (Ted laughs) Right? Right? Oh, hey, hey, how's it going? Yeah, me too, but more important. Sure. Sure. (Brad leaves) Even if you don't believe it, tell me he looks fat."
371,2,5,robin ,"Or a stove in your bathroom? Oh! You know what? I bet sleeping at this angle is good for you. For some reason. Uh. Other cultures! I'd offer her my place, but I've got dogs and she's allergic. What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery, but it's gotta have a couch. Come on. She's desperate. Absolutely not. Oh, the Popover Pantry! That place is great. Can we go get brunch tomorrow? Oh,really? Who's this friend? Girly. Ooh, third date. You know what that means. Sounds like Brad's got quite the night planned out. You better bring your ""A"" game. That means no granny panties. Well, it could have been worse. It could have fallen in your lap. Just keep Brad away from the bouquet. And now you have to do what every dysfunctional couple has to do: Break up."
372,2,5,ted ,"Oh, wow, Lily, this is... Oh, this is all of it. Hey,is that a toilet in your kitchen? God,I hope not. Hey, cool murphy bed. Hold on, I got it. Okay, we have to get Lily out of that apartment. Her roommate is a raccoon. Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think she's a little more allergic to that. No. Well, I guess you could - well, you could try going to brunch alone. Of course, sweetie. Really? For brunch? Spare key! Brilliant! Hey, where have you been? By yourself? You invited him to brunch? Yes. That's why I was all ""you invited him to brunch?"" Because brunch is kind of... I don't know. There's nothing girly about a horse, nothing girly about a horn, but put them together and you get a unicorn. Mamma mia!? No, totally. It sounds like a really, really fun, exciting, third date. You bros going to get dinner beforehand? Where at? What are you going to wear? Hey,you're home. I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning. Woah! Okay, that's not too bad. Two single guys on the prowl. It'll be like ""Wedding crashers"". You said no, right? I'm sorry. It's not funny anymore. Look,I don't think he's crazy. I just think he's suffering from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal. And unfortunately, you're his nicotine patch. Good man. Hold on. (To Robin) Brad got him flowers. (They laugh) I'm sorry. It just got funny again. (Marshall hangs up) That was great. Yeah, I know who you are. Totally looks fat."
373,2,5,,"Ted (from 2030): Your Uncle Barney was always a bit of an enigma. In all the years we lived in new york, none of us had ever set foot in his apartment. Until one day, one of us did. Ted (from 2030): It's a pretty good story. And believe it or not, alcohol did not play a role. It all started two weeks earlier at Lily's housewarming. At Barney's apartment.Barney (on the phone): Okay,I'll take the over on the Pittsburgh game. Oh and P. to the S., I never got my payout from Seattle from two weeks ago. Yeah. Don't make me call the gaming commission on you. I'm sure they'd be very interested to know what's going on over there. All right? All right? Okay, I love you too Mom. Take care. (He hangs up) Hello Lily. You've somehow managed to circumvent my security. How did you do it? [FLASHBACK. Lily tries to spread out her bed and the wall collapses]Lily (to her Lithuanian neighbor): Sveikas (=Hello) Ted (from 2030): The next morning, as the sun rose over Manhattan, your Uncle Marshall headed over to Brad's apartment to leave for the wedding in Vermont. But when he got there... Ted (from 2030): And so Mr. and Mrs. Stinson, after two weeks of marriage, decided to call it quits. Fortunately, they reached a settlement. And that's the story of how Aunt Lily furnished her apartment. Ted (from 2030): Marshall ran into Brad again some time later."
374,2,6,all ,Probably!
375,2,6,barney ,"Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. (Marshall takes a photo of her). I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name? Really? Laid, you say? She hot? And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar. A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man. Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge. Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins. Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted. Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin. Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty? Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you. Oh, my god. Incredible. C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter! I know, I know. Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again. I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master. I think I'm falling in love with you. What? No.We had s*x yesterday. Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up. Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name. I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance. But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year. That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine. Yeah, she was. B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""! It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!"
376,2,6,client ,"That's a pen1s! We're not building a pen1s. You got any other ideas? Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here."
377,2,6,lily ,"It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion. I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper. Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap. What do you want? Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo. My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks. Thank you. So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei... What would I be doing? Oh, right, is that the...? You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s. How can he not see it? I mean there's the... And the way it... And the two little... It is just... Nice to meet you. Man, that guy is a total, well... (gestures to the building model) I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating. What design? Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers. Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed. Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him. Hey. That's easy. I took it. It's simple. Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball. Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean. Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis. I prefer to call them ""justice khakis."" So is being mean. Well, that's why I left a note. Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas. I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball. No. I mean I stand by what I did, Ted. ""Who wants espresso?"" Interesting. Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod. No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time. All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans. I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that. Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now. Congrats, ted. Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in. No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up. Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice."
378,2,6,man ,The clients are here.
379,2,6,marshall ,"Here she comes. Here she comes. I've never need the beer more than I do right now. Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid. You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s. Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah. I didn't challenge you to have s*x with... Classic. Dude, that is cold-blooded. Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there. Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor. Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar. I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus. You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it. Just let it go, man. You're making things worse. Dude, you're k*ll*ing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier. So you're going back over there? Professor Lewis, hi. Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived."
380,2,6,mr druthers," Ah.  Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?  Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?  Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?  So you're going to design the...  Once again, with feeling.  Styrofoam trees!  That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? (He leaves)  Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.  Too green.  Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?  Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!  My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.  What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.  Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.  Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.  Everybody get in here now!  Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note.  Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever ""allegedly"" did!  Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.  Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.  You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.  Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?  Excellent. Bring them in.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.  That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.  Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.  Ted, what are you doing?  Sit down, shut up right now."
381,2,6,pr lewis," Tell me what you want or get out.  Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.  Hmm... C minus.  You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.  Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.  Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.  Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.  Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.  He broke his hip.  No, he's not fine.  Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.  B plus."
382,2,6,robin ,"Her newest lifelong dream? Singing in a punk rock band. Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau. No. I'm sorry. No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams. Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday. A what? Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office? Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her. Did you show lily your design? It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia. Hey, guys. What's going on? Why? Was he being mean? Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap? I gave them to you for your birthday. To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably! Barney! Oh, my god!"
383,2,6,ted ,"What is she doing for money through all this? Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits? I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau. No. Robin, nothing to add? I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this."" What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle? Yeah. Somebody did just quit. So, where should we eat today? (looking at the assistant with a whole chicken in a container) Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? (the girl leaves, crying) It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone. It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides? So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job? Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant. You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client. Yeah. Here's the model. I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it. I know. I know. I know. Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant. I, uh... I am an architect. Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams. Absolutely. Styrofoam trees. Styrofoam trees. Styrofoam trees! He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop. No. It's nothing. Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough! Okay, I'm done. Great. Thanks. Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are. Too green? I can't un-picture it. What? What's gone? Well, it's got to be around here somewhere. Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees. Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball) Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer? Why? What does his ball have to do with anything? Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose. You know about this? So I've been walking around in stolen khakis? That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime. Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball. A note? Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with. When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball. What do you mean, no? Come on, Lily. We're running out of time. Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired. This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back. No. You'll give it back or you're fired. Then you're fired. Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily. Lily was mentally deranged. Lily was mentally deranged! Wait! We have one more idea for you. I have another design. No. Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you. Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back... What happened?"
384,2,6,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when you reach your late twenty, you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out. Like with aunt Lily. Even though she was back from San Francisco, she was still on a quest to find herself. Ted from 2030: And she did find it. Lily (coming in Robin's): I'm going to be a life coach. Ted from 2030: In fact, she found it again and again. Mr Druthers (arriving): Spectacular? Why, thank you. Barney (stepping into the office, speaking with an Italian accent): Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa... [FLASHBACK]Mr Druthers: I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef. I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university Mr Druthers (to a kid): What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream! Ted from 2030: Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest. Ted from 2030: The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day."

If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin. Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty? Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you. Oh, my god. Incredible. C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter! I know, I know. Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again. I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master. I think I'm falling in love with you. What? No.We had s*x yesterday. Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up. Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name. I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance. But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year. That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine. Yeah, she was. B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""! It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!"

388,2,7,lily ,"It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion. I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper. Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap. What do you want? Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo. My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks. Thank you. So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei... What would I be doing? Oh, right, is that the...? You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s. How can he not see it? I mean there's the... And the way it... And the two little... It is just... Nice to meet you. Man, that guy is a total, well... (gestures to the building model) I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating. What design? Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers. Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed. Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him. Hey. That's easy. I took it. It's simple. Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball. Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean. Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis. I prefer to call them ""justice khakis."" So is being mean. Well, that's why I left a note. Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas. I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball. No. I mean I stand by what I did, Ted. ""Who wants espresso?"" Interesting. Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod. No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time. All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans. I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that. Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now. Congrats, ted. Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in. No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up. Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice."
389,2,7,man ,The clients are here.
390,2,7,marshall ,"Here she comes. Here she comes. I've never need the beer more than I do right now. Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid. You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s. Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah. I didn't challenge you to have s*x with... Classic. Dude, that is cold-blooded. Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there. Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor. Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar. I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus. You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it. Just let it go, man. You're making things worse. Dude, you're k*ll*ing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier. So you're going back over there? Professor Lewis, hi. Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived."
391,2,7,mr druthers," Ah.  Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?  Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?  Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?  So you're going to design the...  Once again, with feeling.  Styrofoam trees!  That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? (He leaves)  Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.  Too green.  Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?  Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!  My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.  What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.  Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.  Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.  Everybody get in here now!  Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note.  Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever ""allegedly"" did!  Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.  Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.  You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.  Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?  Excellent. Bring them in.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.  That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.  Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.  Ted, what are you doing?  Sit down, shut up right now."
392,2,7,pr lewis," Tell me what you want or get out.  Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.  Hmm... C minus.  You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.  Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.  Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.  Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.  Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.  He broke his hip.  No, he's not fine.  Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.  B plus."
393,2,7,robin ,"Her newest lifelong dream? Singing in a punk rock band. Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau. No. I'm sorry. No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams. Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday. A what? Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office? Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her. Did you show lily your design? It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia. Hey, guys. What's going on? Why? Was he being mean? Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap? I gave them to you for your birthday. To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably! Barney! Oh, my god!"
394,2,7,ted ,"What is she doing for money through all this? Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits? I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau. No. Robin, nothing to add? I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this."" What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle? Yeah. Somebody did just quit. So, where should we eat today? (looking at the assistant with a whole chicken in a container) Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? (the girl leaves, crying) It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone. It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides? So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job? Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant. You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client. Yeah. Here's the model. I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it. I know. I know. I know. Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant. I, uh... I am an architect. Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams. Absolutely. Styrofoam trees. Styrofoam trees. Styrofoam trees! He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop. No. It's nothing. Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough! Okay, I'm done. Great. Thanks. Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are. Too green? I can't un-picture it. What? What's gone? Well, it's got to be around here somewhere. Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees. Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball) Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer? Why? What does his ball have to do with anything? Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose. You know about this? So I've been walking around in stolen khakis? That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime. Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball. A note? Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with. When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball. What do you mean, no? Come on, Lily. We're running out of time. Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired. This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back. No. You'll give it back or you're fired. Then you're fired. Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily. Lily was mentally deranged. Lily was mentally deranged! Wait! We have one more idea for you. I have another design. No. Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you. Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back... What happened?"
395,2,7,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when you reach your late twenty, you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out. Like with aunt Lily. Even though she was back from San Francisco, she was still on a quest to find herself. Ted from 2030: And she did find it. Lily (coming in Robin's): I'm going to be a life coach. Ted from 2030: In fact, she found it again and again. Mr Druthers (arriving): Spectacular? Why, thank you. Barney (stepping into the office, speaking with an Italian accent): Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa... [FLASHBACK]Mr Druthers: I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef. I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university Mr Druthers (to a kid): What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream! Ted from 2030: Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest. Ted from 2030: The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day."

397,2,8,barney ,"Hey, guys. Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine. Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell? Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done. Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend. Oh, uh, once or twice. Ah, good to see you, too. Three times, maybe. No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil. (He leaves) Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show? Marshall, I'm your best man. And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend. Of course. Unbelievable! Bright side: the bachelor party continues! Hi. See you. A... Chinese guy? Vultures. Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen. You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that bullet. They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had s*x in the closet. What? We're under oath. Yeah, we are. He's a judge. Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it. I can get us that money. Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me? Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called ""Shing Hasabu Shing"". Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money. Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it. Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm... My God, you're right. Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling! Why can't I do it just a little? Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?"
398,2,8,captain ,"I sure can. If there's two things I love, it's bringing people together in marriage and making $5,000. Okay, uh... You guys want the serious one or the funny one? You sure? I got a lot of great nautical jokes in there. Like how you two float each other's boat, stuff like that. ""We stand witness today to celebrate the union of Lily and Marshall. Today, you two will become one, sharing your lives, the happiness, the sadness, the frustrations and the joy..."" ""...to declare your love and devotion to each other in front of friends and family, all the people who matter most to you."" What was that? That little look. You two just shared a look. I now pronounce you man and wife. Is that not right? Uh... I-I suppose I could unpronounce you. All right, I unpronounce you man and wife."

401,2,8,judge ,"Turn it off. Now, normally I would say no to a request like that, but you two impress me. Just the fact that you've been together for ten years, standing by each other's side through thick and thin, never wavering. What was that? That little look. What was that? You two have stood together through thick and thin, right? All right, what was that look? What's going on?"
402,2,8,lily ,"Oh, my God. These pancakes are delicious! Oh. Do you want to cook dinner tonight? You may not have much range, but at least I'm marrying a guy who knows how to make pancakes. I mean, uhm... Well, I... I realize that we haven't really discussed whether us getting back together means us getting married, but... I still wanna. Do you still wanna? Of course, I love you. Marshall Eriksen, will you ma... What?! Do you remember your proposal to me? (She puts her hand on her eye) What do you want to hear? Marshall... You are good-looking... Funny... Smart... Okay, would you freakin' marry me already? Yeah, right. (They kiss) I can't even look Mrs. Butterworth in the eye. Oh, my God. We're getting married! Man, I made a big mess by canceling this wedding, didn't I? God, the idea of standing up there in front of all those people who hate my guts... Just makes me want to run off to Atlantic City and get married today. We're going to Atlantic City to elope. You got to come with us. I hope not because I plan on getting hammered. Ted, for the rest of our lives, we are going to be telling the amazing story of how we went to Atlantic City and got married. Don't you want to be in that story? We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now! Well, actually, I mean... It is my wedding day, and since we're here... Wow. Look at this place. I guess I'll have my pick of something old. The wedding chapel... This is it. Are you ready to do this? Oh, crap. I don't have a veil. I'm a bride, I can't get married without a veil. And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet. Oh, my God, we're getting married. Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit. Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride, you can't look better than me. I'm going to get the bouquet. You guys get the veil. We'll meet in the chapel in 20 minutes. Ready? Break. (She leaves) Oh, good. Did you get the veil? Your last lap dance ever. Hell, yeah, look at this. (She turns on her musical bouquet, playing the Wedding March) Hi. We're here to get married. No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point. Have you been outside? Is there any way that we could get a license today? Well, we're in love. Oh, really?! Oh. Well, so can we see a judge? Really?! Okay, this is a good plan B. Judges are people. People go to the bathroom. A judge is bound to come by eventually, and we'll get married. I'm sure we won't be waiting long. Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative. Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on! Okay. May we please get married today? What was what? Yeah, I mean, all... yeah. No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today. Except international waters. So let's find a ship captain. A ship captain can marry us. There's boats all over this place. This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go. (To a woman) Excuse me. Are you a ship captain? Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip, so we're getting closer. Because... If we don't do it today, I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people looking all disapproving and judging me while sipping little cups of mayonnaise and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long. No, they're not because I'm not gonna give them the chance. I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight. What? See? See, this is destiny. So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us? Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it. Do you understand what's happening? Wow. It's beautiful. Okay. Let's get this started. We don't want to do this. Yes. Because it's gonna be amazing. Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family and I didn't want to do all that work, but... Now that we're here... I realize that I have to face Marshall's family and I really want to do all that work. I love you, Marshmallow. What?! Oh, whew... That was close. Is Robin here?"
403,2,8,marshall ,"Yes! Thank you. Uhm, I learned how to cook while you were gone this summer. Yeah, sure. How about pancakes? Oh, uhm... Really? No, I mean, that's how you're gonna do it? ""Do you still wanna?"" That's like the lamest proposal ever. When I did it, I got down on my knees... I don't know, I'm just saying. No, no, no, no, no, no. You can't lead with that. You got to... build up to that. You got to have, like, a little speech. I had a speech prepared. I don't know. I mean, you could tell me, like, about how good-looking and funny and smart I am and I've been working out lately. It might be nice for you to mention something about that. Thank you. Oh, thanks. And a few tears wouldn't hurt. I'll marry you. Of course. But, uhm, until you see a ring on this finger, don't expect me to put out. I'll give you this. That was a very creative use of syrup. I know, I know. It's okay, baby. You're not just realizing that now, are you? Yeah... Robin! Stop the news! Yeah! You got it. So are you in or not? No, we got to get going to the... And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady. I'm ready. Let's get married. No, we got to go get the veil. Yeah, okay. Thanks. Great, a little nervous. Not that nervous. Oh, yeah, definitely. Barney, no. You're not my best man. You're not my best friend. Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party. I've got, like, 18 minutes. And it took us exactly 18 minutes. We went to a strip club. We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance. Right. What? Oh, baby, this is it. Let's do this thing. We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine. You guys, take it easy, guys. Are you sure about this? What better reason could there be? God, this is taking forever. Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license, but we need to skip the waiting period because... We're in love. Why are you doing this to us?! You know what? We get it. Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds. A look of love. You know, what's thick? what's thin? I have. Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen. Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license. I should go talk to her. Yeah. Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain. What? Wait, I get it. I understand this game. I totally understand the game, Theodore. Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean. Thanks, Barney. Yeah, serious is probably good. What was what? We don't. So do I. And yeah... My family might still be upset with you. But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other and none of that other stuff is gonna matter. I love you, too, Lilypad. Are... we married? Did you just marry us? Weren't you listening? We don't want to be married. Hey... Ted. Man, I hope so."

I don't know if I can just leave work. Let's go to Atlantic City! Don't worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey. Oh, really? Thanks. Done. (She leaves) Does it smell like strippers in here? Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen. Here, it looks like everyone brought their own. Can't believe they're getting married. Ted, up here. You were just staring at my shirt boobs. Really?! What? Here? Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it? Something is seriously wrong with you. All right, let's do it. Yes, I'll leave it on. No, let me. Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today? Nobody's gonna do that. Sweetie, this is crazy. You're never gonna find a ship capt... No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away. Do you think he's winning? I never said ""never."" After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?"

Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work. I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager. Of course I do. Let's go to Atlantic City! Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate? Wow. A pedicure. You been here before? You guys want to go gamble? Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one. So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life. I'm proud of you, buddy. How are you feeling? Yeah? Craps? No, I mean do you want to play craps. What did you just say? Right here. Right here. 18 minutes... Dude! Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City. That's weird, right? Marshall and Lily are getting married! Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time. There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana. Yes! Continues? You mean ""start."" He means ""start."" We went to a strip club. I know. I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through. In fact, that crazy road has led them all the way here to Atlantic City... Uhm? No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt. What the hell was that? Psst. (They move away) Yeah. Got a little time to k*ll. No. A little. So what, is that a no? All right. Um, also...? Sweet. No, we're not. Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is? Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage? Blackjack? Yeah. First guy we talked to. Ship captain. How great is that? How? Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer? Not a clue. I don't even know if he's playing. No, you don't. When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay? This is pretty cool. I can't believe you never want to get married. Are you kidding me? You guys are calling off another wedding? You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?"
407,2,8,woman ,"What the hell? It's okay, Mike can read the news tonight. (To the cameraman) Hey, Mike... You can read, right? Congratulations. We offer a variety of packages to give you the special day you've always dreamed about. Yeah. You know this isn't Vegas, right? It also takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey. The earliest I could book you for is Monday. Look, I don't know what to say, but if you guys don't want to book a wedding for Monday or play a round of keno, I can't help you. Thirty-five. Yes, they do, but they don't elope. They choose Atlantic City for its white sand beaches, world-class amenities, and exotic Riviera feel. About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Twenty-seven. You could go to the courthouse. In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be waived, but you have to have a good reason. The last one I heard was, ""I'm going to Iraq tomorrow to defend my country,"" but, you know, give yours a whirl. This is my machine."
408,2,8,woman 2," Aw. I'm gonna waive this waiting period right now.  Is what I would say if I could waive the waiting period, but unfortunately, only a judge can do that.  Absolutely.  Is what I would say if there was any chance of you seeing a judge today, which there isn't.  'Cause you're on Candid Camera!  Is what I would say..."
409,2,8,,"Ted from 2030: And so, after six months apart, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall were finally back together. Ted from 2030: And things were back to normal... Almost. Ted from 2030: It was a moment of happiness, followed of course by a moment of total panic. See, when they called off their first wedding, Aunt Lily took off for San Francisco leaving Uncle Marshall with the unfortunate task of telling his entire family. [FLASHBACK]Marshall (on the phone): Yeah, so now she's gone and the wedding's off. What do you call someone who just takes off and leaves like that? What do you call that? I think that that's a little strong. I can't even believe you would use a word like that. Geez, Grandma. Ted from 2030: So we all got a pedicure and then headed down... to Atlantic City. Barney, Ted and Robin: Yeah. Robin (arriving, wearing a ""shirt boobs""): Okay, I'm here. Right? Ted (looking at Robin's shirt): What? Ted from 2030: So we went to the courthouse. Ted from 2030: Now, I had been to a lot of casinos before that night, and I've been to a lot of casinos since, but in all that time I've never seen a game quite like this one. To this day, I have no idea how it was played. But luckily, Barney did. Both Marshall and Lily: Unpronounce us! Unpronounce us! Ted from 2030: And that's the story of how Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily got married for 12 seconds somewhere off the coast of Atlantic City. Ted (wearing Robin's shirt boobs): Hey, guys."
410,2,9,barney ,"Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either. Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email? Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are. Come on, let's go. To the Willowbrook Mall! Why not? Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment. Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker. Oh. Oh. Oh. So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible. You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox. I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton? Bill's bachelor party in Memphis. OK, Seattle. Damn. Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is? Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p*rn, wait for it, ography. They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess. Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it. 'Cause it's p*rn. 20,000 says it's p*rn. Well then, what do you have? I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet. Your hand is monstrous. I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress. Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of p*rn from Canada I have to go through. Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong. Canadian p*rn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go ""oat"" of my mind. You, you got something to say to me? Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk. Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall: No. You're gonna cry. So I just got a very interesting phone call. I know Robin's secret. That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now. Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this. What? Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now! Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing. Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right. Yeah you were. They never do. It always does. Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock. I'm gonna go with the five for eternity. Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin: I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket. Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin: Yes."
411,2,9,future ted vo,...learn about relationships is that you're never done getting to know someone.  Some aren't as nice.  And some are just weird.
412,2,9,lily ,"We can split a cinnabun. Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets. Try me. Doggie ate his pants. Yep. Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach? Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch. What happened next? I don't know, he could be right. She does have the fake orgasm noises down. What? The walls are thin. We're not getting married at the mall. No, because before Robin moved to New York, she...What was she doing? Except when she's talking about... What do you think of this wedding cake? No. No. What the hell's a slap bet? Are you really gonna do that? That's so immature. Marshall: You can be Slap Bet Commissioner. Oh, I love it. What are my powers? You said you would respect her privacy so maybe you should just drop it. I can't believe you told us Robin's secret. No I didn't. Please tell us, just tell us. I'm begging you. Tell us, tell us, tell us, please, please, please, please, please. Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us. I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you? Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage. It's like their money or their army. Nobody takes it seriously. Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch p*rn. Barney gets three slaps. One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps. Are you as terrified as I am? This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. And yet a slap occurred without the permission of the Slap Bet Commissioner. OK, I'm going to give you a choice. Either ten slaps right now in a row or five slaps that can be doled at any point from here to eternity. So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?"
413,2,9,marshall ,"The 'oh' moment? I'm not afraid of Sasquatch. I just think we should all be on alert. So, after the shower, I was brushing my teeth, and I was like, oh man, I wanted to have some orange juice, I should have done that first, but I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush so I just went ahead and brushed them anyway. You know what it might be. This is gonna sound a little crazy but what if robin's married? Well, maybe she got married at the mall. Back home in Minnesota a ton of people would get married at the Mall of America, it's great. It's a gorgeous indoor golf course for pictures. Numerous fine dining options, and talk about a reasonable price... Just meet with the guy. Because she already got married, at the mall. She's a pretty private person. Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted. Robin is not in p*rn. I'll bet you anything that she's married. I don't have 20,000. Well. Whoever's right gets to slap the other person in the face as hard as they possibly can, but no rings. Um, if a problem arises and we need a ruling, that's your job. Barney: But you have to be unbiased and put the integrity of slap bet above all else. This is an honor you will take with you to your grave. On your tombstone, it will read ""Lily Aldrin, caring wife, loving friend, Slap Bet Commissioner."" And your tombstone will read, ""got slapped by Marshall so hard, he died."" Well, what did you expect? You've seen my pen1s. Ha ha ha. You know what, in some countries, if you've been separated for longer than five years, technicall, you're no longer married. I can check it out at the law library at school. I can see my hand print on your face. I won the bet. Why are you still searching? Hey. Listen, dude, I gotta talk to you, but you gotta promise me that you won't tell Barney. Robin's not married. I don't know but I cross-checked every record in Canada. There's no record of her ever being married. I promise you, she's not married. She's not great at parking legally either. You gotta lawyer her. You gotta ask her a bunch of questions, try to trip her up, maybe make her feel guilty, whatever it takes to get a confession out of her. What are you talking about? Barney: I know Robin was never really married. How could you possibly know that? Uh, let's see. Uh, first, I took the subway to school, and I got a bagel. Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married. Crazy. And then I was hungry again so I went down to the vending machine... You told him? Lily: I had to. I'm Slap Bet Commissioner. Baby, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you. Three? I don't wanna get slapped again. That's you? This is the 90's. Why does it look like 1986? Taking a break from the first of many viewings, I can't help but notice that this isn't p*rn. Looks like someone suffered from premature slapulation Relax, dude, I'm just going for my soda, man. Take it easy. This is gonna be fun. That's one. The robot! Hey!"
414,2,9,priest ,I now pronounce you man and wife.
415,2,9,robin ,"And then there was Derek and counting you, that puts the total up to... Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners? Why? No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt. All right, I'm in. Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going. I just don't feel like going to a mall. No, I'm really not gonna go. No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls. I'd rather not say. Thanks Ted. You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to. No. Ted. Let it go. Let it go. And who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Ted: Not me in Ohio when I was nine, that's for sure. I used to be a dude. A friend of mine in Canada got married way too young and it really turned her off to marriage. Oh, I like it. Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada who got married too young? Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Field's giant cookie. My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French. There's no 'p' in husband. Huh. Are you asking me if I'm married? Ted: You can ask me. Nope, I'm not married. Your turn. What happened to respecting my privacy? Ted: Just say, ""no, I'm not married."" Ted, I don't understand why you can't... I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married. He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough. I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this. Thanks Ted. I say we just move on. Um... No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc. String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound. Dusty rose and sienna. Um. Yes I was. How do you know? What library? When did you go? I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use? You told Marshall? See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret. Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too. Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world? Yeah, but it could have been. He moved there for business. I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine. What? Barney, don't, okay. No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it. I wanna stress that I was young. And I didn't know any better. And it started out as an innocent modeling job. What the hell was that? p*rn? I wish it was p*rn, it would be less embarrassing. I was a teenage pop star in Canada. Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels. The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93. No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5? Good call. You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice."

Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls. If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to. I think we should all just respect her privacy. So, what's the deal with you and malls? Yeah, with those people. I'm your boyfriend. Come on, what is it? Did you get arrested in a mall? Dumped in a mall? Found out you were Canadian at a mall? Trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Robin: Let it go. Mauled at the mall? What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls? I disagree. If there's some potential 'oh' moment, I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative? I love you. It's true. They tell each other everything. Trust me, not only do they tell each other everything. They want to know everything. You know? Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous. Hey. That's not what I'm hey-ing you about. Married? What does have to do with the mall? She's not married. Robin hates marriage. Well, I don't know, whenever I ask her about Canada, she kinda clams up. So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada? Thank you Barney. I need another beer. Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid. All right, what if I ask Robin point-blank if she has a husband? Yeah, you're right. Husband. Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands. Fine, I'll take it back. Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada. I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that? Just say, ""no, I'm not married."" Oh. You have a husband? Robin: I was young and stupid and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall and I haven't been to a mall since. Why didn't you get divorced? Good... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough. OK. How can I keep something like that to myself? And you begged me to tell you. Fine, Robin's married. See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it? What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce? It's serious to me. Hey. Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it? What? Then, why would she tell me she was? There must be some mistake. So, she lied to me? What, what am I gonna do? I can't confront her 'cause then she'll know I told you. Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest. Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is. In order for me to get total closure on this whole my-girlfriend-has-a-husband thing, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more information. Like, what month did you get married? Robin: June. We had a June wedding. Ah, Canada in June. That's great. Sit down or buffet. Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember. Hm. Band of DJ? How many bridesmaids? Robin: Seven. Flowers? Robin: Azaleas. Color scheme? Husband's name? You were never married. No you weren't. I looked it up at the library. The one on 5th. Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad.... I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000. You lied to me! But it was a fake secret. Testing me, that's insane. That wasn't a real secret. You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong. I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced. What are you talking about? Yeah. No I don't. Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret. No, Barney, I said we're not watching this. Oh my God. I slap bet Marshall that you did p*rn, so I win. Oh my God, Robin's rapping. Guys, Robin's rapping. Go with the 10 now. Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy. Horrible call. Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone. No, she doesn't wanna wait."

If gay guys start getting married, then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it. That's how it works. They start something, then six months later, everyone follows. Like now everyone gets manicures. Okay, then like how... Like getting your chest waxed. You know what I mean! Gay marriage is going to cause single life, as we know it, to die out.

So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone, and once he's in a funner mood... Oh, so now it's my way of life? I thought it was our way of life. You've completely turned your back on it. Look at you, not even suited up. Do you remember why we suit up, James? To show people that we are different from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there. The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with, a two-person army that plays by its own rules. But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines, and you've abandoned me. Well, I'm not gonna let you do that. It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing! You don't have to do this, bro! - Why?! What? There's gonna be a baby? Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle? To James and Tom. May you have a long and happy life together.

I just got finished running from some fat, hairy guy who was periscoping out of his pleather pants. Permission to come aboard denied. Oh, no thanks. I've had enough. He's too in shape, we'd spend all night talking about his body fat content. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go have a yummy, pink drink with fruit in it... because I can. Hey, bro. Why? No, it's just a phone. It's just a phone! And it's got Internet access, and it's got a camera on it, and you can surf the Web and do the whole thing. It's so amazing how far technology has come. What kind of phone do you have? That is Tom. And he's my fiancé. Hey. Gay marriage? Believe me, I fought this for a long time. Come on, it's embarrassing. Look, this felt unnatural to me, too, at first. But I fell in love. And Tom and I realized you can't fight love. Okay, okay, look,I need you to wrap your head around this, okay? Because it is happening. And I want you to be my best man. Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. I hope you change your mind. Yeah. This is where we're celebrating the commitment that Tom and I are about to make?  And then Tom says to the dealer that the handmade Georgian clock has a chip on the corner. Blam, we get that puppy half price. What up?! Bam! Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Hey, oh, my God. This is so liberating, being able to talk about this to you. I cannot wait for you to meet Tom. Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you, Barnaby. Okay. All right. I spy a group of women who have let their defenses down because they are in a gay club. You see that chick right there? She looks like she'd fall for sports agent and football player. Please. Barney. Barney, Barney, I don't want his number. I don't want anyone's number, okay? I'm getting married. - Thank you. Okay, okay, excuse me. Barney, family talk. Okay, dude, you have got to stop this, okay? I know that my getting married is threatening to your way of life... To get laid. - Yes, I do. Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby. Yes. We're adopting. For the rest of your life. - Yeah."
424,2,10,james and barney, Have you met my brother?
425,2,10,lily ,"He's exactly like Barney. Anyway, James, how have you been? And then there was the time they scored the brother/sister combo. - Jammies. I miss my jammies. I can't believe I wore a bra for this. Yeah, they're like a boobie zoo. Oh, please go sweat on someone else. Poor guy? Poor my boobs. Oh, yeah, yeah. He looks all broken up inside. You know, that was, like, the third hot guy that James blew off tonight. This is gonna k*ll Barney. Oh, sweetie! Did you make that for me? You get your chest waxed? No, it isn't.  - And not be groped! Looks like the boys learned their lesson. Do you totally miss being hit on? It was perfect. You even made Tom's dad cry. Might have been doing that because he's a Republican. Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat."
426,2,10,man ,"Oh, my God, I do! Well, why don't you take it off then and let those puppies breathe? Excuse me. Join me in a shot? Hey. You work out? Well, I try. So you want to dance? I'm sorry. You know, I saw your drink and I... Whatever. How 'bout you? Hey, I really like your sweater. My name's Gay Ken, what do you think? Look at me, in a yummy sandwich! Ooh, I know what I want to be in the middle of. Thoughts?"
427,2,10,marshall ,"Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye. Yeah, so now the wedding's back on. Last time James was in town, Barney got slapped once, lucky twice, and... whose penthouse hot tub did you end up in? Tonight? It's after 9:00 and...I have warm soup belly. Poor guy. Well, it takes a lot of guts to approach a girl and you just crushed him. ""Oh, poor me. I get to order yummy, pink drinks with chunks of real fruit that guys secretly like, but can't order because they'll be made fun of."" - They're delicious! Yeah, he's turning down shots, he's yawning, he's whining about his feet. He's as bad as we are. Look at that. He's texting! B-Barney? Have you noticed anything...different about James? Yes. Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up and be a man about this. Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change. Oh, my God. Freedom has never tasted so delicious. I do. And thank you for noticing. You're obviously in very good shape yourself. You know what? I'm very flattered, and, objectively, you're a very attractive man, but this is actually my fiancée. No, no, this isn't my drink. This is hers. You see that? Being hit on doesn't have to be terrible. I feel flattered, and everyone left with their dignity. - We're hot. I just never thought I'd see Barney so vulnerable. Okay, we're actually right in the middle of something right now, so... That's like the eighth guy who's hit on us in ten minutes. It's like, hello, Whoa. It's 9:00. We should be getting back. You guys want to split a cab? All right, well, it's getting late. Got to get the wife home."
428,2,10,mere ,"Well, boys, you look different because when I was pregnant with you, I only ate vanilla ice cream. And when I was pregnant with you, can you guess what kind of ice cream I ate? - No, James, I ate chocolate ice cream. But I did drink tons of coffee when I was pregnant with both of you. Can't smoke without my coffee. I don't know, boys, I guess it's just one of those things. Stop asking me! You know what you two are? You're little racists!"
429,2,10,robin ,"- No. - You have a brother? Really? I never in a million years would I picture you with a gay brother, that's awesome. Thanks for the heads up. How in God's name did it never come up that Barney has a gay, black brother? - Hey. It's so nice to meet you. So, I have to ask, there's a story here. Bras suck. They're so confining and unnatural. Whatever, you guys have no idea what it's like to be on the receiving end. No. There's no way. He's Barney's brother. And, Barney... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... he's texting. Wow. You actually do, don't you? You're not checking out my boobs or anything. I love this place! Let's dance! - Whoo! Thank you. How's it going, guys? Still enjoying the attentions of men? Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar. Yeah, me, too. I'm not tired at all."
430,2,10,rosa ,I don't get it. Tom liked my breasts in tenth grade. Why doesn't he like them now? Why?
431,2,10,ted ,"- Nope. - Nope. It got so bad, Barney tried to be his own wingman. Finally, he decided to bring in reinforcements. Well, Barney and his brother aren't exactly alike. James is gay. Yeah. I just wanted you to have a heads up, so you don't act all surprised when he gets here. Is he black? I guess I'm the kind of person that focuses on who people are on the inside rather than the color of their skin. I'm kidding, I just wanted to see your face. Oh, James, this is my girlfriend, Robin. The truth is, Barney and James got a lot of... different explanations from their mom over the years. So what are you guys gonna do tonight? Okay. And Barney always returned the favor. - No. So that night, Barney got his wish. We all went out. Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy, crowded bar, you can always tell the difference between the singles and the couples. You just have to look for the signs. Singles stay on their feet for maneuverability. Couples, exhausted by the sheer act of leaving the house, are obsessed with finding a place to sit down. There are a lot of other indicators, too. From choice of social lubricant...to basic body language. But the point is, there are many ways to tell whether someone has Single Stamina or Couples Coma. ""Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl and everybody everywhere wants to buy me drinks and have s*x with me."" Waa. - Dude. He is. Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are. You guys don't think that James is... in a relationship? Oh, my God! He is in a couple. We have reason to believe that James is, uh, maybe hiding something from you. I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but... Barney... your brother is...monogamous. I don't get manicures. Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like. Sandals and socks--come on, buddy. But I took her out, we celebrated. It was the right thing to do. You got to support him. Oh, I'm straight, too. But I thank you for your time, and I appreciate your interest in my body. - Thank you! - Totally. Well, I guess no one wants to feel like they're going through the world alone. God, can't two straight guys come to a gay dance club, enjoy some techno and good conversation without being bothered? And it's never the hot ones. It's always the losers. Bums me out! Uh, no, I think I'm gonna stay a little bit longer."
432,2,10,tes ,"Yeah, Barney and James together was a lethal combination. Since there was never any crossover in targets, James was always there for Barney with the assist."
433,2,10,tous ,"- No. - Hey! - Hell, yeah! - Hell, yeah! - Woo-woo! Yes! - Cheers."
434,2,10,woman ,"Two beers, one shot."
435,2,10,women ,"Thanks. H & M. - Get off me, you pig! Thanks. You should stay close... just in case."
436,2,10,,"Ted (V.O.): Kids, there's nothing more wonderful than New York City in the winter... except the view of New York City in the winter through your apartment window.In the winter of 2006, Marshall, Lily, Robin and I were all deep in couple hibernation mode. Sadly, this left Uncle Barney out in the cold. Marshall, lily, Robin: - No, thanks."
437,2,11,a kid, Like the gift of God's love?
438,2,11,barney ,"She'd give it up for a bad pun. I'm telling you, she's a laugh slut. And her art? ""I'm Lily, I'm an artist."" She doesn't even own a beret. Then why don't you say it now? Perfectly. Ted Vivian Mosby! Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? I don't kiss your mother with my mouth. Yet. (Barney sneezes) Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy? I'm fine. I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome and I had to get some of it out. Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time when people are lonely and desperate. It's the most wonderful time of the year. I don't see any mistletoe, but... (He sneezes on her) Uh... ""Bless you"" would have been nice. I'm not sick. You know what? I am sick. Sick of you telling me I'm sick. What up? Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive ""no cigars in the apartment rule."" God, it's like Marshall's marrying the Taliban. (he sneezes on his hand). High five. Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north, let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body. You see, whenever I start feeling sick, I just stop being sick and be awesome instead. True story. Yeah, in two minutes, I'm going to pound a sixer of Red Bull, hop in a cab, play a couple of hours of laser tag, maybe get a spray-on tan. It's gonna be legen... Wait for it... (Barney falls asleep) This is a low moment for the Barnacle. I should be off playing laser tag right now, but instead... Don't look at me. I'm hideous. Exactly. I'm a Ted. I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants. Yes. Too weak... to hold... bowl. Ouchie in my mouth! I don't want it. I want ice cream. But my throat hurts. I hate you! Don't leave me."
439,2,11,both kids," Grinch, Grinch, Grinch..."
440,2,11,charity ,"Yay! Why don't you recite your favorite passage of scripture. Dear, Father, thank you for this day, and thank you for bringing this family together. Amen."
441,2,11,clint ,"Hey, buddy, it's Clint. How you doing, champ? Hey, hey, no, no, no. Ted, Ted. You don't know this yet, but you and I are going to be great friends. Now, the Native Americans have this ritual..."
442,2,11,his mother, Ted Evelyn Mosby!  I just got the most disturbing call from Lily. How could you use such a horrible word?  Are you acting out because of the divorce? Is-is this all about Clint?
443,2,11,kid ,"Uncle Ted got us presents! Mom, what's a Grinch?"
444,2,11,lily ,"Yes. Hey, look. Our old answering machine. Thanks. Oh, hey, look, there's still some messages on here. I'm... a what? That was you, Ted. Marshall left a message for Marshall? Why would you call me that? The best friend's job is to call me that word? Are you seriously not going to apologize for leaving that message? Why not? Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby. Merry Christmas, assface. At my apartment. Ted, do you know what I would do if one of my kindergartners used that kind of language? I would be on the phone with their parents. Exactly. You know what that word means. You know that calling people names is mean and hurtful... assface. Don't forget to take the cookies out of the oven... assface! Who is this? Hey, you tricked me. No, I knew it was you. I just thought you'd at least bring a pizza. No, I'm not spending Christmas with you. Oh, shut up. You think I don't know your fake apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh? You're clearly still mad at me. Yes, you are. I've apologized to Marshall and he's forgiven me and we've moved passed it. Why can't you? Yeah, some friend, you called me a Grinch. How can you... Happy? Now, you've pissed off the big guy upstairs. That's my super. He lives above me. Great. Thanks to your filthy mouth, now I'm going to have Christmas alone in the dark. Merry Christmas! What's in the box? I thought you were writing a paper. Okay. Oh, my God. An Easy Bake Oven! I've wanted one of these ever since I was a little girl. In this exact model. I never told you that. How did you know? When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven. I begged and I begged, but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles. I can't believe Ted remembered after all these years. Staten Island. I came here to apologize. I'm so sorry, Ted. Are you coming home? Oh, for the love of God, are you as sick of apologies as I am? Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving? That's okay. I was kind of a Grinch."
445,2,11,marshall ,"Okay, I have one last paper due at 5:00 p.m. today, so until then, I will be at the law library at school, but I'm not to be disturbed for any reason. No, no. Christmas Eve winter wonderland is my reward for finishing my paper. Baby, do I smell your Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies? Damn me and my heightened other senses. Must be strong. Okay, I'll be back here at 5:00. Save me at least 20 cookies and do not clean the bowl. Was that a reindeer? I don't want to know! She was perfect. I lost the perfect woman. I should have knocked her up when I had the chance. There's only one of her? Fiercely independent? Brave? I guess it was a little selfish. Yeah. No, you're right. Lily would laugh at anything. Yeah, and if she's such a great ""artist,"" why does she suck at Pictionary? Who draws a ninja star like a Star of David? Right, right? Another round! Screw the paper, how's the winter wonderland? Is it magical? When you walk through the door, does it feel like you've been slapped in the face by Christmas? Come on, man, describe it! Tell me about the decorations. Is Rudolph there? He is, isn't he? Hi, Rudolph! Hell, yeah! What else would it be about? Yeah, well, all I know is walking in that door and seeing the winter wonderland and seeing Lily and all you guys, just... I can't wait. Right. Okay.Oh, wait. Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted. One more thing. How about the cookies? Are they delicious? Well, tell Lily I love her. Holy crap, the magical Christmas season is upon us. And thank God we don't pay for utilities. Only the best present for the best girl ever. It took me all day to track it down. Ah, naw, I blew that off. I'll get an extension. School's not important. What is that pitter patter on the roof? Could it be the sound of an awesome Christmas story about to come down the chimney? Why, yes, it is. 'Twas the day before Christmas... It was supposed to arrive, like, five days ago, but then it got lost and rerouted. I checked two other branches, finally they told me it was here. What?No, no, no, no,I need that package today. Stop! Stop! Stop, please, stop. Stop. Stop the truck. I need a package on your truck. Can I please take a look in back? I'm okay. (out of the truck) Hey, man, thanks for helping me make my fiancee's Christmas. Wait, so some people aren't going to get their gifts in time for Christmas? We delivered every single package on that truck. But I still have one package left to give. Yeah, I did. Merry Christmas. Open it, Baby. It's our first Christmas since we got back together. I want to get her something really special. So I'm getting her a jukebox. Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum. I couldn't find the outside. Yeah, and after all that weed. Where is he anyway? Why? Merry Christmas, Marshall."
446,2,11,robin ,"Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy boy. Well, at least you apologized. You apologized, didn't you? Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses? If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays. You're sick. You're sick. You sure this is gonna work? Totally. Plus free mug. Barney! What the hell are you doing? Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane? Eww. No. You have to go home and get to bed. She's just mad. She'll cool down. Where are you going? You just look like a regular guy. And isn't it more comfy? Come on, you need eat something. Fine, I'll feed you. No, you're not having ice cream for dinner just 'cause you're sick. No! You're spending Christmas Eve with your family? Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry. Well, do you want me to go with you? First tell me your answer. You mean the whiney bottomless pit of neediness? He was bugging me, so I spiked his echinacea tea with codeine."
447,2,11,stacy ,"That's okay, Ted, we'll just give them to charity. Uh, not you, Charity. I meant the less fortunate. Ted, how would you like to say grace tonight? Who is it, Ted?"
448,2,11,ted ,"Dude, open your eyes. You're going to hurt yourself. Oh, yeah. After you left, we, uh, we unplugged it because it reminded Marshall of how you used to, you know, leave messages. But hey, you guys are back together. I say we're plugging it back in. It's good to have you back. Yes, same Clint. But I didn't say ""Grinch."" I said a bad word. A very, very bad word. Oh, fudge. But I didn't say fudge. I-- That was Barney, that was Barney. That was Marshall. You know, it may have been me, but it was so long ago. Man, that machine, it really garbles your voice.You know, it almost made it sound like I said... It was a fair question. Marshall's breakup with Lily had sent him into a deep depression and nothing could get him out of it. Until one day... Okay. That's it. You're never going to get over her until you stop putting her on a pedestal. So no more ice cream until you tell me one thing that's wrong with Lily. Okay. She called off your wedding and dumped you to be a painter in San Francisco. What do you call that? There you go. And in almost no time, that spark turned into a roaring fire. Remember that time we heard her laughing and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's, but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2? Yeah! I was trying to help him. I'm his best friend. That's the best friend's job. Yeah. Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word. Grinch. You timed that didn't you? Oh, yeah. ""I'm sorry"" were the first words out of my mouth. I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing. I was just trying to put the guy back together. You smashed him to pieces. No! Because, Lily, this summer, you were kind of a Grinch. That's not my middle name. Like you've never said that word. Are you sick? No, I meant do you have a cold? I should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve. Ahh... Three flights of stairs, not a drop spilled. Hey, buddy. Yeah, this is our thing. In college, whenever I wanted to make up with her, I'd buy her a beer. Cute, right? Usually that would've done the trick, but it turned out this was a problem not even alcohol could solve. Actually the beer helped a little. She took the decorations. She took the decorations! What a Grinch! That time I did say ""Grinch."" All right. I guess I have to call her, right? Lily's cell phone. She'll listen to reason-- right? Oh, hey, Billy. Actually, funny thing--the voice dial got you. I was trying to call... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. (20 minutes later) Yeah, the holidays are a rough time for everyone, Billy. Okay, yeah, dinner next Wednesday. Okay. Damn voice dial. Lily! Um, Lily? Where are the Christmas decorations? You want to bring them back so we can celebrate Christmas together-- please? Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner. Lily, if you don't bring that stuff back right now, we... Lily... Damn it! I could be in Cleveland right now making peppermint lager with my dad. Marshall gets home in three hours. He's gonna show up--no Lily, no winter wonderland.I gotta get up to the Bronx. Hey, dude, how's the paper going? Oh... so magical. Sure does. Look, I gotta go. Ah, yeah, but, you know... decorations, is that really what Christmas is about? Uh, try the birth of Christ. You know, Christmas-- Christ Mas, which means ""More Christ"" to our Spanish friends. Right. I gotta go. You know, honestly, they taste a little store-bought. Oh! I got another call.  Right. (he hangs up end takes the other call)- Hello? Oh. Uh, hey, Mom. Merry Christmas. Oh, God, she called you? No, Mom, why would it be about Clint? Hey, Clint. Listen, um, I don't really have time to... Pizza delivery. You really thought I was the pizza delivery guy? Yeah, well, I brought a beer, but I gave it to a homeless guy. All right, he took it from me. Now, will you please come home? Okay, I'm sorry for calling you a... that word, over the summer, and for saying it again today. And for thinking it a lot on the subway ride over. I had no right to say that. It was hurtful and immature and I'm sorry. I'm not mad at you. I am not mad at you, Lily. Now, can we please just... Because you never apologized to me. Marshall's not the only one you walked out on. You leave for three months, you don't even call. Come on, Lily, we're supposed to be friends! You were a Grinch! Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch. Yeah, I'm sure God cares if I... Fine. I don't want to ruin Christmas. You can have the apartment. Don't worry about seeing me there I'll be in Staten Island with my cousin Stacy. Just.... Merry Christmas. Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird. You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees. And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name when he wants to trick us. Was that a sincere offer? Stay there. Save yourself. We'll spend all day together tomorrow. Okay. Oh, how's Barney feeling? You're gonna be a great mom. Wow, that's a great gift. Oh, man, I know something you could get her that would blow her mind. Ready? Eight years ago... Easy Bake Oven--that's what I'm going to call my van. Dude... how was the concert? Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents. No, dude, real presents. Uh, you know what, why don't you say it. I really wouldn't know what to say. That's a great idea, Charity. But, really, I don't know. I mean how do you choose your favorite passage? It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones... That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool. Doorbell rings. Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in. Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers. Marshall starts singing. Robin and Barney follow. I accept. Give me the beer. it is so good to see you guys. Totally. But first, Lily, I owe you an apology. Yes Yes. And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again. Nothing. It's something you shouldn't say. Merry Christmas, everybody. Ted takes his coat and leaves (to his friends) Run, run."

455,2,11,,"Ted (V.O.): Kids, as you know, Christmas is a time you spend with your family. So in December of 2006, I had three options. Spend it with my mom and her new boyfriend Clint, spend it with my dad and his new girlfriend micro-brewing, or head down to Staten Island to spend it with my super religious cousin Stacy and her family. So I opted for none of the above and decided to spend Christmas 2006 in Manhattan... celebrating with my other family. Ted (voix dans le répondeur): Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the couch right now moping about Lily? You are, aren't you? Well, stop it. She's not worth it. You gotta get over that Grinch. Barney:...dary."

457,2,12,barney ,"I left something in the hallway. Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway. No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have s*x, you exit when she's in the shower. The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars. Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, ""Are we there yet?"" Discouraging premarital s*x is against my religion. s*x is fun. I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary. Good one, Ted. I was, uh, six... fourt... How old were you again? Dude, me, too. Yeah, of course. What, you don't believe me? - It was at camp, so I'm... This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer. Uh, dance. Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby. Sylvia How you call your loverboy? And if he doesn't answer And if he still doesn't answer? Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot. Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water? Who's Scooter? No, Marshall, they say, (with a sad voice) ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other."" What are you talking about? We were here yesterday. They've only had s*x with each other. Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout... I mean, I was in a subway with a high-priced call girl... I was accidentally hacking into NORAD'S computer... All right! I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda. She called me ""Barry"" the whole time, and for two weeks, my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy? Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's. Her dad did not approve of our love. Oh, God, no. What can I say, I... had... the time of my life. True story."

You were only 16 when you lost yours. Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now. It's like forever. I mean, we've already done everything else. I mean, we've even... You have no right to tell me not to do it. Robin, this is happening. Look, I already put it up on my Myspace page. I need a clove. Know what? I don't want to see the stupid Empire State Building anymore. I'm going to see Kyle. Oh, please, you've had s*x with, like, a hundred guys. I'm sure you were madly in love with all of them. Really. Well, do you love Ted? Do you love Ted? Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay. Hey. Got another Empire State Building fun fact for me? I don't know what everyone is freaking out about. Kyle, he's a really nice guy. He could've cheated on me with my lab partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't. 'Cause he said he knew I'd find out. Oh, really? So I told Kyle I wanted to wait... and he dumped me. Only if you put a buttload of Kahlua in it."
462,2,12,kyle ,"Looks like hotness runs in the family. Yeah. My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad, but he buys me beer, so... Hot."
463,2,12,lily ,"Falafel? Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said ""falafel""? I just don't get it. Why can't you tell Ted you love him? Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before. No. Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory. Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall. Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing. Aw, your sister's so cute. Hello, Kitty. It's 2:00 and you've already had three scotch and sodas. Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either. But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancee. Oh, remember cloves? Barney, you okay? That's Dirty Dancing. Do you remember our first time? Oh, wait, wait. Look... I really want to do this, but... we should make it special, you know? Do this right. Yeah, New Year's Eve. Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music. Why not? Oh, yeah, that sounds so good. Oh, I love you, Marshall. I'm so glad we're waiting. (12 minutes later): Oops. End of flashback. Yeah. Want to do it again? The point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be. Wait, I've never heard your story. I'm so sorry. What do you mean just barely?  Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story. My high school boyfriend, who I did not have s*x with. Marshall, why is this such a big deal? Okay, Marshall, I get it. No, it doesn't. Look, have you been to the Empire State Building? No. You've only been in the lobby. People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby. They buy tickets to get to the top. Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count. Exactly! So yesterday doesn't count as having gone to the Empire State Building. So I lost it to you, Marshall. And I rode that elevator to the top, and I saw that view, and I basked in the awesomeness. And that's our story. We've only had s*x with each other. Speaking of first times, we never got to hear your virginity story."
464,2,12,man ,"Thank you, man. I was going up there to jump. (the man hugs Ted) You're right. Why would I throw that all away? I'm having the best day!"
465,2,12,marshall ,"Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus. Speech to talk a girl out of having s*x. Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school. It's totally cool to wait. And stay away from drugs... other than pot. Even Kyle gets to do that. No! We were 18. What camp? No, it was two nights ago. ""She's Like the Wind"" has been stuck in my brain for about 40 hours. I just got it out. Now it's back in. Damn you, Swayze! Yeah. It was back in college. Okay. You're right. Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend. Okay. That's not a good idea. Long story. But maybe we could put on some Al Green and take a bubble bath together. That was amazing. We said we were sorry. You know what, I loaned you my Walkman. Yes, it does. No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter? I... I can't believe this. We're Marshall and Lily, when people see us, they say, ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other."" But now that's not true anymore, now you've had s*x with twice as many people as I have. I knew that you were too good at it. Why is this such a big deal? Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus, guess who actually discovered the New World. Some dude named Scooter. Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong, it actually goes like this: ""One small step for man, one giant leap for Scooter."" Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve before you did... It's a big deal because it rewrites our history. Really. Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building? Thank you, sir. You're a very wise and brilliant man. Yeah, but that didn't really count. Oh, crap. Yeah. Yeah, that's our story. We've only had s*x with each other. Well, we're usually busy... drinking. That's right, I almost forgot. Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills."
466,2,12,molly ,"I love you, Ted. That was amazing. Where are you going? Well, will you call me? Yeah? Oh, I love you, too, Ted.  Look, I got to go. Uh, my cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going into the woods to light them. It's gonna be awesome. Yeah. I'll totally call you. Oh, Ted? Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back."
467,2,12,robin ,"What?! Spider! Spider! Right there. Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick. Good night. Wait, Ted? Good night. Well, great, I'll see you then. Bye, sweetie. (To Ted) Hey. Guess what? My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend. She gets in on Thursday. Really? You'd do that? Ted. Falafel. Falafel. I totally choked. Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me. Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit. So every girl you have s*x with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that. So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit. It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it. Oh, here comes Katie. Yeah. This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school, with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack. Oh, no. No. No. No. Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person? Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...? That's cool. This is my friend Lily. You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled. Uh, no, you're not. What? Oh. Oh...  I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a......douche with a faux hawk. This can't happen. You guys have to help me talk her out of it. Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions. That's why I need your help. You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special. Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys? See? Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room. Oh. La, la, la, la, la.La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la, la, la, la. But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted. You smoke now, too? No ""Aw, remember cloves?"" This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having s*x. What did you teach? Oh, that's adorable. Well, mine was terrible. Well, as you know, I was 16. And it was with my boyfriend Brian. Yeah. Oh, I know. Oh, Brian. Eh, I should've known. There were signs. What?! Oh, my God! You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had s*x, it counts. Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end. Yes, it does. Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once. You should only be having s*x with someone who's special. It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys. I had different levels of feeling for each of the... very reasonable number of guys. I, um... Just let me explain. Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying... ""hm hm hm"" is like... getting into the carpool lane. And I don't want to take an exit, but... at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane. Because what's in the carpool lane? Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get... It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon. No. I didn't... Yeah, like you did. I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird. Pretty sure weird. I mean, who gives it up on the first date? No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut. You... What? You can't take it back. Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place to lecture you on romantic relationships, but... but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made. That's not what I meant. I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up. Please don't do this. Hey. She didn't do it. No, I didn't. You did. She told me that you talked to her. Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Aw, honey. I promise everything is gonna be okay. You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo? Don't tell Mom. Thanks for doing that. But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you. Oh, come here. I love you. I said it. Feels right. I love you. Yeah. I guess I was just waiting for the right guy."
468,2,12,sylvia ,"Yes, Mickey? Come here, loverboy Oh, loverboy I simply say, baby... Oh, baby. My sweet baby"
469,2,12,ted ,"I think I'm in love with you. Well, here's the thing, normal people, you know, people who aren't your dad, usually take longer to say ""I love you."" Robin went through the usual stages. Where? Got it. First there's the moment when you think you think it. Whoa, still alive. There's the moment you think you know it. Totally worth it. There's the moment where you know you know it, but you can't yet say it. All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow? Good night. Yeah? That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building. Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building. And then there's the moment where you know you know it, and you can't keep it in any longer. Yeah? What? Yeah, I don't have any of those. Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night. And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building. You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun Come on, you were only 16 when you had s*x. I was 17. Barney was probably 12. 17. Dance? It was on last night. Yeah, tell her what happened next. Please don't. End of flashback. Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again? It's not stupid. Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 22: The Empire State Building has tons of places where people can have private conversations. ( goes away with Robin) You're off the hook, okay? You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine. Okay, Robin, Robin, stop. It's no big deal, you don't have to say it. What, you mean like I did? Weird... or courageous? Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight. Well, then you're an I-love-you prude. You know what? I take mine back. I take my ""I love you"" back. Nah. Just did. Got it right here. But, you know, I'm such a slut. I'm just gonna give it away. Hey, you, sir. I love you. Hey. Hey, that's great! You got through to her. Hey, Katie. No. I wouldn't bore you with the seven million man-hours it took to build this 102-story testament to human will. So, you okay? That's very gallant. Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either. - I was your age my first time. Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, it was with this girl, Molly. Oh, I love you, too, Molly. (Voix off ) But I didn't. Look, I got to go. My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome. Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you. (Voix off) But I didn't. Molly? Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.(Voix off) But I didn't. And I never saw her again. I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have s*x. I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and... that's exactly what I did. Look, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like. Even the nice ones. You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you. Yeah, well... I love you, Molly. Wow. That was amazing. Wh-Where are you going? Will you call me? Yeah? But she didn't. I'm gay. I'm kidding. I love you, too. Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity. Katie ended up having a great first time in New York. And the last thing we did before she left was go to the Empire State Building. I am so glad we're finally doing this. Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go. Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 81: There are 1,860 steps from this... (They push him outside the elevator) Whoa, whoa! Come on! So, now you guys can finally say you've been to the Empire State Building. How have you lived here so long and never been to the top? Risky Business. That's War Games, and there's not even a s*x scene in it. Did anyone put Baby in a corner?"
470,2,12,the girl," Come on, what really happened?"
471,2,12,,"Ted (V.O.): Kids, you remember my first day with Robin. Robin is sick and in bed:  Ted (V.O.) : But, kids, later that night, Katie did it, and she got pregnant... with quintuplets... and she lived out her days in a trailer park... where she died an alcoholic. So the moral here, kids, don't have s*x until you're married. Maybe even, like, a year or two into marriage. Ted (V.O.): All right, here's what really happened."
472,2,13,barney ,"I have found that to be true. Mona. Watch it more closely. Rock your world. You mind if I charge my phone? Oh, my God! (barney's holding a painting) Do you know about this? Only the greatest thing ever. Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup. If they were to cure cancer tomorrow, this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week. Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall. I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time. Oh, come on, Robin. I know! We're gonna have so much fun! Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat. I know how much you love stools. Hey, guys. Guess what I got. A new dart. Oh, yes, Robin, I just love new dart. Nude art. We totally saw your butt. Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall? I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three. Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles? Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar. Classic! What a memorable prank. Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse. I've got a five-year rollout plan. I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city. Then, after New York... Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall. The painting's actually really great. Yeah. Paint me. Paint me. Paint me. We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame. I do not. In my body, where the shame gland should be, there's a second awesome gland. True story. Yeah. A nude Barney is a challenge. But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this. Now is the time-- I'm 31. I'm at the peak of my physical beauty. If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago. Long ago. I'll give you $5,000. Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in. This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art. I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift. I meant me. Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence. Goofy and unburdened, with wit. But me, I want something more regal. Something my progeny could look at and say, ""There's stands Barnabus Stinson."" He was wise... and strong. I get that a lot. Paint faster! Yeah. Wait, wait! That wasn't enough buildup. I need... In a world without justice, one man... All right. We had a deal! You...! Before you say anything, I'll give you an extra five grand. You people are so easy to control. Dance for me, puppets, dance. Thank you very much, Lily. A smooth area?! You gave me the Ken doll?! Marshall and Lily get out of the apartment. She left out Little Barney. Barnacle Junior. My Barnana is... Barnito Supreme."
473,2,13,boy ,That's stupid. (he destroys Ted's tower.)
474,2,13,carl ,"Hey, Marshall. What'll you have? Ooh, I'm sorry, that painting's property of the bar. I don't know what you're talking about. I doubt it. I doubt it. I doubt it."
475,2,13,co-worker," Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers, I get hay fever just looking at it.  Nothing. Um... nice shirt."
476,2,13,employees ,Happy birthday to you.
477,2,13,lily ,"Ted, you can't let him treat you like that. I knew this day would come. Because I didn't hide it very well. It's for class, and it's just that weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall. No, he's actually a little husky... Okay, just forget it. Well, then you'll have to do it. We're not in high school anymore. People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting. We're adults now. You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting. Are you serious? Well, thank you. You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes. What? What? Oh honey, you're awake? Yeah. I've kind of been wrestling with something. What if I told you I had a way to pay for our honeymoon? Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't want to spend our honeymoon in a cave? Well, what if I found a way to make a little extra money so that we spend our honeymoon not in Howe Caverns, but in Scotland? Yeah. And you know, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Glasgow... Maybe we can. Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you? Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting. Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked. Yeah! Okay, let's get this over with. Thank you. I don't think your sword will fit. Hold still. Hold still. Hold still! Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts. Oh, just drop them! Okay, it's done. I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it. Marshall, do you have the money? Let's get out of here!"
478,2,13,man ,"Looking for Hammond Druthers. These are divorce papers. You've been served. Yeah, but a bunch of us were up at the conference in Montreal, so we thought... Margarita Fridays--great idea, boss."
479,2,13,marshall ,"It's a blessing and a curse really. Yeah, you gotta ask yourself, who's the boss? Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture. Thank you. That's so sweet. You guys are being... so sweet. Okay, all right, so what, you guys found the painting, huh? How did you know that? Well, I just... don't think that some dude should drop trou just to pose for you. The frisbee dude with the soul patch? He's like the hottest guy in school! Oh, he's just huggable! And complicated... and a little bit of a jerk. Just enough so you think maybe you can change him. Call me old-fashioned, I just think that I'm the only guy you should see naked. Are you kidding me? What if somebody sees it? This painting has caused too much grief already. I'm destroying it right now. Where is it? You hung it up in the bar, didn't you? What'll I have? Um, I don't know, maybe a beer and that nude painting of me hanging behind the bar! I know that Barney gave you that painting. Whatever he's paying you, I'll pay you double. Whatever he's paying you, I'll give you that plus ten bucks. All right, you know what, Carl, you just lost yourself a regular customer. This painting is the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I'm awake. Is everything okay? Baby, our honeymoon's already paid for. We're going to Howe Caverns. It's not just a cave, it's a whole labyrinth of caves. It's an underground adventure. There's a cave that's so dark that you don't even know you're in there. I mean, we're going to experience a whole new kind of dark. Loch Ness? Loch Ness. Nessy. Baby, I would love to search for the enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch, but... we can't afford that. We're going to Loch Ness! This isn't right. This isn't right at all. No! No, this is not right! Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out! It's over! (he closes the door at Barney's face). (Yelling) Lily, I can't let you go through with this! (whispering) I found a castle we can stay in, but it's an extra two grand. (Yelling) It's just not right! (whispering). It's beautiful and they say it's haunted.  We accept. Yeah."
480,2,13,men ,# Happy birthday to you... #
481,2,13,mp ,"Fire him. Fire him! He's an arrogant, washed-up, pain in the ass. In fact, fire everyone on that project. Druthers, Mosby, the whole lot of them. Fine, Mosby can stay. But tell him he's on thin ice. Come here. I like you, Crosby."
482,2,13,mr druters," Uh, look, just a second, Ted."
483,2,13,mr druthers," Well, it's just... it's not exactly new, is it-- columns? I mean, what's your next groundbreaking idea-- ceilings? Floors? Windows?  Stairs?  Ceilings? Oops. Said that already. Then again, you seem to like rehashing old ideas. I'm kidding, of course. Another hole in one, boss.  Oh, sorry I'm late; lunch ran a little long. You wanted to see me, Mosby?  Well, excuse me, for spending the last four hours drawing designs for your building.  Oh, you had me. You so had me.  Mosby?  What are you doing?  Okay, fine, yes. Not that it's any of your business but my wife had a little spat a few weeks ago, and I've been sleeping here until she cools off.  Who am I kidding? She's never gonna take me back.  What did you want to say to me?  Yes. I'm an architect without a home. You see the tragic irony in that?  Cause I design homes.  But I don't have a home.  Why would I go to a hotel, when any second, she's going to call and tell me to come home. She's a very special lady, Ted. She's quite... mannish. She gives me what I need. Do you understand that?  If you were lost in the wilderness, she can provide for me.  I'm glad you came here tonight, Ted.  Call me Ham.  Hammy D?  Yeah, we should call him a gabby.  Hey, uh... thanks for putting me up last night, buddy. Give 'em hell.  Oh, God, not this again. Ted, a man in a toga just arrived and delivered a parchment. Let me read it: Oh! It's from ancient Greece. They want their basic architectural elements back. Geez.  You didn't hear me? Toga, parchment...  Ooh, I'm in trouble now.  We are friends. But that doesn't magically make your bad ideas good.  Ted, I hope that you're not going to let our professional woes interfere with our friendship, because I really kind of need you right now.  Come on, Ted, listen, why don't we get back and finish drawing the plans for a building which, in my opinion, is never going to get built, so you and I can get out of here and grab a couple of beers.  Oh, that's me. I'm Hammond Druthers.  She's really going through with this. So that's it. It's over.  She's giving me the remains of Wolfie? My dog is dead? Oh, my God. I can't believe this. She always played too rough with him.  Guys, you have no idea how much this means to me right now.  Oh, God..."
484,2,13,robin ,"Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up. Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking. Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that. Angela. Mona? So, what are you gonna do? Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing. Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist? Vicki, um... I'm so sorry about this, but there's been some budget cuts and, um, we have to let you go. I mean, after tonight. I still need my makeup for the broadcast. So... (Robin on TV wearing a lot of make-up.): Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims. What is that? Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it. No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun. So, you didn't fire him? And, uh... I... got you a rose. Oh, wow, a new dart. I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney.  Nude art. Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost? Oh, I'll go out with you. Bye, guys. So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him."
485,2,13,ted ,"Some kids dream of being astronauts. Some kids dream of playing baseball. When I was a kid, I had only one dream. To build a skyscraper. There were some obstacles along the way. But eventually my dream came true. I became an architect. Morning, everyone! So, I had an idea for the atrium. Ready? Columns. I... I can't believe you knocked over my model. I know what you're thinking: Who's this jerk? Well, this jerk was Hammond Druthers, a legend in the architecture community. Very big in the '80s. He was also far and away the worst boss I ever had. Then I designed the Spokane National Bank Building. And suddenly... I was his boss. - And he didn't like it. And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either. See, before, when I was just another employee, I was happy, carefree. The guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss. Did you see what he was wearing today? It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples. But suddenly I was a different guy. Hey, guys. What's so funny? Thanks. The hours were insane. I was always working even when I wasn't at work. Oh, Robin... I just had a great idea. Before, I used to be this guy. Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert. Just say you're sick. But now...I was this guy. Sick, huh? Unbutton your shirt. Hmm... ""Foo Fighters."" Get back to work. But still, the worst part was Druthers. Well, I was thinking... Why would you say that? Tony. Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss. So, I went to talk to the managing partner. Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project. Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear Mosby's doing some great work. Knock yourself out. You know what? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fire Druthers tomorrow. What? No. Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared. Uh, yeah, like four hours ago. This is a cocktail napkin. Covered in profanity. Look, Hammond, um, there's no easy way to say this, so... why don't we just, um, step into your office. I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised. Hey, that new dart is great.  Nude art. So the story on the painting is that,back in college, Lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class. Marshall wasn't so into the idea. Field trip! One of my worst fears has come true-- I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked. Well, I gotta go. Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office. Hammond, is that you? Druthers and I were alone in the office. If I was gonna fire him, this would be the best chance I'd ever have. Uh, no, I, I really need to talk to you. Look, there's no easy way to say... What, what are you doing? I'm standing here wearing pants. Are you sleeping here? What's going on? Okay, well, uh, you're right-- that is none of my business. Uh, look, there's no easy way to say this-- I... It's okay. Happy birthday, buddy. So, you've been living at the office? Yeah, I do. I see it. Not lost on me at all. But I don't understand, why don't you just go to a hotel? You could be sleeping on a mattress instead of... what appears to be torn-up drawings of my building. Uh, no, I don't. Well, that's the dream. Me too, Hammond. No, thanks. No, I think just Hammond. I was this close. Meanwhile, Lily had been up all night in the grips of a dilemma. That cabby would not shut up. I think it, you say it. Morning, team. So, I have given it some thought, and I say we revisit columns. What? Can I see you for one second? What are you doing? I thought we were friends. You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal. I tossed you more toilet paper. What? I don't believe this! You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes! And my And so, as Lily began painting, Marshall thought about the $5,000 and what his fiancee was doing to earn it. Finally, he could take it no more. And that's how Uncle Barney paid for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon. No. Look, Hammond, there's no easy way to say this but... Oh, God. There is no easy way to say this, but... Believe me, there is no easy way to say this... You've got to be kidding me! Wait, his birthday was yesterday! No! No birthday! No! I got something to say and I'm gonna get it out. Hammond, listen to me. I am sorry that your dog died, and that your wife is divorcing you and that... your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday. And there is no easy way to say... What are you doing? What's going on? Oh, come on, you're not going to pull that, are you? Oh! Look, yeah, right. Now we're falling onto the ground. Well, nice try, but guess what? You're fired! You're fired, you get it? You hear me? You're gone! You're fired! (Mr Druthers is taken on a stretcher with an oxygen mask on his face.) In my defense, I think we all suspected Hammond might have been faking. On the plus side, the EMTs seem to think he's going to be just fine and, as you saw, they did admit that I did not cause the heart attack, even if they said it a bit begrudgingly. And there it was, rock bottom: They all hated me. But just when all seemed lost, I had the greatest idea of my entire career."
486,2,13,voice ,Who's that? Who's out there?
487,2,13,,Mr. Druthers: That's stupid. (he destroys his model)
488,2,14,all ,Stay strong. We're so sorry. (the waitress leaves) Yes... Wouldn't miss for the world.
489,2,14,barman ,Oh! I didn't recognize you.
490,2,14,barney ,"""Problem."" Oh, poor Superman, he should really do something about his flying problem. It's not a problem if you're awesome at it. Not a clue. Seriously, that's the last time I'm gonna call you today. Okay. Good-bye. You didn't hang up either! I know! You hang up! You hang up! My bookie. Great guy. Have I taught you nothing, Ted? Suits are full of joy. They're the sartorial equivalent of a baby's smile. ""Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade."" Suits are for the living. That's why when it's my time to R.I.P. I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it buck naked. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies. What up?! Such a waste. A hand-stitched, cashmere, double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana. It must be so frightened. Oh, thank God! I'll find out. Ted, it's not a drinking game if you drink anytime anything happens. I don't bet. Betting's for suckers. Fine. Wait. This is mine, just like that? God, that feels good. No, that feels really... good. What else can we bet on? Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks plus six points for 500 bucks. $50?! What fun is $50?! Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall! Okay, $50. That's impossible. What the hell, I'm in. High five! Sorry. Solemn low five. Hey, take this key and swallow it. Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time. I'm not messing around, Theodore. I've got a lot of money riding on this game. If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator, I'll check the score. Please take the key. Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries. Where are you going? What? How the hell are you planning on getting in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score? There's TVs everywhere. Sir, who won the Super Bowl? You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?! Oh, my...! Emmitt Smith! Oh, thank God. You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl? But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?! No...! No...! I met Emmitt Smith today. Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game... I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss? Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks, whether or not there'd be a safety, first..."
491,2,14,carl ,"And even though we didn't see any whales, Mark and I both said it was the best day of our lives. Okay, I'm getting us another round. And when I come back, everyone else is telling their favorite Mark story."
492,2,14,doug ,"Hey. I'm Doug. Are you going to be staying here for the rest of day?  I know who won. How badly do you not want to know? Ten bucks. Just went up to eight. The team that won, want to know what their name rhymes with? I'm in love with Miss Aldrin. Does that mean Marshall gets a time-out? When one of us breaks something, we get a time-out. Hey. Hey. Yes, you are. You'll do whatever I say. Hold your breath. The winning team was the... (Marshall holds his breath) Now here's how this is going to work: you're going to take me to three R-rated movies a week... No, I didn't. Okay, okay. You win."
493,2,14,emmitt smith," Yeah, I get that a lot.  The game was last night? You know, once you win two or three of those things, it's kind of like, eh.  Dance, my friend. Dance."
494,2,14,kevin ,"Like morning commutes needed to get any harder. Well, Robin, what do you say? I think it's time to check in with Sid for a sports update. What? But it's, uh, time for Sports. We, we just did Weather. Okay, now it's time for Sports. Robin, it's time for Sports! Over to you, Sid. We'll be right back."
495,2,14,lily ,"Oh, my God. Well, I guess we should go, right? Mark. Mark. We are not fast-forwarding through the commercials. I know. He was so young. Oh, let's face it, we're not going to get to watch it. We should just find out the score. Oh, commercials! Oh, so lame. Nobody even pays attention. I mean, Janet Jackson, who cares? I'm in. And he's a little bit double-jointed... And his favorite animal is the Loch Ness monster. Well, I think we can all agree, he is much more interesting than Sally's one-eyed goldfish. Three weeks in a row? Come on, Sally. Okay, well, that's all the time we have. Arts and crafts, everybody. Okay, now who did this? Well, Marshall's a grownup, so... Sorry. Marshall gets a time-out. Didn't find out. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney. Well, at least the commercials aren't ruined. Ooh, you go first. Yeah, go ahead, Barney."
496,2,14,lou ,"Pretty much the same thing it was two minutes ago. Back to you, Robin."
497,2,14,man ,"You're right, Kevin. And we're clear. Back in five... four... three... Sorry. I missed the game."
498,2,14,man 1," Hey, buddy.  Hey, buddy, look out."
499,2,14,man 2," I... don't really follow sports.  Hey, dude, look out.  Dude, watch out!"
500,2,14,marshall ,"If I were a chicken, I'd go cannibal for those bad boys. Just eat my own damn wing off. I don't care. I'm crazy like that. Oh, my gosh. No idea. Wait... tomorrow night at 6:00, that's the Super Bowl. Okay, that's great, but just to make sure it records, maybe we should bow our heads and say a quiet prayer to the TiVo gods. Amen. Dibs on the one Carl just told. Are these chicken wings or angel wings? God, I love these things. Calm down, buddy. Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks that Casey misses this field goal. Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal. See, there you go, he made it. You win. Nothing, it's the halftime show. I can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months to our sacred day. Now she's gonna be in all the pictures. Are you crazy? Maybe for $50. I'm in. Lily, how many times...? Nessie is a gentle creature. We're trying to stay away from terms like ""Monster."" Oh, hey, I'm Marshall. Yeah, I'm actually trying to hide out 'cause I don't want to know who won the Super Bowl. Oh, um, that's great, but I really don't want to know, so if you could just keep that to yourself. Excuse me? Are you serious? Come on, dude. You promised you'd stop if I ate all those crayons. Why are you doing this? Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin, she's mine. I did. I'm not talking to you. I'm not holding my breath. Oh, no. Somebody wet their pants. Oh, really? Who's everyone gonna believe? I'm a grownup third-year law student at Columbia and you're just a little pants wetter. So now I ask you a question: You want to be able to quietly sneak off to the restroom and dry off or am I gonna have something for show and tell today? Hey, everyone... I want my money back. And your pudding snack pack. No...! Yeah, I didn't know and now I do know. Wings are still good. Hey, so check this out: I got extorted by a five-year-old today."
501,2,14,robin ,"Yeah, they're the best part. Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute. This is going faster than I thought. We'll make an appearance at the bar for the wake, we'll be watching the game by 8:00. Okay, I have to be at work exactly one Super Bowl from now. Hey, I'll take that action. Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand. Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings? Oh, commercials! Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious. I'm in. But unfortunately, the City won't be fixing the unusually large pothole any time soon, so buckle up if you're on the BQE. It's gonna be a bumpy one. No! No. No, it's not. It's time for Weather. Well, weather's pretty fickle, it may have changed. What's it doing out there, Lou? No! Let's go to Traffic Todd in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper. I'm sorry. I haven't watched the game yet. I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl. I mean, change the teleprompter. No team names, nothing specific. My friend Mark passed away this week. It's just so hard. And after the Super Bowl, the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up, sending the mayor of the winning team's city 15 pounds of a delicacy his of her city is famous for. Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor. And let's end the day on a happy note. There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo. Trish Sanchez has the story. No...! Mission accomplished. Way to blow it. Beer still works. I almost got fired today."
502,2,14,sid ,"Thank you, Kevin and Robin. Let's talk about the Super Bowl. And that closes the book on one heck of a Super Bowl. Back to you, Kevin and Robin."
503,2,14,ted ,"Kids, I told you stories about all the big holidays - Christmas... Halloween... Thanksgiving... but one holiday was always my favorite-- Super Bowl Sunday. And there was one Super Bowl back in 2007 that I will never forget. Marshall, you're on beer detail. Lily, you're making the bean dip. Uh, Robin, you're on chips and pretzels, and Barney, I'm giving you nothing to do so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem. And I will be going to Quinn's to pick up the world's greatest food, the Super Bowl Hot Wings Platter. What's tomorrow night? Who was Mark? Okay, I feel terrible, but the truth is we didn't know Mike. Mark, and as long as we send flowers, I can't think of any reason we'd have to Carl (at the bar): Get out of here! I never want to see your face in this bar again! This soulless b*st*rd just told me he can't come to Mark's funeral because he wants to watch the Super Bowl. Could you believe that? You guys are coming, right? Okay, here's the plan: record the game, go to the funeral, pay our respects to Matt... Mark, and start watching only an hour late. Almighty TiVo, we thank you for all the gifts you have given us: the power to freeze live TV to go take a leak is nothing short of Godlike. Let's not forget fast-forwarding through commercials. It seems greedy to ask anything more from you, O magic box, but if you malfunction and miss the Super Bowl, we will destroy you in the Amen. Oh, come on. Remember last year? Who wants to watch a monkey in a coconut bra order a pizza? So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up? Virtually. Sartorial""? No, no, no, we can't! We have to watch the game together. It's tradition. Think of all the great times we've had watching this game. Second down, everyone drink. I love you guys. This is so great, all of us watching the Super Bowl together. This is special. We need to do this every year, promise me! Everyone drink! God, this is such a great tradition, all of us watching the game together. How did this start? God, how cool is Robin? Look, we always watch the Super Bowl together. So we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 6:00 and go the next 18 hours without finding out who won. I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy. That means no TV, no Internet, no newspapers, nothing. Media blackout. But our tradition lives on. Who's in? Dude, we're at a wake. As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world. What? No. Lots more, no. Fine. But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan and I think that's funny. The media blackout was particularly hard on Robin because, well, she was the media. Weeks earlier, Marshall had promised Lily he'd come into her kindergarten class for show-and-tell day. Not until game time. Pick up the hot wings. Ah, don't worry. I got it all planned out. First of all: I placed duct tape on a pair of sunglasses so I can only see out of two tiny holes. Next, I constructed blinders out of an old cereal box. Top it all off: high-tech noise-reducing headphones I bought when Marshall and Lily first got back together and were doing it a lot. I call it the Sensory Deprivator 5000. Hello! Uh, my name is Ted Mosby. I'm here to pick up my hot wings. In my hand, you'll find the exact total for the wings plus a generous tip. Please take the cash. Put the wings in my hand and I'll be on my way. Thank you! Ha! Who's the idiot now?! You said the Sensory Deprivator 5000 was stupid. But it totally worked! (barney leaves and Ted doesn't notice.) I couldn't see or hear anything happening around me. Right?! Right?! (He takes his glasses off) No...! And if that weren't bad enough, I was about to have a horrible realization. Where's the dipping sauce? And then Uncle Marshall got an idea. It was not one he was proud of in retrospect, but desperate times... Hello! It's me again. Yeah, you forgot to give me the dipping sauce! Ah. Yes. This is the one. It was 4:00, and so far, all of us had done the impossible. But then, almost simultaneously, things started to go wrong. Yes...! Awesome. Just in time for kick-off. None of you guys found out the score, right? Great. Let's do it. I already fast-forwarded through the four hours of pre-game coverage. So we are ready. (Barney comes in) Barney, I can't even look at you. I don't want any sign of who won. Don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away. Feel free to start without me. Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! So much money! You screwed it up, Barney! You screwed everything up! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Okay, let's watch the game. Barney, what the hell was that? We know who you bet on. Now you've ruined the game for everyone. There's no point in even watching the game. Ah, what the hell. Let's watch Barney lose some money. I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000. And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that? 50-50, give or take."
504,2,14,the waitress," Here's the info for tomorrow night.  Oh, God, you didn't hear? Mark died.  The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00, and I know it would have meant a lot to Mark if you came. You guys were his favorite customers."
505,2,14,trish sanchez, And in honor of yesterday's big win...  ...the zoo decided to name the baby panda after Super Bowl champions...
506,2,14,woman ,"Um, Robin, is it just me, or were you doing something different there? That is crazy. I can't do that. Okay, sweety okay. Okay, I'm so sorry."
507,2,15,barney ,"Training for a marathon. You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it. Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to. Absolutely. Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two. 50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it $10,000. Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50. What up, non-finishers? Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won. So where's my 50 bucks? Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym. Wow. You know I really should check out this ""subway."" Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight. No. Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway. I was sitting here, totally minding my own business. Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean. My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around. Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour? Ted, Ted. I'm sorry. I can't. Ted! No...!  I can't go. I've got this thing. A pen1s."
508,2,15,lily ,"You want some aspirin, baby? Marshall used to think he was indestructible. This tracking thing is amazing. When we get married, you're getting one of these. Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run! I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner. Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly. What? ""It is important to load up on carbohydrates two to four hours before a big run. Try a breakfast of a bagel, a banana, oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice."" Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said. ""Don't forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement."" ""Chafing or blisters can occur in a number of areas, including the feet, armpits, or even the nipples. Try using some petroleum jelly on the affected areas."" We have to camp out. You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun. What thing? Oh, wow. Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet! Vera Wang! Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here? Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998. Only fewer mullets. Ooh, this is comfy. We might actually be able to sleep. Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute. (5 hours later) I don't think I can take this. Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again, but then it does. Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on? If we get through this, I swear I'm gonna live my life differently. It's him. It's the car guy!"
509,2,15,man ,"Morning, ladies. Oh, my God! You're that reporter from Metro News 1. You did that story on the giant pizzas? One moment, sir. Were those pizzas real? Come on, were they?  I knew it! Well, the, uh, flight attendants are just finishing up their final seat count. Let me see what I can find out. I think it might hurt. This is such a nightmare. Uh, sir? Uh, I'm afraid not. There are no extra seats on the plane. I'm sorry."
510,2,15,marshall ,"Oh, man, it kills. You know I don't believe in pain killers. Well, it added up. I've never broken anything. I've never been sick, and when I need to, I can summon incredible strength. Ted, tell her the story of the really heavy door. On one pull. Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste. What? You're kidding, right? So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon? You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50. Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online, see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe. This ought to be good. Wow. (48 minutes later) He's already passing the second checkpoint. He's gotta be cheating, okay. He knew we'd check. Well, it looks like, ""Barney"" should be coming over the Queensboro Bridge and up First Avenue within the next hour or so. But... there is no way that that's really him. It's really him. All right. I got to admit, you earned this. Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today. Best 50 bucks I ever spent. My pants are starting to feel a little tight. I cannot allow this. I am going to run the New York City Marathon. Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style. Liquids are digested faster. That way, no energy is wasted, and it's all about the run. This is gonna be your best run yet. You're going to accomplish all of your goals. You are a robot sent from the future to win the marathon! You are... Marshall. You are... Marshall. You are Marshall! Yeah! Oh, gosh! Dude, you are a terrific runner. Tomorrow you're gonna run and finish the New York City Marathon! You're the best. You look good. Nobody does it better than you. Nobody does it better than you."
511,2,15,old lady, Douche.
512,2,15,policeman ,Hey!
513,2,15,robin ,"That security guard was a little bit handsy. His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job? Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do? I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night dreaming about being a... I mean, uh... This is a cool job. Your uniforms are pretty. Could you just call the firm and explain what happened? Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault? Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe? Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow. Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers. Ooh, he's starting! Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive. See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight. Well, he never even called you back? What was the name of the airline again? Was the ""R"" backwards? Geez. If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault. Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault? Marshall? Oh, my God! That really wasn't my fault. I wouldn't have walked in on Hey, what's going on here? Yeah, but for what? Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks? Are you serious? This is the place. You said wang. You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York. That's kind of annoying. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along? I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time. Get out of here! Marshall?! Oh, my God! (Marshall falls) So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store, we would have made the first flight. Yes, yes, I am. I can't believe you recognized me.  One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is, God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight. Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out for a wedding dress? Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting. No, it's not. You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty. Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again. Hey, what's going on? Yeah, but for what? And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there, and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day. And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny. All, right, well, thanks for trying. Ted, come on. Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today. Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule."
514,2,15,rubin ,"Yeah, he just jumped a subway turnstile."
515,2,15,ted ,"Kids, never underestimate the power of destiny. Because when you least expect it, the littlest thing can cause a ripple effect that changes your life. Take for instance my trip to Chicago. That's funny. She barely touched me. Uh, Gate 23. Come on. If we miss this flight, I will never forgive myself. Why was this flight so important? Let's back up a few months to the fall of 2006. I had just sold my first building design and become the youngest project manager in my firm's history. Suddenly I was being headhunted. One firm was even considering me to run their entire New York office. They were flying me in for a final interview at their corporate headquarters in Chicago. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. It was my destiny. There was just one problem. Hi, wait, two more. Well, I'm sure if we pull real hard we can open them. Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss the chance to interview for my dream job. Please, I have to be on this flight. Thanks. Great, please let us know as soon as you hear anything. Normally, I'm incredibly responsible. I just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced. Not that I'm a criminal or anything. That thing better have call waiting. It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today. I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage. I'm so stupid. Why did I have to jump that turnstile? She had a point. It was kind of Barney's fault. Let's back up a few months. Wow, your first broken bone. Kind of kills your whole ""Unbreakable"" theory. There was a really heavy door. He opened it. Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles. The next morning, as the marathon began, we were focused on Marshall's computer. Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet. Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang ""Hungry Like the Wolf,"" and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to? Wow. Very impressive, Barney. You're dating a girl from New Jersey? So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon. But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call. Hello? What, what are you talking about?  Barney's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train. All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are. Barney?! You're right. Everything can be traced back to him. Like that rash we all got at Christmas. I have to see what's going on. Really? That's great! Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on? What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today. It turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me to Chicago on time for my job interview, but it was all the way on the other side of the airport. I think it was something like Flights R' Us. God, I hope not. Stupid smart carts. More like dumb carts. You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if Marshall hadn't broken his toe. For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April. So, yes, it was your fault. I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time! (Ted fells) And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport. Oh, looks like they're camping out for something. I don't know. Usually there's a Stormtrooper or Klingon in line to give you some indication. ""Annual wedding dress blowout. Designer sample dresses up to 90% off. Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m."" The next morning, Robin was too tired to go all the way back to Brooklyn, so while I was at work, she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours, and that's when... Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it. Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight. Would you check to see if you have any more seats? Robin... Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny? No. Wait. It goes back further. Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side? 1939?! This penny's from 1939! (at the bar with Robin) A 67-year-old penny. Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II? Look, I know a little something about coins, and this baby is worth something to a collector. Yes, it is! You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner with the money I get for this little guy. Hey, that's 150 times its original value. Actually, the meal was only $1.49. 1984. How dare you. I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something. It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town. Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe. Barney wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date... I wish I did. Though that person's already been punished enough, losing a sweet penny like that. Oh, please tell me you have some good news. I can't believe this. That's it, it's over. But that's not what happened. They didn't reschedule. They hired someone else. And as it turned out, three months later, that guy ended up having to relocate to Chicago. Kids, funny thing about destiny, I thought I was destined to get that job. But I was wrong. My destiny was to stay in New York. Because if I hadn't, I never would have met your mother."

517,2,15,woman ,"Sorry, you're too late, I already shut the doors. Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but see, once I close those doors, that's it. Nobody else is allowed down that jet-way. Except for that guy. I'm sorry, sir. I'll see what I can do. But it doesn't look good. Okay. They haven't armed the doors yet, so you still have a chance. It's up to the captain now and they're calling us back. Sure, and for the future, we recommend you arrive at the airport an hour and a half before your flight, not, you know, one minute after. You seem to have a lot of problems with the rules of travel. (The phone rings) Hello? Oh, that is great news. It's my mom-- she found her missing earring. Have a seat. I'll call you when I hear something. Where was it? Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him? So I was able to get you two seats. No, no, not you. I'm talking to my mom about Blue Man Group. Ma, can I call you back? I'm still waiting for... Huh. Looks like your flight left already. Well, it's typical pilot.They don't call you back at work and they don't call you back after you spend two nights with them at a Radisson in Orlando."
518,2,15,,Marshall: Ted( voix off): And that's exactly what I did.
519,2,16,barney ,"I don't know. Is she fat? I-I don't take flyers. That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings? Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid... Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this. Asking someone to come see your play is like asking someone for a ride to the airport or to crash on your couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers and repeat after me: Friends don't let friends come see their crappy play. Yes, you should break up. Oh, God, why is this part of the story? What's wrong with her? What word, ""moist""? Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants. I vote they can stay. ""Check out the jackass in the parachute pants"" is a good icebreaker. Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots. I side with Robin. Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's. From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory. I know where I don't want to sit. I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke. No? Okay. I am outta here. Wow, Lily, that sucked! What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends. Yeah, if you're a Smurf. Oh, really? You would? Bad move, Aldrin, bad move. Even I wouldn't do that. Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play. Oh, it's not a joke. It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night. And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long, I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends. Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong... Good. Okay, I gotta go rehearse. Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho; the first three rows get wet. Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist. I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over. Feelings. Inside. Oh, no! Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show? Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it. Act two is where I really hit my stride. Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love. Lily: How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show? It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two. The robot found love Confusing my circuitry My software's been hacked Toaster oven You're the one for me Two, three, four."
520,2,16,ex-girlfriend 1, I'm Ted's college girlfriend. He made me 12 mix tapes. How many has he made you?
521,2,16,ex-girlfriend 2," He calls you ""sweetie pie""? He called me ""sweetie pie."""
522,2,16,ex-girlfriend 3," I'm stupid, but my rack is bigger than yours."
523,2,16,lily ,"Hot off the presses! Fine. It's a flyer from my play. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! Seriously, stop! No, it's not. It was probably Carla's. Her face was a train wreck. Ah, the age-old question: after you break up with someone, what do you do with the stuff? Yes! All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first. Order! Order! I got to side with Robin. She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff upsets her, you got to get rid of it. I am Rage... Envy! This is the face of Consumerism! No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about. You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards. Yes. What's the matter with you? You can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair, but not their dog. Very funny. Oh, we'll be there. Never. Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh? You're gonna k*ll your dogs?! Oh, thank God. Aw, you know, if I were five dogs, I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn. Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs. Uh... uh.... uh... People upstate. Oh, look, it's starting. Shh! I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do. Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show. No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar. Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go. Yeah, well, anyway."
524,2,16,man ,"We'll be starting our Q&A with the director-- yours truly-- in five minutes right here. Barney runs out Guess what position we did it in. Oh, yeah, that's the spot. Dude, I gotta pee."
525,2,16,man 1, I... am... Rage!
526,2,16,man 2," Hello, Greed, Rage...Envy... and Consumerism. I... am your father... America!"
527,2,16,marshall ,"Okay, so you have to have s*x with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go! Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat. You took one two seconds before you walked in here. Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good. She hates that word. I'm don't think Ted was dating her for her face. Nice, right? Ted. Ted? Ted? They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside. Creamsicle and turkey gravy, not at the same time. I've got to side with Ted. Just 'cause you still have something an ex girlfriend gave you doesn't mean you're holding onto her. Guys, four together! No, you're not. You have to stay. Oh, my God. Ted's part of the play. Oh, baby, that was wonderful! Barney! She's not getting rid of the dogs. I miss Jebediah. Are you sure you're gonna be okay? I mean, you know that this is gonna be... I never get picked for audience participation. That's two."
528,2,16,robin ,"How about Mimi's? Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go. We did? Because it wasn't me. I've never seen Van Helsing. My boss just got back from Maui. He said it was really romantic. When were you in Maui? With my sister. Why do you always say that? Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people. It's silly to try to act like we didn't. Totally. I don't want to hear that. God, that is so insensitive. You're a jerk! Mm, we should get down to the bar. Damn, my face is so dry. Is there any moisturizer around here? So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist... face lotion... Wow, this is great stuff. Now I know the secret to your great complexion. No, it's not. Whose moisturizer is this, Ted? So, in other words, some girl you went out with. Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes? Why is that still in your apartment? Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl? Not three dollars! Try 14. Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer! Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town. It sounds like a whore to me. What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around? No. No! No! Oh, Ted! Question? Ain't no question, girl. Obviously, he's got to get rid of it. So we agreed that we would let you guys decide. I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old Well, that's adorable, but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see. Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross. Your mom's creepy and gross. Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches? Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this? Come on. It's not gonna be that bad. And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, ""Now we are really cookin'!"" Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play? It was pretty bad, though. Oh, my God, you've been robbed! All that stuff was from old girlfriends? Don't you buy anything for yourself? Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have s*x with you when I'm really tired. Nope. Well, except for my dogs. What's your point, Ted? What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends? That's ridiculous. But not living things. Things with a heartbeat can stay. Pickles, go get your ball. Go get your ball. Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs? Um, no. Yes! I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from. So we're-we're okay? Yeah, he really is. It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs. Might be time to send them to the farm. No! No, no, no, there really is a farm. My aunt has a farm upstate. Yeah. I could visit them on weekends. My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty. ""They""? What do you mean by ""they""? Hey. I gave my dogs away to my aunt. Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but... I think it's for the best. Can we go inside? Why? What's going on inside? What? You said you threw all that stuff away! We're really doing this?"
529,2,16,ted ,"Kids, the key to a good relationship is communication. You need to talk. Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's. Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's. You love that place, remember what a great time we had the last time we were there? Yeah, yeah. We had that crazy waiter who kept going, ""You two should get married! You two should get married!"" It's also important to know when to stop talking. Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining. It was so romantic? How can you not remember this? Oh, right! It was... my sister. You see, by the time you've hit your late 20s, you've dated a few people, but when you're in a relationship, it's common courtesy to pretend that you haven't. Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on. Remember when we went to see it? We sat in the back row.  That's right. I saw it with my sister. Oh, it's so romantic. I... went... with my sister. You're right. We should just be honest. See that girl over there? Three years ago, I totally made out with her. What? You said... Remember honesty...? Well, you're...confusing. Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us. So, earlier tonight... I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt. We're getting to it. Yeah, there's some in the bathroom. Got to moisturize! Got to keep that pretty face moist. What are you talking about? It's yours. Oh, well... then I guess it's Lily's. Um, my sister's. Um... I love you. Thank you, Marshall. Thank you so much. I don't know. I just never threw it out. Yeah. I'm madly in love with her, and the only way I can deal with it is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion. Why is this such a big deal? Whoa, she wasn't a whore. Nothing. That's it. Well, except for the phone booth. And the lamp by the desk... and the... Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it. Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants. Sorry, buddy, it's a ""no"" for me, too. Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called. Even they don't want those pants back. Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal. I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano, I don't think of Jeannie Radford, I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe. And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses. I remember when I was broke, just out of college, and I really needed a lamp. And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein. I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there. Really? You can't look at a pillow without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow! You're creepy and gross. All right, Barney. It all comes down to you. What? Just stop, sweetie. So I had no choice. I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends. It was painful, but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night. New York is famous for its theater, but there's many different levels. There's Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, homeless people screaming in the park, and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in. Where do you guys want to sit? Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer. I know. He can be really insensitive. Oh, my God, it was so bad. Nope. What can I say? Papa gets swag. And that should've been the end of it. But the next day... You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff. But seeing how happy it makes you - totally worth it. Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Well, sit. Sit, yeah. So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you? So I had to get rid of everything from my past relationships because you don't keep things from your past relationships except, uh, where are your five dogs from? Oh, that's right: your past relationships. Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment, and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends? I do now. I thought you said you got rid of everything your ex-boyfriends gave you. Well, yeah, but not my dogs. You said everything. Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away. Enjoying this? Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you to make me get rid of all my stuff. Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs. Really? Well, I say we take it to the group, but I don't like your chances. I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them. That was ridiculous. Yeah, we're great. And I thought we were, but just as it did in the seventh act of Aunt Lily's play, Jealousy reared its ugly head. I gotta go. That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show. And then we endured about 20 minutes of this. And then it just got weird. And when that didn't work... So we stayed and let Barney torture us for another hour and a half, 'cause that's what friends do, apparently. Where've you been? I called you earlier. You what? Wow. Oh, man. Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar. Um, the floors are gone. Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed. This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail. I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs! Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had. It was one of those fights that last for hours and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about. We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window. Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy. But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me, but somehow we got to here. Yeah."
530,2,16,ted and robin, We're moving in together!
531,2,16,woman ,I... am Greed.
532,2,17,all ,Close enough!
533,2,17,barney ,"We insisted. How's the Fiero? Well, I'm trying, but it's... Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it. Aw, nerts. Really? Seems impossible. With privileges, from the sound of it. Wow. Looks like he really needs a hug. Ted. How dare you... Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here. Love it? Hold on a second. Love it? I hate it! Why? Why? Why?! Why?! Hey. Uh, is Marshall around? I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride. Hey! Why don't you drive me? It'll be like a total road trip. Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits. Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel. See you later. What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving. Hitting the road. Cruising the lanes. And braking. Honking. Love it. Except for lady drivers. Don't get me started on lady drivers. Trick question. Yes, it is. Middle, left, right? I never learned how to drive! I grew up in the city. I never had a chance. This isn't right. God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds. Dude, a dog. What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted. Which? Which one's the break again? Left. Oh, man, left. I'm totally blanking. I don't know why I turned on the radio! We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted. Help me, Ted! I'm being serious. I can't move. I can't... I can't feel my... Wait. Wait. We're okay. We're okay. It's a miracle, Ted! ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina hummina. I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap. But fate... fate gave me a second chance. And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander. So I decided from that moment on to continue living life to its fullest. True story. Yes! Rot in hell, devil steed."
534,2,17,brother ,Put it in.
535,2,17,brother 1, Congratulations.  Just go to the Weinerburger drive-thru and get us 12 cups of coffee.
536,2,17,brother 2," The Fiero is yours. If you pass the final test.  Oh, yeah. But we get to decide what you wear."
537,2,17,lily ,"Surprise. Oh, it goes back and forth. It's sort of a tr*nny car. Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up. Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you? No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out. You said you were gonna marry me that long ago? That is so sweet. The car's on its deathbed, Robin. I have to clear my conscience. Okay. Shortly after we met Robin, she and I were jonesing for Thai food from this one place. I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule. Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious. Okay. Here's what we'll do. We'll drive over, pick it up, have them double-bag it, very carefully drive it back here with the windows open, and he'll never know. (Lily slows down the car and knock down the food). Wow, these brakes are really sensitive. Oh, Marshall is gonna k*ll me! This and the difference between ""affect"" and ""effect"" are the only two things he's really serious about. No, it's not. Marshall's gonna freak. Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do? Oh, God, oh...! There's two in the glove compartment, but he's been saving them. These cigars aren't helping at all. Now it just smells like a homeless guy threw up in here. End of flasback. We had to make it look realistic. Marshall, I'm so sorry, but sharing that secret-- that's when Robin and I became best friends. What? Why? So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all. That's so sweet. The first car our two kids remember."
538,2,17,maechanic ,"Hey, geniuses. The back wheels are on blocks. That car ain't going anywhere."
539,2,17,man ,"You're naked. You have 50 cents? Sorry, we're all out of trays and lids. Two tall guys just came through here a few minutes ago and bought 'em all. Hey. You lovers better just keep on driving."
540,2,17,marshal ,What are you talking about?
541,2,17,marshall ,"I can't believe this moment's finally here. One more mile and my little boy turns 200,000. Yeah, he does. Hey, light up those cigars in the glove compartment. They're real Cubans. I got 'em in Chinatown last year just for this moment. What? No. Oh. No. No, no, no. No, there's only.8 miles to go. Come on, buddy. Buddy! Hey. It's very important to both Lily and me that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our wedding's... I couldn't even get through it. Thank God. She's still in triage. My brothers handed it down to me when I was 16. Not really. Come on! I already shaved my legs and swallowed five dollars in quarters. Only $4.50 has come out. That's it? Agreed. Totally agreed. I'm aware of that. No... Look, can I just have my coffee, please? It is not insane. Ah, the Fiero-asco. The Fiero-asco? I thought Ted was a little bit pretentious. Hey (Marshall throws a sandwich in the trash but misses it) I'm driving my Fiero back over break. I know we see enough of each other as it is, but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money. You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up. All right, well, call me if you change your mind. My odometer's going to hit 100K. I hear you. Yeah. Dude, we're college freshmen. I'm not going to get tied down by the first chick I hook up with. Lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know? Oh, it's the best song in the world. It's the only song I like. Just kidding. Tape's been stuck in the player for, like, two years. Better than nothing, though. Don't worry. It comes around again. Yeah, we totally nailed the ending. What? Zitch dog. Zitch dog. 12-nothing. Zitch dog, blue Suburban. 18-nothing. Where the hell are we?! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I think you skipped something. Doesn't seem like a smart idea. Then we got lost. Where the hell are we?! I'm pulling over. We're almost out of gas, and we might not even be on a road anymore. Nah, I threw them out. No food or drink in the Fiero. Pretty sure that my foot is frozen solid. Thanks, Ted. You're a good friend. And if I die first, you just leave my body alone. Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me; it skeeves me out. Wasn't an easy decision. It's perfectly rational. Okay. Dude... I hate to say this... but it's so cold... there's only one way that we're gonna make it through this night.(they're both in the back seat in each other arms) We should've kept driving. No. No. We might die now. I may never see Lily again. I never told anybody this, but... I've known for a long time that I'm gonna marry that girl. If we survive this, someday I'm gonna marry her. I'm sorry about your spectacles. Yeah? Yeah. Zitch dog! He said it would be at least 3,000 bucks to make it run again. And even then, there's no guarantee. I know that it's a lot of money, but it's my Fiero, you know? I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job, and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit. I've been through so much in that car. The suicidal cat. Hitchhiking Waldo. (a guy is sitting between Barney and Marshall in the car)The homeless guy who broke in through the window and threw up all over the backseat. Guys, what are you talking about? The broken windows? Why did you break two of them? Can't believe this whole time it was you guys. I've been blaming really tanned dancing leotard guy. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it. It's lived a great life and it deserves to die with dignity.Ted: But 200,000... But that's life. You know? You never end up where you thought you wanted to be. I'm not helping the environment. Ted's not a philosopher. Lily's not not a world-famous artist. Barney's never driven more than ten miles an hour. Robin, I'm sure, has also experience disappointment in her life. Maybe? And my Fiero's not a Fiero that went 200,000 miles. It's okay. You know? Those are old dreams. We'll get a new car and we'll fill that one up with new memories. And that'll be the car we had when we were first married. When we owned our first house. Maybe even the first car our four kids remember. I would like to say good-bye. Marshall is in the car and the other are around it. Marshall taps the dashboard and the cassette goes out. Affected. Just making sure. Got us all a lot of places. I mean maybe it's time we return the favor. This Fiero should have made it to 200,000. So, let's get it out that door. And we'll push it the last.7 miles. It'd do the same for us. Marshall puts the cassette back in and they all start to push. Close enough! Arrivederci, Fiero! You were the freaking giving tree of cars.Lily: May you rust in peace. Bro. Have you heard this new song? I just got the cassingle. I am never going to get sick of this song. Never, ever, never, never, ever. Yeah!"
542,2,17,mechanic ,"Eriksen. (Marshall follows the mechanic) Wow. What a special car. So, can I crush it into a little cube yet?"
543,2,17,robibn ,Hey.
544,2,17,robin ,"We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here. How long have you had her... slash him? Oh, how nice of them. What's the 100K fiasco? Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life, but it's really mostly machine at this point. Lily, don't. Be strong. Do not go all ""prisoner's dilemma"" on me. An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long. But Thai food, Lily. Pad Yum Mao. Tom Kai Gah. Thai See Ran. Lily, it's gonna be fine. Shut up! Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking. Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage. Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts-- the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up. Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai. You mentioned cigars. Hand me those chopsticks. Hey, how about some tunes? Oh, great song. Yeah. This was a terrible idea. It looked like fun when she did it. So I wanted to try. Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much? Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car."
545,2,17,ted ,"This is awesome. Your baby Fiero's grown into a really old man Fiero. And just like an old man, he leaks fluid, smells stale, makes weird noises out the back. Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off, but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins. Whoa, pothole. The car stops. Is it cool if I still light these? Kids, sometimes life forces us to be someone we didn't want to be. When that happens, we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were. Maybe a tattoo. Or a piece of jewelry. A tiny souvenir that reminds us, ""This is who I really am."" Marshall's souvenir was not so tiny, but the more he found himself being pushed toward the corporate world and away from his dream of saving the environment, the tighter he held on to that Fiero. Hey. One good thing: we're off the hook for the folding party today. Hey, your car's going to be fine. This is the best auto shop around. Look at this certificate. One of the mechanics here finished a 64-ounce steak. Terrific. She? I thought it was your little boy. And that is the origin of Marshall's insane ""no food or drinks in the Fiero, not even groceries"" rule. The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it. Remember the 100K fiasco? Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco. It was just before winter break our freshman year of college. Marshall and I were roommates, but we weren't really good friends yet. And Marshall was a total slob. All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio. I live in the moment. Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving. We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so... She'd be so bummed if I left early. It was totally mutual. I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I... it was... it was totally mutual. So what's up with you and Lily? Anything serious So... this song. Maybe. I am so... sick... of this song. What do you mean? That was probably our best one. Hey, you want to play Zitch Dog? Uh, it's a car game. Every time you see a dog, you got to be the first one to say, ""Zitch dog."" I'm pretty good, so... Well, no, I didn't know we had...we'd started, but... Okay, that's cool. You got the first point. Zitch dog. Damn it! Are we still playing? 'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really... Marshall. Marshall. Damn it! Then Marshall, who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog, got us totally lost. Hey, we got some time. What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know? Robert Frost. Too late. I'm taking this exit. Who's not fun enough now, Karen? No, keep driving. It's below zero out. If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days. Plus, I only have, like, six granola bars and three bottles of water. What?! No food or drink in the F...? You haven't washed your sheets since... (Voix off): Thus began the longest night of our lives. Marshall... there's a very real chance that we're gonna be snowed in here for days. If I die first, do whatever you need to survive. Eat my flesh. Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever. What? I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me. But... but you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't. This is all because of your insane no-food rule. Hey! My spectacles! Hey. I know we're low on gas, but can we turn on the heat for just a minute? Come on, Marshall. That's okay. They were decorative. Hey, Marshall. Are you still thinking about Lily? Please stop.(voix off) And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere. But funny thing... Damn it! That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends. Well, it's a pretty old car. Let me tell it. It was last year during the transit strike. Hey. Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys. To Queens? Wait! You know how to drive, right? Which pedal's the gas? No, it's not No, it's not. Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up. Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race. Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing. Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes. The left one. Make the Ls Why did you just turn on the radio? Relax. You're being crazy. Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun! We're okay. Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he... You know what? This Fiero, it's effected all our lives. That's what I said. And so Marshall said good-bye to his Fiero. And as the car's final gift to us all, the money he got for scrap parts paid our bar tab for the next two nights. And what better friend is there than that?"
546,2,17,ted and robin, What?
547,2,17,,"Ted(voix off): The next few hours of our drive were classic road trip. Ted and Marshall singing: Just to be the man who walks 1,000 miles And falls down at your door... Ted:Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so. .Barney: Oh, we're not going to make it."
548,2,20,all ,To Lily and Marshall.
549,2,20,bareney ,"Yes, Robin?"
550,2,20,bareny ,"Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going as for Halloween?"
551,2,20,barney ,"Really? Then whatever happened to your plan of spending the last two weeks before your wedding sleeping apart? Yeah. It's a dirty story, isn't it? You guys went out to dinner, did it in the kitchen and got caught. Scherbatsky reeks of someone who likes to get caught. So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart? Night-night tape? Did you make a tape of you saying ""night-night"" to her? Oh, that is so sweet. Why don't you kiss? I love it when two chicks make out. What's on there? Retail price $319.99. What else? Ah, $549.99. A little greedy, don't you think? No, I'm training. I'm glad you asked. Ted, Robin, get in here! You guys know how it's hard to be friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome? Well, this isn't going to make it any easier. I am going to be on... The Price Is Right. Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields is going to call out my name, and I will come on down. Are you kidding? T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television, it's a microcosm of our entire economic system-- a capitalist utopia, where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit. I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right, and I see the face of America. And it is divine. Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars. So which one, ""A"" or ""B""? I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, ""Barney Stinson, come on down!"" Yeah, of course. Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax. Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready? (he turnst he wheel) Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined! Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father. That's right. My father... is Bob Barker. That's right That's Pops. Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why. Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine? Want to play some catch, Pop? So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am. Why is this so hard for you people to believe? Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones. Nooo. Oh, my God! Thanks, Da... Bob. Um... Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob. Thank you, Bob. $1 billion. So, I brought some photos that I thought you might like to see. This is me on my first birthday. No, no, I want you to see this. This is great. $999. I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel is the only weak part of my game. Did you just... I'm ready, Bob. Thank you, would you, would you say you're proud of me? Please, no car and an above-ground spa? Pass. Overbid! Oh, I love this. Please, please. Please. Let me. 1-8-4-2-1. $14,628. Before, before we wrap up the show, there's just something I want to say to you.... Congratulations on 35 wonderful years hosting The Price Is Right. Have your pets spayed or neutered. Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it. Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again!"
552,2,20,barney's mom," Oh, I don't know. That guy. (she shows him Bob Barker on TV)"
553,2,20,bob ,"Rich, what is the name of our next participant? Working his way out. High-five here, high-five there. A big old hug here. Welcome to contestant's row, Barney. Nice suit.

And the clock will start with your first bid. Lower. Yes, Barney. This is... That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding. Keep bidding.

Millie, he has passed this showcase to you. What do you bid on it? $17,640. Now, let's see Showcase #2. Barney, your showcase begins with a mystery. Barney, you have seen your showcase. What do you bid on it? And the actual retail price of your showcase is... $14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... $18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney. Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet... Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you..."

I'm a fairy princess! (she raises her arms and the dress falls.) I'm too skinny for my dress! Oh, crap. It's $300 just to take the bust in? Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me. I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress. I lost all this weight without even trying. Hello? She called me a bitch and hung up. Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just have to pay the $300. Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate soufflée with a raspberry brandy sauce topped with caramelized bananas and hazelnut gelato. Done! I love you, too. I know it's soon to say it, but I'm so glad you did. Hey. The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker? This is the best wedding diet ever. I lost a pound. I knew that Super Size Me guy was full of it. I can't. I'm trying. Okay! Are you just going to talk about holding my hand or are you going to hold it? I give up, too. I don't care if my dress doesn't fit. I can't eat anymore. I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode. God, I missed you. Sure, baby. Ugh, terribly. I'm too stressed out without you around."
555,2,20,marshall ,"I'm sorry, baby. I ate a bunch of ice cream earlier today. Oh, I'll come with you. Just because we like spending time together doesn't mean we're codependent. Okay, we decided not to do that because of... Frickin' logistics, man. They mess everything up. Sure we could. Okay, let's do it. I'm gonna go grab a beer. Oh, you didn't. That's right. You know what, Barney? Lily and I are a lot less chees than you make us out to be. No. Did you memorize our registry? Training? For what? No way! Whoa, that is so awesome. That's fantastic. Oh, crap. Are you crazy? You cannot tell that story at my wedding. My entire family's gonna be there. My little cousins, my mom, my grandma, my grandpa the minister. His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted. I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance. What was that? I'm all ears. Hello, everyone, Nice. I love you. Yeah. Ted leaves the room. So here's what you want to talk about in front of my entire family: drinking, having a girl in my room, eating junk food. Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's not important. Also, so Lily's never heard that story before. How's she going to react when she finds out the first time I said ""I love you"" to her, I was actually saying it to you and a bag of Funyuns Hey, Lil. What are you talking about? Oh, wow, that was pretty close. Finally. Still strong, right? Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents for teaching me good values. You know what I'd like to do to you right now? I'd like to hold your hand. I'd like to hold your hand so hard that you're not able to shake hands for a week. That's the worst toast I've ever heard, dude. It's totally boring. I know. Going to the bathroom. Sleepwalking? Robbing us? I can't sleep without you. Hey, baby? Would you be the big spoon for a while? How's the weight gaining going? Well, I'm here now. Um, I thought since we're going to be apart for two whole weeks, I would sing you your night-night song. Night-night, Lily Night-night, Lily It's time to go to bed, oh, my silly, little Lily Time to rest your little head Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Come on, Ted. You promised."

558,2,20,robin ,"Then why don't you? You can stay with me. Okay, now I have to wash up for two reasons. Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right. Ta-da-da-da-da... Wow, Lily, you look so beautiful. What happened? Pay the $300? Lily, are you crazy? This isn't a problem. It's a license to eat. Look, what have you always wanted to eat but didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent? I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos. Barney? Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father? Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there. That is impossible. You ate McDonald's every meal for three days. Well, it must be the wedding stress. We just got to up the intake. Lily Aldrin, drop and give me 20 bites of fudge! Okay? Don't nibble at it. Attack it! Come on, Lily. You can do better than that! Well, eat faster, before your body figures out it's full. Oh, are you gonna cry? You gonna cry? Skinny little baby's gonna cry? Well, eat, damn it, eat! Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us you don't need alcohol to have fun."
559,2,20,ted ,"Oh, really? What about the other day? You didn't do it because you couldn't do it. Long story. I'll tell you later. Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on. What?! Here goes. Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Strong opening, right? When Marshall graduates this spring, he'll be a lawyer. But did you know that Marshall has a criminal record? That's right, on a road trip up to Cape Cod, Marshall was pulled over for driving by himself in a car pool lane. That grandpa died three years ago. Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again? Okay, think you're gonna be happy with my new toast. There's nothing sexual. It's, uh, it's just the story of an important moment in your relationship. I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Right? That's great. Back when we were all freshman and Marshall and Lily were just a few short weeks into their relationship... It was 4:00 in the morning, and I'm not gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted. We were starving. So I'd gone out to get us some snacks, and when I got back... Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food? But who cares? You did love her. And you still do. And you're totally over Funyuns, so it's not weird. Hey? That's it? Well, you guys have been spending the last few nights apart. I figured there'd be a lot of giggling, crying, jumping up and down, and then whatever Lily would do What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal? Your father? Your dad... is Bob Barker? You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television? Hey, so I think I figured out how to do your toast in a completely appropriate way. Yeah. Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Great, yeah. I'd like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall when Marshall and Lily got back together. Afterward, we stayed up till 10:00 at night, doing shots of chocolate milk. Man, I'm well nourished right now! Now, I wasn't supposed to hear this next part, but Marshall leaned over to Lily and whispered. Then a little later, Robin caught them... Oh, um......holding hands. End flashback. It was a lovely and responsible night. To Marshall and Lily. Exactly. It's impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me, man. I give up. I'm just going to read that thing about Jesus and the footprints. And so, Lily and I were both about to give up, but as you can all see, Lily does look beautiful in that dress, and here I am giving a toast. You know, all this time, I'd been wracking my brain trying to pick out the perfect moment to capture Lily and Marshall as a couple. But then I realized the perfect moment wasn't some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together. The perfect Lily and Marshall moment happened two nights ago. Marshall, what are you doing? In the hall? You're wide awake. Dude. Turns out, all week long he'd been sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd, to meet Lily. Why didn't you tell him? Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice. No, it's weird. Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la"
560,2,20,tes ,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you suggesting that when one of you feels something, the other feels it, too? Oh, God, you guys are so codependent."
561,2,20,,"Ted (2030): When the marriage approched, some weird stuff started happening. Ted (2030): Then Lily headed out to Robin's for her first night away from Marshall. Ted(2030): Meanwhile, I was testing out my best man toast on Marshall. Ted (2030): Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all. Barney(in front oft he tv):Look, Dad, I got straight A's! Ted(giving the toast): And so Lily and Marshall failed in their experiment with apartness, but they succeeded in getting Lily into her dress. You know, there really are a million things I could tell you about Lily and Marshall, but really, the only thing you need to know is that ten years into their relationship, they still couldn't spend a single night apart. May they never have to again. To Lily and Marshall. Ted (2030): Now, kids, the story of Lily and Marshall's wedding is a good one. No matter how perfectly you plan your... You know, wait a second, guys. I'll get to that. First, I've got to tell you what happened with Barney. At the apartment, all: Oh, my God! At the apartment, Barney: Yeah, I know, the camera loves me. At the apartment, Lily: So, was it $1,350? At the apartment, Barney: I don't know. Was it? At the apartment, Barney: Happy wedding. At the apartment, Ted: What are you doing? At the apartment, Barney: Uh, spending some quality time with my dad. At the apartment, Barney: Happy wedding again! At the apartement, Lily: Oh, my... At the apartment, Ted: Oh, no, you spun it too hard. At the apartment, Robin: No, he didn't spin it hard enough. At the apartment, Ted: That was kind of a weird moment. At the apartment, Robin: I can't believe how excited I am right now At the apartment, Marshall: I don't even know what we're going to do with a dune buggy, but I want it! Ted (2030): And that's the story of how Uncle Barney gave Lily and Marshall a dune buggy for their wedding."
562,2,21,andrea ,"Hi, Lily. Yeah. Oh, I don't really-- I can only reach about half the strings. Yeah. I've been studying the harp for 12 years. Tuesday. Last Tuesday. Just FYI: my water broke. But I can probably......make it through."
563,2,21,barman ,"No. I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception. I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy. And I need you to get out of my face. You got it. I don't have any, but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some."
564,2,21,barney ,"And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony. Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, ""I do."" Yeah. Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross ""harp player"" off my list. Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass. Sweet! I can cross off two things. Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick? Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy. You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy. Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? ""Hey, baby, want to pluck?"" Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill? Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar. Uh... Don't think they do that anymore. He kind of did. I'll get it. He's great. He's about to get his hair cut. Me, too. I was up all night. Hey, Bill. I need a glass of wine. It's for the bride, so... White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda. She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds. Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin. Here. Can't stay. Got to try something. Hey. Can I have your phone number? It's for the bride. The bride wants you to walk slower. Well, it's not too short. You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys. Ah, let me see what I can do. I have a superpower. Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two? The bride needs this. To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it. It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation. Yes. Yes, I can. Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something: your jaws-- because Barney Stinson is about to aid and abet a marriage. Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other. No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something? It's totally okay. Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward? I can't From this day forward so as long as you both shall live? Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to be your husband to have and to hold... live? Okay, then, by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride."
565,2,21,ben ,"Yes. Yeah. Oh, no! Yeah, that would probably work, but with what? That's a tough one. Mm, yeah. Does anyone here wear a toupee? (Ben's wearing a toupee) Shouldn't be hard to find out. Most of them are pretty bad. Boy, that's a pretty tall order. No, not off the top of my... No. Can't."
566,2,21,bill ,"Can I ask you something? Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects? Oh, so when do you think someone should do it? Just wait for a lull or what?"
567,2,21,brad ,"Barney said you needed me to bounce some guy named Scooter? What's up with Bill? I'm on it. Hey. Funny story. I tackled this guy I thought was Scooter. Turns out it was your photographer. Don't worry. I got this sweet camera phone, so we're covered. Hey. Cool hair, bro. I got sauce on it when I tackled the caterer. No, I'm good. Hey, you guys seen Scooter? Not for long, bro. Not for long."
568,2,21,cousin ,"Oh, no, we don't even have to cut it at all. Could just give it some style. Ooh, I could give you some cool guy tips."
569,2,21,lily ,"Yeah. It's just how I always pictured it. So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle. Great. Now my mom's making me invite the Lessners. This puts our numbers in the triple digits. So it's not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore. Marshall's dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in New York, he's going to get mugged, so it's going to be inside now. It'll be great. We're still going to have our acoustic guitar player. So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp. Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant. Wow. Andrea. You really are pregnant. Robin, it's fine. So, so, when are you due? Wow, that's soon. Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, ""Oh, my wedding has to be perfect."" Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional. Bill? Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed? That's Scooter. His real name is Bill. My mom must have invited him. Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine. Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing? Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short. Scooter, what are you doing here? You're really cute. Oh, no. Really? I want... I want... Scooter! Oh. Robin... My makeup looks perfect right now, and I'm about to cry. Do something. Really? Robin, stop. Stop. It's okay. I am not gonna let anything get to me today. I'm okay. I'm fine. Totally cool. Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on. I'm marrying Marshall today. So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil in a room that has no flowers to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning, as my high school boyfriend reads g*ns N' Roses lyrics. But that's okay, because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway. What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay! Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has! It's ruined! Oh, grow up, Robin! Of course I want a perfect wedding! Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but... I do. I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today. What could you have that could possibly make me feel better? God, I hope Marshall's having a better day than I'm having. Oh, my God! Marshall... What happened? Did Amy do this to you? Oh, no, you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie. It was already ruined. There's no flowers, no photographer. Oh, and Scooter's here, by the way. My veil got thrashed, the harp player is in labor, and I'm not wearing my wedding underwear. What happened? Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony? I love it. Great. Wait, hold on. Excuse me, sir. Could we borrow your hat? Thank you. I don't have mine either. My turn. Oh, thank you. Marshall, I love you because you're funny and you make me feel loved and you make me feel safe and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says, ""Lily and Marshall. Rockin' It Since '96."" I kinda wish I was wearing it right now 'cause it smells like you. But the main reason I love you, Marshall Ericksen, is you make me happy. You make me happy all the time. I'm good. Slow down. I do. No. Tired. I got married twice today. What do you think? Bathroom, of course."
570,2,21,man ,"I hate to bother you, but... I think I found your veil in the parking lot. Okay."
571,2,21,marshall ,"You know what? That's okay. It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding. How long is this list? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys! Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?! Lily's cousin is in beauty school, and Lily didn't want her to do her hair, so she said she could do mine. So, um, just not-not too short, okay? Oh, okay, yeah, that's great. 'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird. And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know. I don't think I need advice on how to be cool, but yeah, great, lay that on me. I can't get married like this! There's no way! Lily is gonna k*ll me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this. Would you marry me? Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married? Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?! You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo. Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something! No! Actually, I think it kinda works. Barney? Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it? Oh, you know... What? What? Scooter's here? That guy's at my wedding? Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay? Oh, no. Lily, you're not supposed to see me. Just the frosted tips. I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby. I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I? Yeah, I know. I heard. What? No ""Property of Marshall"" across the back? How are people going to know whose butt that is? I wish we could have that wedding. What? Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there? What do you think, baby? Me, too. Let's do it. Let's get married before we get married. Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat. Oh, no. I don't have my vows. Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick. You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called ""Eggs Marshall,"" and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy. I do. Did you smoke? How do you feel? So where do you want to do it for the first time as a married couple, nice hotel room or a reception hall bathroom?"
572,2,21,marshall and lily," Sorry, Ted."
573,2,21,robin ,"Wow, it's beautiful, Lily. But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony? Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more. How do you play the harp with your belly so...? You only play half the harp? Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn? Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of ""Guitar Hero""? Learned that in a day. Is there a ""Harp Hero""? Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony. Really? That didn't work. Your high school boyfriend, Scooter? Why? Why would she do that? That is a good song. That's Scooter. Oh, wow. I have hairy nipples. No, but it worked, didn't it? There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call... Oh, no. Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry. Are you sure? Lily, are you okay? What happened to ""I don't want a perfect wedding""? And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better. Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you. Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here. He's gonna cry. Hey, I found your panties! Wow. First lie of marriage. That was fast."
574,2,21,scooter ,"Hello, Lily. Hey, Barney. It's not ""Scooter"" anymore. It's Bill. A lot of things have changed about me, Lily, but one hasn't. I still love you. And I came here to win you back. Maybe my words won't change your mind, but maybe the words of a poet will. I read from ""November Rain."" By W. Axl Rose."
575,2,21,ted ,"Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie? What? The good Backstreet Boys? What-what the hell happened to you? What? What can you do? That's crazy. Of course she will. No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule: never marry anyone you've had a farting contest with. Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution. What?! Dude, those guys are criminals. Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these. Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right? Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out. Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head. Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area? Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair. Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you? Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee. It totally does. It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot. In a bad way. What happened to your shirt? You gonna put another shirt on? Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress. So do it. Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate. You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other. No problem. Please don't."
576,2,21,woman ,Hey. No. Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen. I just got a call from the florist. The flowers won't be here till halfway through the ceremony.
577,2,21,,"Ted (2030): In May of 2007, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall got married at the historic Van Smoot House in upstate New York. Ted (2030): The closer you get to the big day, the more concessions you make. Ted (2030): And the day arrives for Lily and Marshall's very big indoor wedding... with a harp. Ted (2030): After that, we all went back inside for the second wedding. And yes, a lot of things did go wrong, but it didn't matter because when I look back on that day, what I remember is the first wedding; the intimate outdoor ceremony with just close friends and an acoustic guitar."
578,2,22,barney ,"Tell people what? Tell people what? Tell people what? Oh, okay. Tell people what? Absolutely. Tell people what? Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what? Okay. (Barney leaves) Tell people what? Fine. Oh, my God, just tell me! What list? Oh, like First Corinthians? That Bible verse? They do that at every wedding. Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something, so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great. Are those mini quiches? (Marshall and Lily run) Tell the secret. Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew. Maybe in your life-- I got a lot of stuff going on. Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away.(Lily and Marshall leave) So what was in the glass? You said that already! Don't get married. An engagement ring?No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do So what happened next? Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it. Run? Your strategy was run? No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina. The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years, the government is opposed to free market reforms, and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium. Man, she was chatty. You caught the bouquet? That's when you run. Tell me you ran, Ted. No. No. Robin, you're not... No, say the story's not over. Say the story's not over! Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried I've ever been that someone's pregnant. Getting married, having kids. It's all a mistake. It's a horrible, horrible mistake. You did break up. You're not pregnant? An-And Marshall and Lily don't know? You guys okay? I'm really sorry about you and Robin. I know I was always joking around about wanting you two to break up, but you were really good together. The one. Oh, Ted, no. Do not tell me you're going to start searching for ""the one"" again. The only time I want to hear you saying ""the one"" is if it's followed by the word ""hundredth."" What up? Really? 'Cause... you know, you've been in a relationship for a year. You're going to... be a little rusty. I'm just saying... you're gonna need, need, need some help out there. Ted? Do you think... Do you think maybe you might... need a wingman again? Yes! Yes! We're back. We are back. And Ted, my boy, it's going to be legend... Wait for it..."
579,2,22,janna ,Yes.
580,2,22,kid ,"Excuse me, Miss. Could I have this dance?"
581,2,22,lily ,"Does it make you kind of sad that we don't share the same last name? You know what we should do? We should come up with a whole new last name. Lily and Marshall Hasselhoff. Yeah. I love you, Mr. Awesome. Oh, help us. We're starving. We planned this amazing meal with the caterers, and we haven't had a bite of it. Thanks, Grammie, but we really need to... Oh, yes, definitely. Oh, that's great. Going on the list. Horrible wedding clichées we're not going to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole. Going on the list. We've done it. A wedding with zero clichées. Well, okay, one clichée. No! They cleared our plates again! Well, you still have me. No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well... Mini quiche. You're a mega-douche. I had four strawberries. Yes. Oh, look, more strawberries! No, it's going to be so funny. Whoopsy-daisy. We love you. I love you."
582,2,22,lily's grandma," Oh, there you are. My dear, you look so beautiful.  And you... you look like a 1940s movie star.  We will see you on the floor for the conga line later, won't we?"
583,2,22,man ,"Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever Mr. and Marshall Eriksen and Lily Aldrin. Why don't I come back. It's mine. Janna... will you marry me? All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're all gather around, Lily and Marshall are going to cut the cake. God, this guy's giving me nothing. Welcome to Wienerburger. Let me guess. Jefferson High prom? Wow. Congratulations. That's $7.80. Hey, dude. I don't know how to say this, but your wife just threw up in the trash."
584,2,22,marshall ,"You know, in a totally evolved 21st-century kind of way yeah, a little. Oh, that's easy-- Lily and Marshall Skywalker. I got it. You ready? You ready? Lily and Marshall Awesome. Have you met the Awesomes? Marshall, Lily, their son, Totally and their daughter, Freakin'? I love you, Mrs. Awesome. Every time we get near the food, we get cocktail weiner blocked. We haven't eaten all day. And you look like a pepper-crusted rack of lamb with mint jelly. ""Love is patient and kind. ""Love does not envy or boast. ""It is not arrogant or rude. ""Love does not insist on it's own way. ""It is not irritable or resentful. ""Love bears all things, ""believes all things, ""hopes all things... ""endures all things."" Well, technically two. Pepper-crusted rack of lamb, where did you go? It's my wedding night. I was supposed to have my way with you. Yeah... Hey, Stinson. Never lie to a man about a chocolate fountain. Lily, you could have burped or said the word ""Yes,"" but the fact that you did both is exactly why I married you. Okay, Lily. I'm really hungry, so let's just, uh, aim for my mouth, okay? Besides, the smearing the cake thing's a clichée, remember? Lily. Lily, just feed me the cake. Please, baby, I am so hungry. (Lily's so drunk that she falls) And she's okay. She's all right. That was funny. And it's time for the honeymoon. Guys, guys, guys. Thank you so much. Nessie's a she, Ted, come on. Marshall and Lily leave. This is by far the drunkest I've ever seen you. Uh, driver. Ranjit!! Hey, can we make a stop before we head back to the hotel? Um, no, we actually had something else in mind. Lily, go sit down. Hi. Can we get a number one, please, with no pickles? And a number four with no onions. No. But thank you. Actually, we just got married. Thank you. Yeah. My wife..."
585,2,22,ranjit ,"Hello! You do not have to stop. You can be together as man and wife right back there, and because we are friends... I will not watch. Okay."
586,2,22,robin ,"So... Yes, it is. Hi, Barney. Nothing. Hi. Have you met Barney? Think he'll actually let it go? Can I get a water please? Oh, God! Okay. Look, we have some... news. So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon. What's wrong? All right, let's run some interference. All right, let's get these two back to their table. Conga line. How's it go? Lame. Okay, so we're sitting there and the waiter comes over... Um, we didn't order champagne. And there, sitting at the bottom of my champagne glass is... Is an engagement ring. No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no. This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here. What? Then whose is it? Wow. That was hilarious. I was like... what? Anyway. What the hell was what? I thought you were proposing to me. Ted, you know how I feel about marriage. I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight? Then why is this an issue? Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go? So did you guys find anything to eat? Ted, don't do this. Where do you see yourself? And I probably want to be in Argentina. Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure. Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home? Yeah? And how did that work out for you? Well, come on, Ted, can you blame them? Argentina. Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there. No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does. So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina? Oh, shut up. Aren't you? Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina. Right? Right? Wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't know if I can do this to you. Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids. You know what I mean. Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies. Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to start having babies right this second. Do you have a...? Well, we probably shouldn't. Risk it? Come on, they're cutting the cake. Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again. That tuckered me out. Right. Okay, let me just go change, and we'll leave. That is crazy. I have a change of clothes and you don't. Suck it up. Yeah. We were all talk, weren't we? I don't want to have kids in Argentina. So where does that leave us? You stole a blue French horn for me. Nope. We decided not to say anything till after the wedding. But we're okay. Hi."
587,2,22,ted ,"So... Wedding's over. I guess starting tomorrow, we can tell people. The food looks delicious, doesn't it? Can we talk about this later? Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney? Whoo, that was a close one. But we don't want to draw attention away from Lily and Marshall's big day. It's pretty big, though. Yeah, we'll get you back to your table. Come on. How about a slide show of you guys through the years set to Green Day's ""Time of Your Life"" and ending with your baby photos side by side. Wait, isn't doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a clichée? Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin? What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives. Wow. Thanks. Cheers. Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, ""Champagne?"" ""We didn't order any champagne."" ""Compliments of the house."" ""Wow."" Right. So Robin looks down, and there at the bottom of her glass... That's what she said. What are you talking about? That's not mine. That's not mine. What the hell was that? That reaction? Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire. Now more than ever. No. Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, ""No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. ""Ted, you cannot do this to me. ""No. No, no, no."" No. Was there a side of champagne with each of the strawberries? No, seriously. Where do you see yourself in five years? Honestly, in five years... I probably want to be married. Argentina? We have an expiration date, don't we? Barney... story's not over. Yeah, of course. Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this. Can we actually... Wha... what? Run! It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it. I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license till we bring the horn back. Look, I'm sorry about the French horn. I want to make this right. So what we're going to do right now is, we're going to run! So... Argentina. Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina? I could want to live in Argentina. Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too. They have buildings in Argentina. And Paris. And even Tokyo. I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents. Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina. You're scared I might not be kidding. Nope. Your move, Scherbatsky. Barney. The story's not over yet. What? Do what? Oh, right. 'Cause there are no kids there. On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black ""X"" over Argentina. No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect. Yeah. Risk it. All right, have fun in Scotland. If you see the Loch Ness Monster, tell him Ted Mosby says, ""What's up?"" Hey, kiddo. The story's not over, Barney. Okay, time to get the horn back to the bistro. Not a euphemism. Whoa, whoa, you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh. Solidarity, sister. Well, if we'd actually moved in together, all my stuff would be here, but we didn't, so... We're not doing this, are we? And I don't want to have kids in Argentina. Well... we could stay together and... pretend this stuff doesn't matter. Or... we could give back the blue French horn. I would have stolen you a whole orchestra. Yep. Well, afterwards, uh, we came by to tell you guys, but Lily was pretty stressed out, so... Well, it hasn't been the easiest two weeks of our lives, but... The open bar helps. Well, we knew this day would come eventually. Take care of her, little man. Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know? No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know? Yeah. Could be. Yes, Barney. I do."
588,2,22,waiter ,"Champagne? Compliments of the house. Oh, my God, it's you. You're the son of a bitch who stole our blue French horn."
589,2,22,,"Ted(2030): The answer to that one was decided weeks earlier. Man( with a camera): Anything you want to say to the bride and groom? Ted (2030): So Marshall and Lily were married, and Robin and I were broken up. And as hard as it was at the time, in the end we both got what we wanted. She did eventually go on to live in Argentina and Morocco and Greece, Russia, even Japan for a little while. And I... well, I met your mom. I think for the most part if you're really honest with yourself about what you want out of life, Of course, at that moment, all I really wanted was a scotch and soda and a cigar."
590,3,1,amy ,"Amy. Who's the suit? Oh, well. You can check out off 08:54, dress up like a dork and bother the cool kids. Beat it, nerd. Tell me something. Do you ask your tailor to leave extra room in the crotch for your huge v*g1n*? Good idea. Let's all go back to my place. I have a hot tub. Thanks. You can play with them if you want. They're a hundred percent real. Oh, thanks. You should get one. Yeah? Well. I think he would look hot with some ink. Yes, he would. Yuh-huh. Yeah, you would. Oh my God, Tyler? Damn it! They're supposed to be in the Hamptons. Run! Sorry. I used to nanny for those jerks before they fired me. So unfair. Oh, fire. We should start a fire. Mm, I just broke up with my boyfriend Steve. He was totally annoying. He was like, ""I think you're the one, I want to marry you."" Yeah. Sure, I mean, we're still friends, right Steve?"
591,3,1,amy's friend, Want to have s*x?
592,3,1,barney ,"When will you be ready? Ted Mosby, suit up, 'cause here's the plan. There's a Miss Nassau County pageant. We'll pretend to be judges and, yes, our votes are for sale. Finish line of a woman 10K. Salty girls on an endorphin high who just want to lie down. Yeah. Female acrobats from Montreal. Super flexible. We're going to get ""Cirque de So-Laid"". What up? Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name? Kyle? That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner. How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me. Not possible. You cannot have s*x on a windsurfing board. Glad you asked Lily. I have crafted a list of every vehicle land-based, aquatic and airborne in which/on which it's possible to have s*x. And of those 33 vehicles, I have had s*x in/on 31. Windsurfing board, not on the list, not possible. Oh, P.S., in order to hit 33, all I need is bobsled and the Apollo 11 space capsule. This conversation never happened. Yes! Hum-hum. Not for long. Okay, pep talk. Take a knee. Ted, tonight, we're going to get you someone way hotter than Robin. Okay, Robin's a ten. Fine we'll get you a 12. Or, you know... two sixes. Failing that, four threes. And break glass in case of emergency we'll go the Staten Island, I'll get you 12 ones. Ted, my boy, I'm going to re-teach you... Ah. Barney. Ted, we are back. Up here. Up high. Fivin' it up five-style! Ted. Ted. Ted. Ted. Ted. Let's bail, this place is dead. Yes, exactly, plus, we're on a tight schedule. I've got the entire evening perfectly planned out... Spoiler alert: Our last stop is an after hours club so after hours, it's three days from now. What up? Yeah. But I didn't get to help. Apology accepted. Let's go. I'm not gonna remember that. Now, if you'll excuse me, random chick from earlier tonight, as you shall henceforth be known. Ted and I have a schedule to keep. Wow. Wow. Great stuff, Tommy Lee. See what you don't understand is, I'm Ted wingman. It's a sacred bond, much stronger that any... They're making out again! They know us here! You're gonna get us in trouble. You... your v*g1n*... Ted, this chick is crazy. We're leaving. Your place? Thanks, but no thanks, 1994 Courtney Love. Okay, this place is actually pretty nice. Wrong. Ted has a classic clean-cut look that never goes out of style season after season, burn. No, he wouldn't. No, he wouldn't. Nuh-uh. Ted. Who are you gonna side with on this tattoos thing? Unfair? I wouldn't let you take care of the imaginary kids I make up to score with single moms. That's it Ted, we're going home. Ted? Ted, you okay? You're not getting a tattoo. It's not you. Ted, you are heading down a dark path. But you need a plan and you need a wingman! This is so going in my blog! Okay. Hey, guys, what's the big emergency? Oh and B the W: I am never speaking to Ted again. What? Ted? I came here this morning because... I want to apologize. See. All this time, I thought you need a wingman to fly, but the truth is you... you've got your own wings now. Since you and Robin split, you've been gestating. Growing in your cocoon. And last night... you burst out of that cocoon..., like a majestic, uh... gosh, what is it that comes out of a cocoon? I was always bad at science. Nothing, buddy. Oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp. You know, a ho tat. Ass antlers. A Panama City license plate. Oh, yeah, that'll get it out. Go for Barney. What is it? What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...? No. (screams) No!"
593,3,1,gael ,"Hola. Gael. Gael. Gael. It's means ""joyful"". That is why I live my life by bringing joy, good energy and happiness to others. Especially those less fortunate that I. With a massage everything is connected. I can touch your foot cleanse your kidney. I can touch your earlobe and slow your heartbeat. Career? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time. And then we fell asleep on the beach while counting the stars. I hate to see you so tense. (Begins massaging her) I mean, we had a really clean break up, you know? We really acted like adults, so the last thing... Oh! Oh, God, oh! What? I train for three years at an institute in Buenos Aires. I have a card. I can show you. What do you mean ""laminated""? Oh, yes. We carry so much ancient emotion in our neck and shoulders. Things we should have let go of years ago. Hello, Ted. Robin and I are about to make fantastic aquatic s*x on this windsurfing board. I think your leg goes up, up... No, mine... Feel the emotions release. You're beautiful. Experience your food. Try the mango. Okay, that's enough of the fruit."
594,3,1,lily ,"Robin! What do you mean ""Win the breakup"", old timey inventor. It's not a competition. Now, your 80-day ballon race around the world, that was a competition. How do you know? To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian. Oh, for the hundredth time, I'm sorry, there was a lull. Do you want to have diner with me? Uh, us? No, I don't!...Not incredibly. It's a little hard to believe how hot is he. But I mean, she isn't serious about him. The girl never marries the hot guy. I'm one of the lucky few. Hey, Robin. (Looks down) Gael. I do not! Shut up! Oh, my God! Oh, I forgive you, Mom. Oh, yeah, that's what I was doing. I was building him up so few minutes later, I could totally cut him down. Look. We've gotta call Barney. Hum. Really, never? Not even if, say, butterflies flew out of his ass? He's gonna say it. It meant nothing to us. It just felt really really really good. He got a tramp stamp. (Everyone laughs)"
595,3,1,marshall ,"What our 21st president, Chester A. Arthur, is trying to say is that in every breakup there are winners and losers. That's my wife. Girl? There was no lull. You just think he's incredibly hot. Well, you did. Lily, Ted is our best friend, so let's get something straight: Male Gayle is not hot. He's not our friend. Don't even look at him. Just... no eye contact. Weird? Why would it be weird? Because you used to date our best friend or because my wife thinks your new boyfriend is incredibly hot? Hmm. Gael, are you properly licensed massage therapist? Are you legally certified by some type of gouverning entity? Is the card laminated? Covered in protective plastic. Damn it! (To Lily) He checks out... Massage therapist. And you know what, ""Gayle""? Your piece of chicken looks a little tense to me. Oh, oh, does that feel good, Mr. Chicken? Well, guess what? I didn't wash my hands. Got him. Lily?! Lily, we are Ted's best friends. Our job is to hate that guy. Weren't you wearing a bra? Hey, buddy, how was your night? Oh my God! Nothing. This J. Crew catalog. Who brings two golden retrievers in a canoe? Way ahead of you. Hum. Ted? Could you grab me the fondue pot?  He has no idea. (Barney falls backward) And up we go. Thank you. Maybe you should try club soda. Last night got weird. Think I just got over being chunky in the ninth grade. I am beautiful. We're sorry, Ted. It'll never happen again. Ted. Hey, man. It's Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something. Just a new website. Slapcountdown.com."
596,3,1,narrator ,"Kids, there's more than one story of how I met your mother. (Cut to a yellow umbrella floating down a street) You know the short version, the thing with your mom's yellow umbrella. But there's a bigger story. The story of how I became who I had to become before I could meet her. And that story begins here. It was a good question. (Flashback of Robin and Ted hugging after breaking up) After a big relationship ends, you need some time to recuperate. Robin took a trip to Argentina, and I went through my usual routine. (End Flashback) I grew my breakup beard. I repainted the apartment. And the truth is, I was doing really good. So that night, as Lily and Marshall did their best to hate Gael... The night was doing great. Amy was cool and dangerous. She found a friend for Barney. She even paid for drinks... (Amy steals liquor from behind the bar) sort of. And that's all I remember. (Ted wakes up) The next morning, I woke up alone back home. (He doesn't have a tattoo anywhere on his arms or his chest. He sighs, relieved. As he leaves the room, we see the butterfly tattoo across his lower back) And suddenly it all came back to me."
597,3,1,narrtor ,"Kids, I can't remember exactly what helped me get through the whole Robin-Gael incident. I'm sure it was something profound and meaningful and not at all macho and petty. But after that, I was back on my feet. And what followed was a new era in my life. A crazy time unlike anything that came before. (The camera goes outside to show a sea of black umbrellas, and one yellow one walking through the crowd) It's funny looking back on those days, knowing now exactly what I was heading towards, and what was heading towards me."
598,3,1,robin ,"Hey, guys. I just got in last night. Um, uh, this is Gael. It's pronounced ""guy-el"". I just want to make sure you're okay with this. I just hope Ted's okay. And I just want to make sure you're okay with this. (Both laugh) Okay, how do we do this? Okay, how 'bout if I, um... Okay. If you feel like you need to do that, then... You shaved. I like the beard. I know it was weird showing up with Gael. I'm sorry. Over it? My first three days in Argentina, I cried my eyes out. I missed you so much. I wanted to go and prove how adventurous I am, but the truth is, it was really lonely. And that's why Gael happened. I was trying to survive it. He's not an Adonis. He's not perfect. ""You're bigger"". No, Ted... ""you're bigger""."
599,3,1,ted ,"I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. Barney, come on, we've covered this. Okay, I'm ready. I just can't believe her. (He walks into the room with only his chin shaved) We have this totally amicable split, everything's cool. And she comes back from vacation with THAT guy? You know what she's doing? She's trying to win the breakup. I'm sorry, Gayle? I'm sorry. So it's Gayle?  What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent. And, oh, he is a masseuse. One time I used warm water to make a guy pee. Of course, I didn't make a career out of it. All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing. You guys, have fun of your duble date. ""I just want to make sure you're okay with this""? Damn it! I can't believe she's the one that gest to say that. She's winning, isn't she? Ted. What?!! Yeah, you're right. We're both totally striking out. Are you blind? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning. So you're saying you want me to throw away a super hot girl just because you didn't help me get her? Hum. This is Barney. Barney, Amy. I like your tatts. No, your tatts... toos. Your tattoos. I think I'd look way hot with some ink. Yeah. I'm okay. In fact, here's how okay I am. I'm gettin' a tattoo. That dark path is my driveway. After this maybe. Oh, man, this is going to be legen... wait for it... You know, it was great. I met this crazy girl, I almost got a tattoo. Don't worry, I didn't. But it was... It was amazing. I think it's safe to say, I am winning this breakup. What? Hum. Hum. What? Hmm? Apology accepted, Barney. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter. Hmm. A butterfly? (Everyone laughs) What? Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God! (Looks in mirror) I have a tattoo. Tramp stamp? What a wuss. Do you think exes can be friends? Hey, your name is Steve. And her ex-boyfriend's name is Steve. What are the odds of that...? Wait. No no no no no no no. Give me this. Oh, damn it, it really hurts. I need like, some ointment or something. What is this? Spanish massage oil. Spanish massage oil? What happened here last night? I can't even look at you two right now. Good. Now, here's the thing. It sucks that you came back from Argentina with someone as awesome as Gael. And I know I have no right to be upset at you. We're broken up, life goes on, whatever. But you know what? We-we never did this. We-we had this polite breakup with no irrational yelling and that's just wrong. So I'm gonna yell irrationally for a while and you're just gonna have to stand there and deal with it, okay?  I think I do! I really think I do! So now, I'm yelling!  I did.  I liked it too, but it was getting kind of hot. Maybe in the winter, I'll grow it back out! (quietly) Okay, I'm done. Look, us breaking up, it was the right thing. But it took some time to get over you, you know? I-I'm still getting over you. But you, you were over it the minute they started the in-flight movie. You weren't trying to win the break-up? Okay. No. See, look, that all sounds good, and we'll still be friends and move on, but..., did he have to be so hot? The guy's an Adonis. He's the Cadillac of rebound guys. Marshall has a crush on him. The guy's perfect. Oh, come on. He's hot, he windsurfs, he massages things. Name one way I'm better than that guy. Don't patronize me. If anything, he may even be a little bit taller."
600,3,1,the girl, I'm ready to do anything you want by the way. Anything. Right now.
601,3,1,tyler ,Mommy! Daddy! She's back.
602,3,1,,"Barney:...Dary! Legendary! Dude, I am so excited that you're single again. We're going to conquer New York City. I already have a girl from work lined up for you. Right boob bigger than the left boob, which some choose to look at as bra half empty. I choose to look at as bra half full. Narrator:...Robin pulled me aside to check in. Now, I'm sure, she meant the best, but she said the worst. [The Apartment - Robin/Gael/Marshall/Lily]Robin: I'm sorry this is all so weird. [The Tattoo parlor - Ted/Amy/A guy]Ted: And underneath, it should say ""I win"". And then it should have flames coming out the bottom. [Flashback: Tattoo parlor]Ted:...Dary. Legendary! Man, I am so winning this breakup. [The hallway outside Robin's Apartment - Ted/Robin]Ted: All right, first of all, this isn't one of those, ""I came all the way over here because I want you back"" things. There'll be no startling confession of love, no sweet indie rock song that swells up just as we're about to kiss, none of that crap. Got it? [The Bar - Ted/Marshall/Barney]Ted: I win!"
603,3,2,all ,"G'day. All right, we're living, we're leaving, okay. Michael Moore was so right about americans."
604,3,2,barney ,"I think the whole point of getting married was that you didn't have to do that anymore. Whoa. Whoa. What are death folders? Yeah. Wait, why? That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen. No way at all. In fact, I dare God to smite down this perfectly healthy... Whoa. Are you topless? Ted, check this out. You haven't changed, Scherbatsky. You're a sophisticated, scotch-swilling, cigar-smoking, red-meat-eating, gun-toting new yorker. What you are not is a massage-giving, windsurfing, bongo-playing, teetotaling, vegan, peacenik, hippy like you soon to be ex-boyfriend, Gael. Back me up here, Ted. Please, vacation romances have an expiration date. Gael's got a ""Best if banged by"" sticker on him. Once your romance starts to stink, you'll dump his ass down the drain like sour milk and go back to being ""Unevolved Robin"", the one we actually like. Back me up here, Ted. I'm telling you, within three days... Within a triad of solar periods, you'll recognize your dearth of compatibility with your paramour and conclude your association. This is all gonna returns to masticate you in the gluteals. Support my hypotehesis, Ted. That guy... Well. You and me, we have to bend over backwards to get a woman to, well, bend over backwards. But that guy... every woman in the bar is hanging on his every slightly mispronounced word. And why? No. Because he's from out of town. Yeah. Actually... You know where I've been meaning to visit?  Uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies. Hate to bother you. We seem to be a little bit lost. Would you happen to know which street the statue of liberty's on? Oh, it's right. And, thank you very... Uh, my name is, uh, Ignatius Peabody Nobel, from East Westerton, Missouri. And this is my friend... Ted. Hi, Colleen. Hi, Lindsay. Yeah. Well. Hotdog! Should we... you want to just meet here in front of Mac... MacLaren's pub? All right. Okay. All right. This is the easiest date ever. You know what I'm gonna try next? A knock, knock joke. Ted, Ted, Ted. Dude. Right. Stay with me. We are on the cusp of moving from out-of-towners to in-their-pantsers. Ay-o? Nice. (The girls are coming in) Nice. Hey, nice. Knock, knock. Yes, we do. Everything's so bright, even at night. No wonder the city never sleeps. (Barney and Colleen laughing)  Now he knows all the streets. Someone's been watching too many ""Steinfield reruns"". (Woman laughing, Ted laughts sarcastically) Ted. I think these local new yorkers know more about the city than we do, so relax. We're in very capable hands. Well. I only had traveler's checks. What?! This night couldn't have gone any better. We've just survived a mugging. You know what that means. ""Thank God we're alive"" s*x. It's even better than ""I can't believe you just proposed to me"" s*x, which I've only had, like, four of five times. Ted, please, we are so close. Mmm-mm. Me too. So where do you live? Theodore. Teddy? Oh, no.  You're not from Missouri? Well, I will be a monkey's unc... Hey, um, sir, can we get ride, too? Welcome home, Scherbatsky. Listening."
605,3,2,collee ,Yeah.
606,3,2,colleen ,"Hi, um, I'm Colleen. This is Lindsay. No, what is it? It's kind of a lame bar, but sure. We'll see you tomorrow. This is our favorite restaurant in the city. I'm gonna go, too. Yeah. I just want to celebrate the fact that we survived. You know? Close. West Orange. Yep. Yeah. But don't worry, it's pretty much New York. And how would you know? Ew. (To the Policeman) Can we get a ride?"
607,3,2,gael ,"Here. Eat. If we run out of fish I will catch more with my hands. What are we talking of? Baseball? My windsurfing board... it had floated away. And the shark... he was getting closer. They say to escape you punch a shark in the nose. But I said... ""Brother shark, we are both children from the same earth mother."" (Lily sighs) And that's all I remember until the hospital. Here, taste. Experience your food. Here taste. Experience your food. We're alone, now. I must have you. I must have you. Hey. Good news. I made some travelling friends today, and they'll be staying with us. How do you say... indefinetly?! Robin, are you okay?"
608,3,2,lily ,"Yeah. You're writing constantly. There's forms we have to sign, our death folders, thank you notes... It's this thing they recommend you do in case one spouse died unexpectedly. Yeah. Account info, important addresses, a letter to the other person, all that stuff. I'll get the next round. Wow. It seems like a great trip. Wow. There's a lot of nude people in here. Just shoes and a shirt. That's a look. Man, this is like ""Where's Waldo"" of exposed genitalia. Except that it's really easy to find Waldo. Ooh, here he comes. Switched to big words. ""M., Atm Pin Code: 5-4-5-9. Teacher's pension account: a-3-9-3-2. Cancel Vogue. L."" So, Gael, huh? Still going strong? Ooh, that's one too many. What's going on? Well, maybe you're just going back to the person you were before the trip. Wow, it's a really nice blender. I can't. I married you. That's how we got the blender. What's wrong? How can you open my letter? Marshall, wait. (He opens the door) This was our first fight as a married couple. Oh. Yes? Wow. You really want to open this up again. Oh, I forgot, you open everything up, even if you're not supposed to until I'm dead. Because, I can't bear the thought of not being with you, not even for long enough to write you a stupid letter. Yes, really. Plus, I know as soon as I write it, you're just going to open it up and read it again. Okay. I'll write you a letter for my death folder. I tell you what. How about I make it all dirty stuff and slip in a little clean stuff? Okay, I'm done... but I really don't want you reading this unless... you know, something happens. Can you swear to me you won't open it? Marshall, I'm serious. Okay. ""Busted! I knew you'd read this. You suck, Marshall, you totally suck."" Yes, you suck. You said you wouldn't read it and you did. Oh, fine, I'll take the dirty pictures. What is that supposed to mean?"
609,3,2,lindsay ,"Well. We're tonight, but... maybe tomorrow afternoon? Atfer lunch? It's pretty lame. I'm going to run to the restroom. Hey. Our friends invited us to a party. You guys want to come along? Who's there? 148th and Brook Avenue. Wow. I think we all need to go back to our place and recover."
610,3,2,marshall ,"It's the same. Mostly, except I think I might be getting carpal tunnel. My hands keeps cramping up. No, it's from writing all the thank you notes. Mostly. It's all the information your spouse might need all in one convenient location. I am such a jerk. I didn't know that I was supposed to write a letter. All Lily's gonna find in that folder are a bunch of bank statements and a funny list of things to do with my ashes. Number six. Yeah. Oh, God, I am a bad husband. No, uh, no, I'll just write, I'll write Lily a letter tonight, everything'll be fine. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! I get it, okay, you guys know I'm a little superstitious, and you guys are trying to freak me out. Well, guess what? It didn't work. So, there. You guys are jerks! ""My dearest, sweetest, Lily pad. Let this letter be a small beacon, a tiny firefly to help light your way trough the years ahead. My love for you persists, higher than the Himalayas, deeper than a scottish loch. (sobbing) If I died under suspicious circumstances then beware. Trust no one, not even Ted. Especially not Ted. Know that I'll always be there in your heart, whenever you need me. (cry and sobbing) And my love for you will never die. Love. (sobbing) Your Marshmallow."" (cry and inhales sarply) Wow. Both sides. You wrote on both sides of a thank you note to my third cousin for a blender that you haven't even taken out of the box. Well, if you love that blender so much, why don't you just marry it. Nothing. Nothing's wrong. What could be wrong? Except that when you die, I'm gonna find out that your parting words to comfort me for all eternity were ""Cancel Vogue"". That was not a letter. It was barely even a text message. Next time you write something that short, at least have the courtesy to make it rhyme. Oh, baby. Hey, babe. I've been thinking about our fight. I'm really, really... surprised that you haven't apologized to me yet. You know that is important to me. Why won't you just write the letter? Really? Lily, I won't, I promise. Do you mind, um, maybe slipping in a little bit of dirty stuff, too? You're the best. And maybe a couple polaroids? Totally. What does it say? Okay. I promise I won't, I won't open that until you're dead. That's it? I suck. Lily. Well, you didn't keep your promise either. I don't see any dirty pictures in here. I don't want 'em now. What?! Nothing. Nothing. You're beautiful. I would love the photos. Have I told you how beautiful you look?"
611,3,2,narrator ,"Away from her normal home, her normal life, and it turns out, her normal self. That night, Marshall, sit down, to write the letter he hoped Lily would never have to read. Kids, when you visited New York, there are count of something funny to see and do. And yes Colleen and Linsay took us to Tater-Skinz. After they broke-up, Robin went back to being Robin. And through 22 wonderful years of marriage, Marshall kept his promise. Until November 1 of last year when, sadly..."

613,3,2,robin ,"I was just so uptight in New York, you know? I mean, down here everybody shares everything. It's like we're all one big shimmering ball of positive energy. I wonder if anyone's ever thought that before. A drum circle! They're different every time. Let's go watch! And here I am at the drum circle. Oh, it was. I feel like the Robin who left is not the same Robin who came back, you know. Thank you. I'm evolved, and I'm enjoying living my life a little bit closer to the way Gael and I did in Argentina. My journey was transformative and I reassert my commitment to both the aforementioned paramour and the philosophies he espouses.[/b] Mmm. Yeah. It's great. Amazing, fantastic, awesome. Well, now that I'm home, I'm finding myself getting annoyed at things that I loved on vacation. Oh, so good. Ooh sofa! Ooh sofa! Sofa, sofa, oh... ooh (she grunts) Ooh. Laptop! Laptop! Laptop! (She sighs when the laptop fall over) And you know what else? I'm still finding sand everywhere. I mean, we haven't been to the beach since Argentina. Where is all coming from? But I don't want to. I was so happy down there. No, you know what? I'm done complaining. I'm evolving. Just gonna go with the flow. Wow. Gael, you're peeing while I'm in the shower. Okay. Okay, old Robin would have been like, dude, ocupado. But now, you know what, I'm cool with it. Pee it up. In fact, when you're done, why won't you come in here and join me? Gael, there's some weird du.. (A lot of people is on her apartment) Hello. Quick announcement. I am so glad that you're here, fellow travelers. A couple rules... not even rules. Let's call them guidelines for harmonious living. Guideline for harmonious living number one ; The kitchen sink is for dishes, the toilet is for pee-pee. G.F.H.L. number two ; Marijuana is illegal in the United States, even when baked into a blueberry muffin that someone might mistakenly eat for breakfast right before they leave for their job as a TV Newscaster. ""This just in: Look at my hand, how weird is my hand?"" is not an appropriate thing to say on the air. And number three... I... (All cherring). (Yelling) And number three is please keep the noise to a minimum. I have to take a nap. I'm still pretty baked. Can you please keep it down? Well. I have to have a job. I'm canadian. You know that. Wow. I just realized something. No, that you really suck. You're boring and lame and you're getting sand everywhere. Seriously, where is all the sand coming from? You're not the real me. All you are is me on vacation trying to get away from a break-up. What are you doing? All right, everyone out! I said everyone out!  I'm canadian! No, I'm not. Listen, Gael, I need to talk to you about something. Oh, good to be back. Although it's weird, vacation Robin popped into my dream again last night. This time we went all the way. Tell you one thing. She is maybe sandy but that chick knows what I like."
614,3,2,ted ,"So, beeing married, different? Not different? Thanks. Marshall brownies. Yes! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter. Seen 'em. I'm just happy Robin's happy. I'm just happy Robin's happy. I'm just jubilant my former paramour's jubilant. Yeah. That guy. Look at how easy he has it. He's better looking than us. Mmm. Yeah. Plus automatic out, you're leaving in a couple of days. God, I wish we were tourists. Okay, okay. We're from a small town in the south of France. Our plane leaves sunday morning. Oh. So, hey, you-you ladies, been awful nice to us. What do you say... ah, never mind. No... Well, it's just we're leaving sunday morning. It sure would be nice to have some real New Yorkers show us around. Really? It doesn't seem that lame to me. I think it's cool. I'm just saying it seems like a kind of bar a lot of cool people would hang out there. Yes, I'm sure this is the best of their 57 ""spudtacular"" east coast locations. Easiest? Somehow we have managed to find the two lamest new yorkers of all time. I'm looking at you. What? All right, Ignatius, one more hour. Hey. If we're going north, why did we cross over the FDR? We should have taken the Hudson. Where are we even going anyway? A hundred... on the south of Bronx at this time of night? We're going to get k*lled. There were three of them, at least two g*ns... they took all our money. ""Thank God, we're alive"" s*x. All right. I'm in. I've never worked this hard for anything in my life. Whew. What? West village? West Orange? New Jersey? You guys live in New Jersey, not New York? New Jersey? Oh, no. Oh, no. New Jersey is not ""pretty much New York"". You are not ""pretty much new yorkers"". Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to ""pretty much New York""? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey!"

Will you sign this thank you note? [South of Bronx - Ted/Barney/Colleen/Lindsay]Ted: Come on. Let's get out of here. This night's a disaster. Robin #2: What happened to you, man? You said you wouldn't change, but look at you. No more tan, no more beaded braids, no more lush, untamed forest of leg and armpit hair. You're back at work. What gives? Robin #2: ""I have to have a job"", God, that's so american. Robin #2: What about the important things like making your own jewerly and lying on the beach and thinking about peace? God, don't you care about thinking about peace? Robin #2: That you've lost your way. Robin #2: Don't you remember Argentina? Robin #2: Don't you want to go back? Robin #2: Shh. Let this happen."

Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections and I think... That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there but I guess we're both wrong, governor. No way, no way, no way! Put him on speaker. So what you're saying to us right now is you have a shot at the belt? That's right, it's resplendent. I never kid. Remember you said if I ever slept with that girl from Days of our Lives, I'd be the king? Well... All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83? Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds. Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women? Ted? Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me. (reading text) We're combing upsars. I cannot allow Ted to do this. Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom. I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close. So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location? I'll get the video camera. OK then. Oh my God. Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors shoot themselves in the foot. Oh no, the night's ruined! Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat? Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me. The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn. No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong. (laughs) Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1. That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one. OK, wait for it. Yes you can. So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it. What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it. You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you? You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me! Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you? Ted, belt. Did? Tell me. You know if he did it?"
617,3,3,blonde girl," Oh my God. My new carpet. Oh my God, this is a disaster, You get the carpet cleaner, I'll get a towel.  Get out!  So, Barney, why don't we take this party to a more horizontal location?"
618,3,3,brunette girl," OK.  No, baby, it's not."
619,3,3,future ted," Kids, I know you think that you've heard every story from back before I met your mother. But there are some stories you tell and some stories you don't."
620,3,3,lily ,"Oh, this store in the Village had one of those crazy sales. It was a footwear feeding frenzy. I saw it first. You just made the list, bitch. You look fantastic in them, Robin. But don't you think they're a little high for that dress? New girl? What new girl? Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. Give it to me. Are they friends? (Ted on phone) Are they Betas? Because they're all sluts and you can tell them right now I didn't wanna be in their sorority anyway. OK, well, don't worry, I'll come down and help you figure it out. It's me, I'm at the bar. Don't look, just call me mom. What? What's the matter with you? Anyway, both of these girls are into you. Take your pick. Yes, of course. They're playing with their hair and touching your arm. Class green light. Positive. They both want you bad. It's a clearance sale and you're the boots, baby. Oh, it's Robin. Good luck. Hello. What about the no-shave rule? What happened to your convictions? No, I'm not doing it. The whole point to not shaving... I'm on my way. Well, he's right, it's a dead heat. Neither one is giving ground. I could not tell who was the third wheel. Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts. If I died, I'd just come back and haunt your pen1s. Fine, sleep with your nurses. Tonight you ride the unicycle. Hello. Sorry, I can't leave now. He's coming upstairs! We know, we know, Ted. Well done, this is very impressive. Up top. Oh, don't be gross. Oh, you can use our bedroom. I knew it. I had a hunch about that girl and I was right. I saw it first. You just made the list, bitch. I cannot give up my bedroom to a boot thief. She should be punished, not rewarded. No, never. Thanks, enjoy our bedroom. I'll get your coats? Ted: I don't know why I said that. Why did I say that? It's the opposite of what I meant. I wanna take clothes off them, not put more on. What are you talking about? Barney: If you must know, it wasn't a freak beverage malfunction that stopped me from riding the tricycle that night. I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I'm actually moved. Bring it in, guys."
621,3,3,marshall ,"Yes, advantage Ericksen. Fortnight. British words are so cool. Plus, did you know lawyers there get to wear wigs? I wear a wig to work, I'm a jackass. Can't go. Tournament. Yeah, which takes an hour and a half of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve. Shekwakie. This is Wimbledon, Ted. I need the freedom and mobility that only underwear can provide. Cheerio. Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean. I thought we were in for the evening. What's happening? No way, no way, no way. It's a tricycle. Wait wait wait, what belt? Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt, right? Why wasn't I told about the belt? I could go for the belt. If Lily were to die before me, then I could ride the tricycle. Scenario number 12. We're in a horrific car crash, you die, I'm left paralyzed. Two sexy nurses with a six-pack of wine coolers sneak into my room late at night. I try to blink at them in morse code, ""Please, don't, I love my dead wife,"" but they're medical professionals and I gotta think somehow they're saving my life. I already did this morning. We're combing upsars? What does that mean? Where are my pants? Where's my pants! Yeah bro, up top. No, no way. The other day I saw a pigeon take a crap on it and the whole thing shifted. But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting. Tom Petty. Ted, you're ruining this for everyone. Why would you do that to yourself?"
622,3,3,rachel ,"Trudy, no way! Hi. No, we're sorority sisters. When we weren't at each other's throats.  Hey, mista... OK, are you going to Stacy's wedding? No! Again? That's like her third one. So, Trudy and I got a table. But I want you to stay. See, he agrees with me. You're such a little man-thief. Really? I think Ted is hilarious. He left, junior year abroad. We were gonna do, but never did. No, It's too embarrassing. You tell him. I don't care if you don't care. Why don't we tell him together? Well, it is getting pretty late. I'm sorry, where was your apartment again? Ooh, nice place! Hey, are these your roommates? You know what else is essential when you're listening to music? Music. OK, we'll try and stay out of trouble. That's OK, we don't need music to have fun. I am so exhausted. You give the most amazing foot massage. Oh my God."
623,3,3,robin ,"Thanks for lending me these boots. Where did you get them from? Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've begun a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave. That is so fascinating. So what happened? Wow, gosh, separating conjoined twins. That must be the most amazing feeling. That is so funny. You are so funny. Bring me a razor. They've been surgically removed by Dr. Awesome. Lily, please, he's really cute and I really like him. And he's got a British accent. Lily, I have pounded three cappuccinos waiting for you. Pretty soon I won't have to shave, the hair is going to vibrate off my legs. Lily, he can't see my legs like this. I look like a Turkish lesbian There is a pharmacy across the street. Would 20 bucks buy me a razor? Where's the shaving cream? Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream? Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude? Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies room. I've got TB...tiny bladder. I'll meet you out front? You've gotta be kidding me. Excuse me. I'm here, I'm fine, my head is bleeding. Going down again."
624,3,3,robin's date," Well, after eighteen hours of surgery, I closed and thankfully both girls just celebrated their second birthday.  True, but now the parents don't know what to do with their huge supply of four-legged overalls.  Hey Robin, the valet's brought the car around. I thought we'd go back to my place. You in the mood for a night cap?  Yeah.  Oh hey. Will you go in there and see if my date's OK?  OK.  Guilty as charged."
625,3,3,robins' date," I guess I shouldn't be so surprised. I mean, she was acting weird all night, right? Waitress: Yeah. You know..."
626,3,3,ted ,"Oh my God. Barney...oh my God. OK. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt. The belt. All right, I'm ready, let's hit it. What? We agreed, I suited up. What are you talking about? I got the low-maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look. Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not? Really? All right, going down to the bar and ordering three beers, I'll see you in five minutes.  3 beers, 5 minutes. All right, the beers are here. Oh come on, we agreed...Did Marshall take his pants off? Fine, I don't need friends. I got you guys. You guys are my friends, my cold refreshing friends. I'm talking to beer. Trudy. Oh my God, I haven't seen you since... That was you? Kidding. I was super wasted... that night. These are not all for me. No, I was gonna call you but I was so embarrassed. Those were yours? I thought they felt kinda tight. Kidding, I don't wear underwear, ladies underwear. Often. Again, I'm kidding. I know, do you wanna get a... Let me guess, you guys met in prison. Well, beers, what do you want to do? Stay here, or I know this other place called my belly. Oh, that's cool, I was gonna get outta here anyway, I'm really tired. Tired of people who fold early 'cause I am wide awake. OK, guys, be cool. I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident. So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive. And I don't know which one to go for. Yeah. No, I don't know. They're old sorority sisters. They're Kappas and I think I can score with one of them. I don't know which one and if I choose wrong, I lose 'em both. Well, that's very complicated. Oh, somebody should lock you girls up.  I am never not wearing a suit again. Hello. Hi Mom, how's dad's colon? They are? Are you sure? Are you positive? Bye mom. My mom. So, this college boyfriend, who, who won him? What? What, what were you guys gonna do but never did. Nobody cares, just say it. It's a tricycle. It's a tricycle. Barney and I have this running joke that the first guy to actually pull this off would win the championship belt. You actually bought a belt. It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around. Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do? Yes. Yes. What? No. No. Look, I gotta go. They're gonna think I inherited my dad's imaginary bathroom issues. Oh, are you guys leaving? Right, well... Great, I have it right upstairs. It's in my apartment upstairs. Let's so upstairs. That's funny. I love that. You should tell more jokes at my apartment upstairs. Got 'em. Yes, yes, but they are not here. They are somewhere else. We have total privacy because privacy is essential when you're listening to music. That's hilarious. You are hilarious. I'll go get it in my bedroom. The CD's in my bedroom. Bedroom. This is gonna be awesome. No! What are you guys doing here? I've got, I've got... You guys need to get out of here right now. Please, take the fire escape. OK, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD...Barney. What are you doing? Why, why? Let me get this straight. You're gonna trike block me? That is so petty. It's like you're... Tom Petty. You're Tom Petty. Where's Lily? Still looking for that CD, so... What are you doing? Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me. What if I reimburse you for the boots, full retail? OK, take it. Wish me luck. So, I'm having a little trouble finding the CD. Exactly. It's getting late, I'll get your coats. See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have? It won't? Ladies, couldn't find your coats but I did find tequila. Wait, wait wait, a remote control fire place? We don't have a remote control fire place. Why would I want to tire them out? It's 'cause I used to practice all the time on my grandmother. Why in God's name would I say that? I was just thinking about this documentary I saw once about something called a supervolcano. OK, what the hell. Could happen at any time and obliterate all life on earth, which is why I live by three simple words. Don't postpone joy. Yeah. Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this. All right. I'll see you on the other side. Some stories you tell, some stories you don't."
627,3,3,trucy ,That's so true.
628,3,3,trudy ,"Ted. Trudy. I slept with you, then climbed down the fire escape? You were embarrassed? I was like, I really like this guy and now I'm climbing out his window. And I forgot my underwear. I am so glad I ran into you. Oh my God, Rachel, how are you? Ted, this is Rachel. And best friends forever, all sophomore year. We could be so competitive. But that's all behind us now. We have so much catching up do to. Oh, it's off, apparently he's into dudes. I know. Oh, Ted, OK, settle an argument. Is it stealing if you go out with someone's boyfriend after they've broken up? You're the man-thief, man-thief. You're so funny. I think Ted is funny. Neither of us. It's really too bad. There was that one thing we wanted to do. No, you tell him. I don't care. OK, on three. One. Two. Three I thought maybe we could all go and listen to that Wilco CD you talked about before. Of course we can't promise anything. You do like to have fun, don't you Ted? So exhausted. Ted, what's wrong?"
629,3,3,waitress ,"No, but fifty will. Well, you didn't ask me for shaving cream. Well, who doesn't shave their legs for her date? Well, here's a little tip for you. Shave your legs before you leave the house, Sasquatch. No problem. No, nobody's in there, but the window's actually open. Why don't I buy you a drink? Did I overhear that you're a surgeon? You're so funny."
630,3,3,,"Barney, Marshall: Yes. Rachel, Trudy: Kappa Epsilon Gamma! Whoo! Rachel, Trudy: (Trudy joins in singing and dancing)... hey mista, stay away from my sista.  Barney: Behold. Trudy, Rachel: Oh!  Barney: Right, that's my apartment. Dressing gown's mine too. Damn, this should be me. (back to present scene in Ted's room) Barney: It's endearing, you're a caregiver. Never take family values out of the equation.  Barney: Did you? Did you? Or didn't you?"
631,3,4,barney ,"She's totally hot and really fun.  But she has a dead tooth. If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it! Shotgun. Nice.  But she's Canadian. I can't think of anything. OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch. The ultimate ice breaker. A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year. Suddenly we see these snake bastards sneaking towards a little baby. Not on our watch. You grab the kid, I strangle six cobras with my bare hands. Women of New York, one at a time please. We got bit. They're different eyes. I don't see why this bugs you. Patch up! Oh, Theodore... Oh yeah? I'm the New York state gaming commissioner. Wow. OK, Marshall. Which one of us has more game? What? Marshall: If dating is the game, then marriage is winning the game. OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert. Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list. Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad. There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges... That's good too. How about her? Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules? I win. Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot. I can't sleep with her again. She hates me. By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy. Whatever, Ted. Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song. Nice. Doesn't count. OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know. We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted: You know what, I don't mind. Barney: No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak. No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going (lowers head slightly and shakes it vigorously) on what I've already gone (lowers head again slightly and shakes it vigorously) on. Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic. And I only stirred that with my pinky. That's what you think happened. Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend? So now, whatever nice things Ted does for her, in her mind, I'm the guy who's even nicer than him. Not even at all. It gets better. Remember Ted's phone conversation? Well? Oh. Stacy, right? Yeah, wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here too? I'm gonna head out to a reggae concert. I'm a huge fan of reggae. No way, I wonder why Ted didn't tell me about that. Like I said, I'm a huge reggae fan. We are two peas. Wow, take care. Namaste. So now with Ted out of the picture, I'm gonna swoop in and take the whole thing. Translation: 'cause I got game, bitches. Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy. Hey, stace. What happened? He did not. Stay there, I'll be right over. That's what makes you so special, baby."
632,3,4,brooke ,"Hi, I'm Brooke, I'm here for my date with George. You must be the babysitter. I had so much coffee earlier, I need to run to the loo. Hey Dougie."
633,3,4,doug ,"Who are you? Robin: I'm Robin. That's a bird's name. My friend, Patrick, has a parakeet named Robin, so there. You wanna talk in Morse code? Beep, beep beep beep, beep beep, beeeep. I'm starving. Can you make me cereal? What are you doing? You're supposed to pour milk first? Robin: What? No, you pour the cereal first so you know how much milk you need. It tastes better milk first. Why are you wearing my dad's pants? What are you reading? Robin: The business section. The Fed's gonna lower rates again to bail out these subprime lenders, bunch of idiots. Miss Aldrin says it's not nice to call people names. That's what I said. You're pretty cool. Are you here to see my dad? He's taking a shower. I wrote a poem, you wanna hear it.? To my new mommy. You're pretty, you're nice, And you smell like daisies. Why would I draw a picture of you? Two. We just really connected. Why are you getting so upset, Roberta? Whatever. Look, you're great, but..."
634,3,4,future ted vo," It was Saturday night in New York City and the young metropolitan set was out on the town, living the kind of crazy lifestyle you can only find in the Big Apple.  So, Robin went on a date with George, the guy with the kid. And afterwards...  And, kids, that's exactly what she did.  Then on a totally different day that was definitely not the next morning, Aunt Robin had to face her worst fear.  Meanwhile, Stacy and I had started dating. Oh, Stacy was the girl from the bar. Anyway, I was close to winning the bet when something unexpected happened, I started to really like her.  Aunt Robin didn't know what to say. This kid had never been dumped before.  Of course, Robin eventually made her peace with kids. And as you guys know she went on to appear in some very important works of arts. Yours."
635,3,4,george ,"You're a big kids person, huh? Babies. Well, Doug's almost six Excuse me, what? Robin: I mean, I don't hate kids. I'm just not a kid person. I mean, yeah, it's cute that their shoes are real little, but beyond that, what's the draw? You must think I'm nuts. What? No no no. So you don't like kids, so what? I'm not looking for a mother for Doug. Why don't we just hold off on you meeting him?"
636,3,4,lily ,"100! We only got to 82 on our honeymoon. So, Robin, I've got a guy for you. He's cute, he's funny, he's smart. What do you mean? Ted: When someone wants to set you up they always tell you the good qualities first but then they leave out their huge flaw. She's so cute and she's so smart.  But her last boyfriend had to get a restraining order against her and then his cat and new vacuum cleaner both went missing. Well, there's nothing wrong with this guy. He's really nice and he's really cute. But the guy is really great. And his kid's sweet, he's in my class. OK, that's awesome.  But she's a g*n nut. But? Well, you knew you'd meet him sooner or later. Robin, What's the big deal? He's just a kid. He's not gonna bite. He may bite. We're working on biting. A good one. He won full custody. Hey, what's up? Just talk to him. You can do this, Robin. Really, that's great. You and George, all thanks to me. What? I hate to tell you this but, too late. He drew it in class today. You are so in denial right now. And you're doing what you always do in relationships. Honey, it's you. And if you're gonna break up with George, you have to break up with his kid too. Yeah, you can't just abandon him. You have to talk to him. Come on, Robin, you know it's the right thing to do. I can't believe you got dumped by a 6-year-old."
637,3,4,little barney," Hey, Ted, pucker up all you want but I was here first.  From this spot, I also launched an expedition to those two large ridges down there."
638,3,4,little girl," Robin, will you watch cartoons with me?"
639,3,4,little robin, I go to school all week. Can't I just have five minutes to myself to read Highlights and drink my juice?
640,3,4,marshall ,"She's superhot and she's so successful.  But she has a pug that she pushes around in a stroller. Oh. You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays.  But she didn't like Field of Dreams. Wow. You're here and not in stall two. I may have made some wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes. Yes. Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me. You're joking. I have mad game, bra. What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out. Do you guys wanna hear one of my lines? Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl. One time I was with this girl and I tried that model line, and I totally got some over-the-shirt boob action at a Just Say No assembly. Ted, she's leaving. Look who's got game. I am not irrelevant. I ran the numbers. If Lily and I have s*x twice a week, which, let's be honest, we all know is being conservative. And we've been together for ten years plus seventeen more times on the honeymoon. Minus the two week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store reminded me of a young Lily. Then we have had s*x a total of...wait for it... One thousand fifty-three and a half times...my mom called once. But that's more times than Barney has ever had s*x and to your point, Ted, Lily is a quality girl. I win. Lawyered. Totally counts. That's totally you. You're joking, right? Hey, now that you're a mom, are you gonna start wearing those totally awesome jeans that go right up to your boobs? Which Chumbawumba song? Barney: Well, what an interesting turn of events. It looks like I'm going to win. Wow, that's good."
641,3,4,robin ,"Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice. I don't hate kids. OK, yes, kids are not my favorite thing in the world but I like them. I like sports cars but it doesn't mean I wanna push a Ferrari through my v*g1n* You know what, the kid is not a problem. I wanna meet this guy. Yeah. Hey, what's my 'but'? You know, I'm really nice, but... OK, here's the thing, George is a great guy, we had a wonderful date. Can't wait to meet him? Why did I say that? I don't wanna meet his kid. I was just hoping for later, like in 20 years when I'm a cougar and he's as hot as his dad. Why is this kid around anyway? Shouldn't he be with his mom? What kind of lawyer does this guy have if he has to take care of the kid all the time? He won? He won. Oh God, getting the kid is winning, isn't it? Don't tell anyone I said that. Only the biggest ever. I think kids are so great. Especially the little ones. You know, uh, pudgy, can't sit up, don't have teeth yet. Yeah, I like that kind. Oh, six is great. You are gonna love six. Six is when they really start to... (Robin nods) I hate kids. Yeah, let's take things slow. It's here, Lily. It's looking at me. The kid, what do I do? No it's not. It's actually a type of bird. Dude, I'm just reading my paper. Sure. It all tastes the same once it's in the bowl. Milk first it is. Well, maybe if they weren't such idiots, I wouldn't have to call them that. You too. Guess who loves Robin? Kids, kids love Robin. Doug thinks I'm pretty cool. Yeah, I'm gonna have to break up with him. Well, tt's just getting a little bit too serious with the kid. You know, it's just not what I'm looking for. So, better that I break it off now before he gets too attached. What? Oh crap. There's no way that's a picture of me. That woman has on hoop earrings, I don't even own hoop earrings. I have one pair and they're gold. Those are Fruit Loops. We'll ask the guys. They'll tell you that's not me You guys are totally crazy. It's not me. It's not me. Do guys really think this is me? Really? Man. Doug was right, you are a pain in the ass. Hey, Doug. Actually, I came to see you. Sure, why not? Oh, that is so sweet, Even though it doesn't rhyme. Look, uh, Doug. There's no good way to say this. We need to talk. I just think, um, we both could use some space right now. It's not you, it's me. I know this hurts but you deserve someone better. I'm just really trying to focus on my career right now, you know. I just hope we can still be friends. What the hell was that? Doug: That was my new mommy. So, this picture is not of me? How many dates has she been on with your dad? Well, I've been on like five and you like her better? And what about me? You think I go around pouring cereal for every boy in town. Robin. My name is Robin. Like the bird, remember? So, that's it, huh? Yeah, there's always a 'but'. Whatever. He's a stupid head. I'm just, I'm done with kids."
642,3,4,stacy ,"So, I, I had a really nice time tonight. Yeah? Uh, Ted, something wrong? You are so sweet. I'm sorry. Yeah. Oh, you're Ted's friend from the bar? I do. Oh my gosh, I play in a reggae band. Hey. You know, I really appreciate how cool you've been about us taking things slow. Anyway, I am so psyched to be playing Sun Splash tomorrow. We go on sometime between 11 and 6 so you probably wanna get there before nine to be safe. Oh, and it's gonna be muddy."
643,3,4,ted ,"What's his 'but'? Wow, set it up. I'm still convinced she k*lled my turtle. But? Lily: Fine, but he has a kid. Aha! There it is. Robin's not going out with a guy with a kid. Doesn't matter. Robin hates kids. You told me even when you were a kid, you hated kids. Well, you don't wanna have them.  But she's afraid of commitment. You don't have a 'but'. Why? So, what are the eye patches for? On the eye? Barney: Yes. Both of us. OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches. Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen. Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. Yeah, so? Yeah, if you're playing in the women's league. I hate to say it, buddy, but you're kinda' irrelevant. First of all, I did not ask to see that list and I am still horrified. True game is about quality, not quantity. And a quality girl would pick me over you any day. Fine. Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins. You're on. OK, great. Rule number one, no eye patches or props of any kind. Just stop. You're bumming everybody out. Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars. How? Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook. Oh, Interesting. Look who just took a commanding lead. Now, with you out of the picture, I can take my sweet time. Get out of my way. Well, have fun in yoga. She's strengthening her core. That's gonna be good. Yeah, all right. After a while, crocodile. You see this. Game face. Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that? You're right, it counts. It counts as one. You've had s*x once. How was it? Marshall: I still matter. Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing. Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK? Fine. Hey, who drew the picture of Robin? ""My new mommy."" Kinda has a nice ring to it. Me too. Mm-hm. Well, I couldn't do it. I broke up with her. Thanks a lot by the way. A beautiful, sexy girl and all I could think about was you being there first. You were stuck in my head like a Chumbawumba song. What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped. OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any... So you never slept with her? Well., have fun in yoga After a while crocodile. You are a sociopath. That was my yoga mat. No, no, this doesn't prove anything because... I should have just worn that stupid eye patch."
644,3,4,,"Robin, Ted: 97, 98, 99, 100!  Robin: Great, I can't wait to meet him.  Barney: I'm going out, buying eye patches. What are you doing to help score chicks? Barney:...no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game.  Ted: She plays bass in a reggae band. Stacy, Barney: See you later alligator."
645,3,5,alexa ,"So, Ted, remember the last time we were here? Ted, come on. Freshman year, we were both pretty drunk? Actually."
646,3,5,audrey ,"You know, I actually know some sign language.  Hi, my name is Audrey. Nice to meet you Here. Call me."
647,3,5,barney ,"So, she's hot. Then she's crazy. Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes. There's no way she's above the line on the hot-crazy scale. Let me illustrate. A girl is allowed to be crazy... Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot. If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot. You want the girl to be above this line Also known as the Vicky Mendoza diagonal. This girl I dated, she played jump rope with that line. She'd shave her head... She'd stab me with a fork... I should give her a call. I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts... OK, we'll see. It's crazy how cute that is. It's crazy. Really? Sixteen no's. Really? Oh, here we go. Your own line of handbags? That's crazy. OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it. Tonight's the first time I'm taking my deaf brother out since our mom died. No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh. Wow, you bought that? Are you a total idiot, Ted? I like you Ted. Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live. Barney. We met at the urinal. Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit. Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A. Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes. Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward.  Edward, this is Audrey. He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like. What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time. And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever. Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online. Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right? Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale. She started the night here But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone. Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to k*ll me with a brick. How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin: Yeah, like five or six times. It was right over there. Here's your problem, you've only slept with one woman. Those kind of stats are only okay if you're eleven. But tonight, we're getting you a new girl because Marshall Eriksen, from this moment on, I make all your decisions for you. I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed. No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference. Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her. How much hotter is she than your girlfriend? Marshall: There's no comparison. What do you think, Ted? Go for it? Ted: Oh, don't do it, man. Think about Lily. Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger. Poor guy's gonna crash and burn. That man is a god. I thought it was a Mr. Miyagi kind of thing. Worst superheroes ever. World of Warcraft? The online role playing game? That's how you two met online?"
648,3,5,blah-blah," Please call me Blah.  Well, I was taking this cooking class, French fusion, and everyone already had a partner but then I looked up, and across a crowded room, I saw Ted. It was magical.  Long story short, thank goodness I'm such a bad cook or I never would have met Ted.  Yeah. Marshall: All right, but spoiler alert, it ends with everyone saying 'aw.'  Ohhh.  You guys are so lucky. You know, when Ted and I were cooking and our hands touched for the first time, I knew right then that after class he would take me up on the roof, kiss me and give me a rose, which he did.  Saw 'aw.'  I know, right? I'll get the next round, OK guys.  So, you're single.  Hm. Oh, so, pretty and single and friends with Ted. Great.  Oh, I get it. Ted told you I didn't go to college so now you're giving me a cute little backhanded slap.  Well, while you were busy majoring in being freaking beautiful, I was starting my own line of handbags.  These have sold in Japan. Robin, have you ever sold anything in Japan?  I don't have a distributor here yet, but thanks for rubbing that in. Why are you trying to undermine me in front of Ted?  Wow, that just came out of nowhere.  I wasn't worried. Are you saying I should be?  Oh good, 'cause I'm not. Now, Robin, could you just let it go? You're making all of us really uncomfortable.  Oh my God, you told them.  Wait, you guys dated. For how long?  Oh, I see what's going on here, Ted, I'm just some random girl to make Robin jealous and after she takes you back, you probably won't even remember my name.  Then why has she been trying to undermine me all night? I mean, look at her. She's laughing at me right now.  I'm sorry, it's just Lily and Marshall's story is so romantic. I just wish we had something like that.  What do you mean?  Well, how about I tell you a little secret about what you might get to do later tonight.  Oh my God.  You have to tell Marshall.  If you don't tell him, I will.  So, Lily, how did you and Ted meet? Come on, Lily, the real story.  That's not the story, Ted, tell 'em.  I know that you and Ted made out the night before you met Marshall.  Lily and Ted made out. What do you think of that, Robin? Marshall: What are you talking about? Lily: You know that guy I made out with at the freshman orientation party?  (to Ted) You don't really believe that, do you? You swore it was Lily.  Another girl, Ted? Who haven't you made out with? You know what, I don't need this. I design handbags. I'm writing a memoir. I'm a superstar. This is totally my year. Someday the name Blah-blah will be up in lights. Ted, next time you're online playing World of Warcraft, don't even think about chatting with me."
649,3,5,college guy," Dude, I heard the dean is coming. Put out your sandwich."
650,3,5,college lily," Hi.  Yeah, I'm a first-year. I'm in Hewitt 220.  Maybe I will, Hewitt 110.  Oh, it's fruity.  So, uh, do you have a girlfriend?  Wow."
651,3,5,college marshall," Hi.  Good afternoon, sir. I'm Marshall Eriksen. College Ted: Sir? Please, just call me Ted.  OK, Dean Ted.  What? No. Really? I don't know 'cause I don't even know what sandwiches smell like. My parents are gonna donate a lot of money to this school.  What do you mean?  Ted, this is Lily."
652,3,5,college students, Chug chug chug chug
653,3,5,college ted," Hey.  Whoa. Someone's been eating a sandwich.  So you're bottom bunk, that's cool. I wanted the top bunk anyway.  I'm your new roommate. College Marshall: This is so unfair.  Hey, you a freshwoman? I never use the word freshman. Sexist.  No way, Hewitt 110. You should totally come by.  These drunk idiots. Hey, don't drink their two dollar beer. This is a pinot noir from Europe.  Yeah, I cut it with some cranberry juice, it's pretty strong.  Yeah. Not sure about the whole long distance thing though. It's like Descartes says, ""In order to determine whether we can know anything with certainty, we first have to doubt everything we know."" You know?  I made a huge mistake last night, but it's like Descartes says.  In order to determine whether there's anything we can know with certain, we first have to doubt everything we know. And I now know for certain that I love you, Karen. Anyway, call me back when you get this. I'm also going down to the computer center to send you an electronic mail.  No, no, I'm sorry but I love Karen."
654,3,5,everyone ,Aw.
655,3,5,female avatar," Yes, we should.  Ted. What's yours?"
656,3,5,future ted vo," Kids, back in the fall of 2007, I was dating this girl named...oh God, what was her name? It's been 23 years, I can't remember all this stuff. For the sake of the story, let's call her...  Except it wasn't.  When you've been a couple as long as Marshall and Lily, telling the how we met story becomes a choreographed dance.  Now, they perfected that story over hundreds of tellings. The first time Marshall told it to me, it was a little different.  Kids, to understand this story, you need to know that your Uncle Marshall was doing something that lots of college kids do. How do I say this? He was, uh, let's say eating a sandwich.  So, suffice it to say, Blah-blah did not turn out to be your mother. As for the girl I made out with at the party... ...there wasn't a doubt in my mind, that was your Aunt Lily.  But you know that magical story of how she and Uncle Marshall met, it was worth preserving, so I kept my mouth shut.  Until our 20th college reunion when I ran into Alexa Leskies."
657,3,5,lily ,"Aw. It was late August 1996 Don't be embarrassed, Ted, it was a long time ago. Ted, what's going on? Yeah, I know, I just told her. Ted, what are you talking about? Come on what? Ted, I honestly don't know what you're talking about. What? Ted and I never made out. I only made out with one other guy in college before I met Marshall, and it was just some random dude. I don't even remember his name. I just call him too-much-tongue guy. That wasn't me. No, no no no no no no no no no no no. Marshall, I need to talk to you. Can we go somewhere in private? And I'm unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl. Baby, I am so sorry. Are you sure? Marshall: If it wasn't, I peed in the wrong guy's shampoo, man. I know. Sandwiches are strong these days. Dude, we're 42."
658,3,5,lily vo," For some unknown reason, I felt drawn to room 110.  And as fate would have it, that someone was Marshall."
659,3,5,marshall ,"So, Blah, how did you two meet? Ay, Chihuahua. Starts with it too. Lily and I were both freshmen moving into I know, right? Dude, this black-haired Goth chick stopped by today, (singing) wanna tap that. I didn't realize Ted wasn't the dean until later that night. You're not the dean. Tell us what? I'm sorry, who are you again? I'm not gonna cheat on my girlfriend. You know what, I don't care. I've been with one woman for too long. I need me some strange. For like a week after, Barney followed me around, asking me to teach him how to live. I even got him to do my laundry once. Yeah, of course, what's wrong? Too-much-tongue guy? Yeah. Unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl? Yeah. I don't think you need to be. I was at that party. It was dark, and granted, I had eaten quite a few sandwiches but I'm a hundred percent sure that unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl was Alexa Leskies, it's not Lily. Look what I've confiscated from some kids. I know, right? Chew chew chew chew, swallow. It's all right, honey. Baby, can we grow sandwiches behind the garage?"
660,3,5,marshall vo, And she needed some help setting up her stereo.  As if she knew that someone very special was behind that door.
661,3,5,robin ,"Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore. Wait, hot-crazy scale? No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Barney and I are not together. No. No. Yeah. College, good times. Uh, no, but I would love to buy one of them if... Where can I get one? Look, there's nothing going on between me and Ted. No, I'm just saying you don't have anything to worry about. No, I'm saying that you shouldn't be. A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about s*x, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?"
662,3,5,ted ,"Everyone, this is Blah-blah. It was so magical. She's gonna tell some bogus story about a cooking class because she's embarrassed we met online. What? There's no stigma anymore. Oh, she's gorgeous. No she's not. OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me. She's not even on the hot-crazy scale. She's just hot. OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class. She's not crazy. You know who else has a really cute story of how they met? Marshall and Lily. You guys should tell that story right now. Anybody'd be stressed out meeting new people. She's not crazy. Crazy generous maybe, buying us drinks. You know who else is friends with Ted? Marshall. How did we meet? It's a good story, I'm gonna tell it right now. Uh, it was the first day of college. You know what else is a good story, how Barney and I met. Barney, tell that story, right now. Please. Oh, I'm sorry about that. Oh man, I'm really sorry. What? Barney: I just made that up mid-pee. It worked on you, it's definitely gonna work on that blonde chick at the end of the bar. Unless you're a total idiot. What's your name? Ted. Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Barney: (laughs) Well played. Oh right, hi. I'm not wearing a suit.  I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.  My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number. Barney, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.  He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number. OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies. Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Robin. Their story is not as magical as it seems. No, I can't, it's kind of a secret. The night before Lily met Marshall, there was this party. As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me. Yeah, and in all these years Lily and I have never spoken about it, so again, mum's the word, OK? If he heard that, it would destroy him. Oh, come on, you wouldn't. Oh no. I don't think anyone wants to hear that story. Yes, that is the unabridged story of how Lily and I met. How embarrassing. Who wants another round? Lily, will you help us get the next round? She knows about us, about how we really met. No, the real story. Lily, come on. Lily, come on. Lily, come on. Yeah, we did. What? Too-much-tongue guy? I'm not surprised to hear that coming from unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl. Yes it was, at the freshman orientation party. This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass. You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da. So we should make lots of Star Wars references around girls, that's what you're saying? And you know that girl I made out with at the freshman orientation party? I'm too-much-tongue guy. Really? Marshall: Yeah, I'm positive. And too-much-tongue guy was Colin O'Riley. I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa. Yeah, it's really, it's a cool game. I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa. You and me? No idea. That was you? So I am not too-much-tongue guy. No. That is a fat sandwich. I can't believe I used to be able to eat a whole sandwich by myself. Now it's like two bites and I am done. Where's my wife?"
663,3,5,warrior avatar, We should grab some coffee sometime...  What's your name?
664,3,5,,"Barney:... as long as she is equally hot. Barney:...then lose ten pounds. Barney:... then get a boob job. Lily, Marshall: Hewitt Hall. Marshall, Lily VO: It was love at first sight.  Ted: Shut up.  Blah-blah: So, we know how Marshall and Lily met. Robin, how did you and Barney meet?  Ted: Lily, we never made out."
665,3,6,all ,Oh yeah. A little bit. Yeah.
666,3,6,barney ,"This is incredible! I have big news! Okay. My thing's pretty huge. But fine, you can go first. I just find a porno starring Ted Mosby! I'm talking about welcome to the s*x plane, and look who plays the navigator, Ted Mosby (He shows a porno dvd) All right. Let's meet your new doppelganger. Or should I say doppel banger. Probably not the same guy. Oh, hey, hey-o. New guy entering the cockpit. Could it be the navigator, Ted Mosby. Yeah, and I'm sure complete accuracy in all those details was very important to the directors... ""Dirt and skank, the raunch brothers"". And I found a porno starring Ted Mosby. I know, right? Congratulation for us all. The fact that I found a porno starring a guy named Ted Mosby... Let's do it! Ted, Ted, Ted, guy in the hat! Three stripes, ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ted Mosby, p*rn star. See, this is way better than Marshall's intership. More around the eyes. Hmm. You're not wrong. (He looks on his phone) According to the web site, of the far superior Ted Mosby... he's been in the business three months, and he's made 125 movies. Oh, he is good. Classic seduction technique. Oh, I use it all the time. First I buy her... and by her I mean you... a drink. Now, I'm the guy who gets her what she wants. Then I pretend to care about whatever idiotic thing she cares about. For you, that would be the enviroment. Now, I'm the great guy who shares her interests. And before you know it, you're naked in my apartment, shouting ""oh-oh Bar-r-r-ne-e-y""! And by you, I mean her. That comes later. At dinner. He did invite you to dinner, didn't he? Don't wait up. Affirmative. Or to put in another way... God bless America."
667,3,6,jeff ,"I'm sorry. Stop. I can't do this with a straight face. You don't want to work here. You're only here 'cause your dad went to high school with Joe Hewitt. Fact is, you just got a sweet job at the NRDC. And it's awesome. Man, I could have gone the non-profit route. I didn't. And it eats me up inside every day. I hate myself. I hate myself. Let me buy you a dinner. Tomorrow night. As a thank you, okay? You'll tell me all about the NRDC, and we'll charge it all to one of my evil clients. Marshall, you know what kobe beef is? The place I'm taking you has kobe lobster. That is lobster fed with kobe beef. Right, listen, I know we're only here to screw over my client, who quite frankly deserves it... hum, but I gotta be able to tell the guys upstairs I gave you the spiel, okay? So, first up, starting salary. (He gives him a paper). He's a client. Who do you think bought us this wine? (To Patrick) Crazy, Swayze. Cheers, buddy. Listen, I know, I know. You are not gonna be tempted by big numbers and fancy perks. You're gonna do the noble thing, take the low-paying job at the NRDC, live off you family money. You do have family money, don't you? NRDC. No family money. Hum. So you don't plane on having kids? Well. New York public school make a lot of parents nervous, but the kids who walk out, walk out proud."
668,3,6,jefferson ,"Marshall, Jefferson Coastworth. Dude, I am so, so psyched that you're here. Can I beer ya? Go to hell! I'd do it again! (To the media) I'm innocent. I'm innoncent. Marshall, why don't you want to work at Nicholson, Hewitt and West?"
669,3,6,leonard ,"Hi, I'm looking for Ted Mosby. It's Leonard Ross from AVW. Well, that's a bummer. Anyway, I'm calling to interview you about your latest project. Oh! Group scene. Always fun. Guys? Oh, wouah, there's a scoop."
670,3,6,lily ,"I hope it's not that you just won some sort of race here. Wow. Oh my God, that's amazing! Oh, let's go celebrate. But you're still gonna go to your job interview today, right, baby? Marshall, your dad went through a lot of trouble to set this up. You can't just pull out at the last second. ""This project was so demanding, I can't tell you how many nights I spent bent over a table."" Oh, hey, baby, how'd the interview go? Oh, you should go. I mean, you're not gonna take the job, but you might as well get a great meal out of the deal. Hmm. Wait, are you telling me that they actually have conventions for p*rn? Yeah. Yeah. I shop the sales. There were in the closet when we moved in. I steal. I'm a criminal. I once shot a man just to watch him die. Oh, okay."
671,3,6,marshall ," Oh my God! I can't believe it!  Oh my God! Okay, I just found out... Okay, you know, cute coincidence, Barney. Whatever. I just got on the phone with the NR... Guys, guys, guys! Can I tell my news? It's pretty... I got the job at the NRDC. Thanks. It's kind of weird hugging with p*rn on. Baby, I have some exciting news. I got the job at the NRDC. I'm not doing that interview. Those people are evil. It's a real job. Hmm. It's hard to tell. Go, go like this. Um, interesting. There I am in the office of Jefferson Coatsworth and I figure I'm not gonna take this job anyway, I might as well give this old b*st*rd a piece of mind. Jefferson Coastworth wasn't what I expected. Hello. Right, um, okay, Jeff, I've actually given this a lot of thought... What do you mean? He is not trying to seduce me. He didn't even offer me the job. I, you know, I don't know if... The most expensive beef in the world. Oh my God. He's trying to seduce me. No. No way. I promise myself to the NRDC. I'm not that kind of lawyer. You can really taste the beef in that lobster. Okay. Here we go. This is the big number that's supposed to impress me and... (He looks at the paper) whoa, that's a BIG number. Hey, I'm going to, uh, try to remain cool. But you know Patrick Swayze?! Okay, no. Jeff, this is all very impressive, but I just don't think that... Family money? No, hum, not that I know of. I do have an uncle who owns a, a pretty successful bait shop. Actually, I want to have four kids."
672,3,6,narrator ,"It was a quiet november afternoon in 2007. I was working from home, because, you know, no distractions. The NRDC, or natural ressources defense council, fought for preserve american clean water, fresh air and to preserve's america's wilderness. It was Marshall's dream job. Marshall had an interview (Picture of a building) at a firm called Nicholson, Hewitt and West. (Video of a factory unit) They represented, well, pretty much everybody Marshall was going to sue (Video of a tree in the process of uproot) once he started at the NRDC. Marshall was thrown. This guy seemed nice. Of course, he wasn't. He was surely doing a tough decision. Now, kids, when I'm faced with a tough decision, I like to make a list of pros and cons. Marshall knew all cons. (We see the list. Pros: Money, Security, Swayze. Cons: Evil.) But there is one thing he didn't know, a big guy live in a pros con. Cause Robin was about to ask Lily the one question... That Lily had been dreading for years. That's when Lily showed Robin her box of shame."
673,3,6,robin ,"Oh, congratulations, Marshall! Oh, is that him? Cause that Ted Mosby really knows what he's doing. Oh, no! No, I meant, that Ted Mosby, he really knows what he's doing. Like all Ted Mosbys. (to Marshall) Wow, NRDC! Way to go, Marshall. Apparently you can. I know what kind of plane this is. It's a ""boing"". Oh, I do see that. Wow. That's 42 movies a month. Who is he, Jude Law? Right? He makes a lot of movies. I mean, not so much lately, but maybe, like, two years ago, you couldn't go to a movie without... So are you gonna go to dinner with him?

He's gonna be signing autographs tomorrow night in Manhattan at something called the Adult Video Expo. Lily, you're a kindergarten teacher? And you make a kindergarten teacher's salary, right? Well, how do you afford all of these expensive clothes? Lily?"
674,3,6,ted ,"What are you... What you're talking about? Oh, it's the same exact spelling as my name. Oh my God. This totally explains the thing at my doctor's the other day. This is really bizarre. The only other famous Mosby I know was a confederate general during the civil war. You got the job! Oh, yeah! Congrats, buddy. Yeah, it really is. Uh, no. No, navigators have three stripes on their hats. Captains have four. That guy's a captain. No, that's not him. What do you mean, ""that"" Ted Mosby really knows what he's doing? Who is this guy? Are we related? Do, do I look like him? Ah, ah, very funny, Wendy. Now we know you watch p*rn. (She leaves) This Ted Mosby must be getting kind of famous. Shh. Adult Video Weekly? Oh, no... Hello? Oh my God! (To Marshall and Lily) AVW? It's architecture vision weekly. Well, I don't want to say it's my project. I mean, I'll be working with at least three partners. Yeah. Yeah. I'm really looking forward to it. I mean, I know they're gonna ride me pretty hard but they're great guys. That interview went on for 20 more minutes. What? Okay, this is getting creepy. Who, who is this guy? I gotta find him."
675,3,6,wendy ,"And here's you water, in case you're dehydrated, Ted Mosby."
676,3,6,,"[Flashback - At the doctor's - Ted/Ted doctor's]The doctor: Open wide. I guess you're more used to saying that hearing it, huh, Ted Mosby? [End Flashback]Ted: Who is this guy? And why my doctor watching p*rn? Jeff:There's also a signing bonus, uh, use of a company car, expense account, blah, blah, blah. Hey, by the way, turn around and wave to Patrick Swayze."
677,3,7,all ,Cheers! Chug! chug! chug! chug! drink it! yes! Well done. Nice! yeah!
678,3,7,bank employee," Great, that is great  okay! All right, back to business. All right, MRS Aldrin, i'm going to need your social as well.  Yes, but since you're a married couple, you'll be applying for a joint loan, so.  Got it! Let's see what kind of rate i can get you 2.  There we go, Congratulation you've been approved for a loan at 18%.  you're lucky to be getting mortgage.  You have quite a bit of debt.  Okay, actually, it's because of your wife's credit card debt."
679,3,7,barney ,"Well, I love commitment. I wish i could marry commitment. I met a girl last night. So perky and full of life and not at all fake. C! And that wasn't spanish, that was cup size! What up! Mmmm... All right, Ted. Imagine the heads of two Irish babies. Let's call them...(bbllluuuuu) and (bllluuu) Pay up! p*ssy! I see. Between you and me, i'm also interested in this apartment. So is there any way i could come back later and check it out while you'rte showing them other places? Ted, do you think i have no morals whatsoever? I simply want to fool a girl into thinking this is my apartment so i can nail her once and never have to see her again. I'm not a monster! Welcome to my humble abode. Ah, make yourself at home. Please get comfortable. If you see something you like, just take it. Uh... That's my parents. Yeah! They're a chinese couple that wanted a white baby, it works both ways. Cookie? You got me. My sisters taught me how to bake and how to listen. I'm glad. Sometimes, i don't. A place like this really needs a lady of the house. I know it's early to be thinking of you as... Oh, God, i'm freaking you out, aren't I? It's just you make me feel so safe. I didn't..."" Yeah, we spent the night. Hey, look at you. The only thing missing from that bathrobe are your initials. Only if she sleeps in the bed and i sleep on the couch. I love you. There, i said it and i'm not taking it back. How about you get in the shower, and i will make us some waffles. Works at every time. Yup! Yeah. That little guy saw some stuff i'm not proud of. Don't touch the evidence. (to Ted) I got your back partner. If you wwant to get to the bottom of this, you're gonna need a stronger stomach than that, doll face. What do you think, make obsess? I'll just, uh, take this down to the lab. (He wants to take the wonderbra. Robin grab it from him). Ah! Robin, just... Just... Robin, just... They can't... get divorced. The world needs Marshall and Lily... together... I'm not crying, there's something in my eye. I know, it's a terrible idea. You can't do it. Just look at me. Oh, thank God. Cause, i mean, if you did then who'd be the lame married couple i get to make fun of? Like 'Hey Marshall, you're married mrs right, you just didn't know her first name was Always.' That stuff is cold."
680,3,7,cab driver," Oh, that's just the plant. Don't worry, they shut it down on the weekends.  Don't you know? Baby, this whole neighborhood is downwind of the sewage treatment plant.  I said, we're downwind of the sewage treatment plant."
681,3,7,girl ,I'm wearing your bathrobe. I hope you don't mind. My mom's gonna be in town next week. It's okay if she stays with us? You're so sweet. Oh my god! I love you too. I'm finally not the first one to say it!
682,3,7,girls ,Merci papa (en francais)
683,3,7,lilly ,"Marshall, there's something i have to tell you, and i want you to hear it from me first."
684,3,7,lily ,"Please stop! I thought you were shaving your face! Actually, I left the lid open. Sorry baby. Oh yeah, but that one's not for rent. It's for sale! what? Hy! My name is Lily and I'm a shopaholic. I buy designer clothes and accessories that i can't afford. I have 15 creditcards and they're all maxed out. And no one outside of this room, not even my husband, knows. And i feel terrible because all i want to do right now is ask you (to a girl of the meeting) where you got those shoes? They're adorable. we can't buy, we have debt. I forgive you. Well... I'm just saying as your wife, you know i'm cool that you spent tens of thousands of dollars on a brand name law school because i know it make you feel good and pretty. Where is it? Dowisetrepla? O right Dowisetrepla! No, i'm from New york. I know this neighborhood. I'm down in the D-town. Sounds great boys! Who wants chocolate pancakes? I know. It's... Isn't it amazing? Waddington? meters? I know, i know, i know, i know! But what do i tell him? You really don't know Marshall at all. Oh Marshall, can i talk to you? Marshall, i just... I don't know if now is the right time to buy."" oh persephone! oh daphne! these'll be perfect additions to our upcoming mother-daughter exhibit at the Met. I love it, but Marshall, i should have told you this long time ago. We can't afford to buy an apartment because i have too much credit card debt. I am so sorry. I love it. Let's get it. (to the agent) Can we charge it? I know what you're thinking. I should tell Marshall the truth. I've got the whole thing figure out. We'll apply for the loan under Marshall's name, and he'll never need to know. And then in the meantime, i'll slowly work down my debt, right after i furnish the apartment. I saw this amazing leather sofa today. What? Why? I mean, you already have Marshall's. Well, can we just go ahead and do it in my husband's name? He's the head of the household. He earns the big bucks. I mean, can women even own property? Okay my... my social is, uh... 1glmmdhgj2. Let's get out of here, Marshall. We have an annoucement. Ow, I should explain. We got in a pretty big fight. Marshall stormed out. Still drinking that? Listen, i've been thinking about this, and i know there's no way to undo what i've done, but, well, I made an appointment with a divorce lawyer. Oh no no! no, no, no No! I just mean on papers, so that you can buy the apartment without my bad credit dragging us down. I'm sorry, i shouldn't have led with the divorce lawyer part. I love you too, and i want us to have our dream home. And well, i don't know, it seems like this is a way to do it. So Marshall Eriksen, will you divorce me? So is that a yes? You can't sleep with other women though. No! We're home on earth! Yeah! There it is! Our new home! We shall. Oh! what a horrible smell. Wh-what plant? What are you talking about?"
685,3,7,marshall ,"Guys, it's 3:00 in the morning and it reeks in here. Ted! How many times have i asked you to put the lid back on the peanut butter jar? (Ted wants to speak but Marshall goes on) It's this sort of incoiderate, immature jackassery that makes me feel like i'm living in the Realworld house, and not the early years when they all had jobs and social consciences. I'm talking about Hawaii and after! I can't take this anymore! Hey, here's one. Private building, recently renovated, hardwood floors, tons of light, two bedroom, 2 bath. Oh right! You should buy a place! Baby, real estate is always a good investment! And the market is really hot right now. And because of my new job, we are in such a strong place financially. Yeah, i know, my sudent loans are pretty big. What? Let's just go take a look at this place. Uh, it's in a neighborhood called... Dowisetrepla? O, Actually we live on the Upper West side, so... I'm, I'm gonna stop you right there. Dont bother with the hard sell. This place is, is way out of our price range, and besides, we've only just started to looking. Thank you guys for coming down here so quickly. No, Dude. This is dowisetrepla. yeah! pffff (to the estate agent) he's from Ohio. (to Ted) Dowisetrepla is the up-and-coming neighborhood. I think this right the place where lily and i start a family, I can see it now. All right, bring it home, boys! Man, life is gonna be sweet! I see what you're doing here. ""another couple"", please, that crap is page one out of the Realtor's playbook. And we're not buying it. Another couple? No! We want it. Sell it to us. We'll give you so much more money. But we're not doing this for now, we're doing this for our future. Can't you imagine starting a family here? Looks great girls. Who wants crapes of Yes! I've been staring at that thing for years. Wendy, bring me the comically large bottle of champagne. Honey, once you've made the sale, stop selling. Wait! That cork is the size of a softball and you're pointing it directly at Wendy the waitress's face. Hey, uh, can we get this in singles? Before we get the apartment i want to put in a kiddie pool and swim around in it naked. (laugh) Thank you. Go ahead, just give him your social. Under six percent, under six percent, please No way. That-that can't be right. Hold it, I- i don't understand. Did we do something wrong or...? My student loans. Great. I thought we were friends. you know what, it's fine to penalize me for trying to get an education and bud a career, but i will not let you deprive my beautiful wife of her dream home just because i... Hey, hey guys. I went, uh, to the bar. I paid for it. And apparently money's tight now, so... What?! What?! You want a divorce now? Lily... are you trying to k*ll me? No, you shouldn't have! I love you, Lily. That's the sweetest divorce proposal i've ever heard. No we're not getting divorced, not even on paper. Lily, when i married you, i married your problems too. The ones i knew about and the ones i didn't. So that was the deal, we'll figure this out together. (They kiss, the waitress comes) I just got off the phone with the Realtor. We told her that, uh, because of our finances, we're not getting the place. It's just --it's not the right time. Ow this is exciting! Shall we? It reeks! Wait... What did you just say?"
686,3,7,meg ,"Yeah i thought i was gonna get married to my last boyfriend but, boy, did that guy have commitment issues! That whole relationships, that 3 weeks of my life i'll never get back."
687,3,7,narrator ,"everybody make mistakes. Take this girl Meg for instance She made a mistake, a mistake named Barney. When you get married you start out growing certain parts of your life; and for Lily and Marshall, those certain parts were, for the most part, me. Discontent was bubbling under this surface, until one day... But still, it was time to move forward. So they set out to find a new apartment to rent. Kids, uncle Marshall always like to say that he made 3 big mistakes in his life. This was the first (Marshall, when he was kid, on his roof with cardboard wings is going to jump). This was the second (Marshall shaves his head just before his weeding with lily). And this was the third and biggest. It's not! It wasn't. They weren't. 'Cause Lily had a secret. Is what Marshall should have said. Is what Marshall should have said. Is what she should have said. Is what he should have said. Is what Marshall should have said. Is what we should have said."

689,3,7,robiin ,Is that why my Yorkie trembled for like a week after i got back?
690,3,7,robin ,"Ted said it was okay. Hi, Lily. O, you guys don't do that here? sorry. (to lily) Proceed. Oh my god lily, have you seen this kitchen? What the hell are you doing? You can't buy this place; lily you have a debt of the size of Mount Waddington! It's the tallest mountain in Canada. It's like 4000 meters high. Ro, don't let Marshall fall in love with this apartment. I-I don't know, tell him, tell him you saw a ghost. Tell him it's haunted. you should be a reality show. Okay, let me get this straight. You just snuck this girl into some stranger's apartment? Wait. That time that you offered to walk my dogs when i went to visit my dad in Vancouver... Wh-what? What do you mean? Oh, God here we go. He had a detective club as a kid. The Mosby boys? You mean you and your sister. Let me guess, it was in the garbage. A water bott. Ew, that was on the floor. Hey, Ted! Which Is why this picture is crooked. I know what they've been fighting... I know what they were fighting about, and it wasn't peanut butter. They were fighting because they didn't get the loan and it's all Lily's fault. Yeah, she has a pile of debt the size of mount... Rushmore Well, it's been nice knowing you guys. Well, Marshall's gonna get yyou guys, Lily's gonna get me. It's a little weird. They're back. So you're not getting a divorce? So what's the annoucement?"
691,3,7,ted ,"Really? You're talking about her boobs, right? So these boobs... Paint me a word picture. Why could you come in? you hear me shaving! Well, clearly i wasn't! Ah, hey, Marshall. You're still up? Aren't you taking the bar tomorrow? I've never been to this neighborhood. Kind of thought this part of town was water Dowisetrepla? Is that an abbreviation for something? oh! Are you serious? You're trying to sneak this apartment away from Marshall and Lily? There was a fight here. Whenever Marshall and Lily have a big argument, they always leave a trail of evidence all over the apartment. HUm the Mosby boys cracked a lot of big cases. We solved the mystery of the missing retainer. Why are you like this? Anyway, this is serious. I know Lily and Marshall. All the tell tale signs are here. Like this It's not stiny water bottle. Notice the label is peed off. Just as i suspected, Cherry Garcia. Given the liquid consistency, i place the fight between... noon and 1. Marshall stood here. Eating and yelling, yelling and eating. Lily stood here. Crying. (Ted takes a handkerchief on the bar of the kitchen) And then Marshall tried to storm out... but Lily went for the Hail Marpass. There'd be a bigger mess. tempted as he was, Marshall was still too upset. Nice catch, Robin. Now that we need is a motive. The million dollar question what were they fighting about? bup bup bup bup bup... Theres's only one possible conclusion. Lily and Marshall are fighting about peanut butter. Lily left the lid off... (Ted put dark sunglasses) and marshall blew heads. I appreciate your help, but there's a reason your name is Robin, not Batman. What? Nice try Robin. So, the next thing Lily did was give Marshall a few hours to cool off about the peanut butter. Then she called him to apologize, which is why the last number dialed is... (Ted take the phone and see the last number) This can't be happening. Not Lily and Marshall, no way. What do you mean? Even if they break up, that doesn't mean we can't all hangout. I mean we broke up and we still hang out. It's not weird. Yeah, it is. It's weird. I hit redial on the phone. Divorce lawyers? Yeah, I know Wow, guys! You scared us."
692,3,7,the estate agent," No need to be embarassed, listen, here in New York we just shorten the names of all the neighborhood: soho, trybeka, nolita,...  Oh, well, nobody calls it D-town. Dowistrepla the up-and-coming neighborhood. And i have to tell you, for these prices you're not going to be able to find an other...  Oh, they're on vacation in France for 2 weeks.  The lockbox combination is 1421, and here's my card.  Now, listen, i don't want to put a lot of pressure on you, but there is one other couple that expressed very serious interest  So...

700,3,9,barney ,"No way! March does not have 31 days. I gotta go. What? I'm sorry. Did you just say Canadian Thanksgiving was and I'm quoting,""the real Thanksgiving""? What do Canadians even have to celebrate about? Why are you guys even a country? Well, there, you said it again. Slapsgiving. no. No, no. The countdown ends at 3:00 p.m., the day after Thanksgiving. I counted it out. Uh, thirty. Damn it! Wait, you're gonna slap me on Thanksgiving? That's not allowed. Lily, you're the slap bet commissioner, is that allowed? Well, you know what? If you're trying to freak me out about spending Thanksgiving... Right. Cause you blew it. The worst part about getting slapped is not knowing when it's going to happen. But now I know exactly when I'm gonna get slapped. So, you took all the suspense out. You showed your hand. Nothing but respect for that man. Yeah, I'll be there, absolutely. Hey, say no more. I mean, when I pulled you out of that burning wreckage, I wasn't doing it to have a battleship named after me. But if you insist, yes, I'll be there for the christening. No, I'm not going to wear the medal of honor. That would just be tacky. No, no. Thank you, mr. President. (He hungs up) Sorry. Please, you took out all the suspense. In a horror movie, the killer does not grab a bullhorn and announce, ""Attention unsupervised teens here at the lake house: at precisely 3:00 a.m., I'm gonna jump out of that closet right there and hack you all up with a machete. P.S. fire is my one weakness."" Exactly. And you know why? Because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about, especially around the holidays. I mean, what decent human being would want to cause any kind of emotional or physical pain... Ooh. terrible. She's got you making pies for this guy? Relapse five! That's where we high-five, then it's awkward for a little bit... and then we high-five again! Um, most Thanksgivings. I'm not scared. Please don't slap me. Oh, God! don't slap me again! I don't want to get slapped again, and the first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it! I don't like it one bit! Well, you didn't ruin it; you made it so much worse! I can't eat. I can't sleep. I've lost ten pounds; my suits are wearing me. You know what? I'm outta here. Why can't I?! Nowhere in the rules does it say that I have to sit through sort of mental torture! You are allowed to slap my face, Sir, but you are not allowed to slap my mind! Good day! Yes! In your face! Not my face... your face! Marshall, you're not eating. Did something spoil your slap-petite? I thought we were done with that? Hey, check it out! We're in the last 20 seconds of Marshall's countdown to nothing. How does it feel, Marshall,to sit there, impotently... your large, flaccid hand,just dangling in the wind? Ooh, classy touch, dude. Too bad! I will in... five... What?! Wait, you..."
701,3,9,bob ,"Hey, sweetie. Hey, dudes,what's crackin'?. Good to meet you. Sorry I'm late. I just got off the phone with my parents. They were totally on my case: ""What are you gonna do with your life? You're forty-one."" and I'm like, ""Chillax, snowboarding is a legit career. you ought to be stoked I found my bliss."" and speaking of bliss,sugar me, baby. ( Robin and Bob kiss) What's up, dudes? Not too grownup. I made jell-o shots. We're gonna get silly, bitches. This is rad! A nice, small,simple Thanksgiving. I'm the youngest of ten in my family, so our Thanksgiving is a mess. All the yelling and the screaming... It's really a major buzz-kill."
702,3,9,lily ,"Isn't it sad? I mean in 2007, some countries actually still condone corporal punishment. Peeing. All right,we have a turkey. Isn't this exciting? Our first Thanksgiving together as a group. Bob? You've been on, like, three dates with that guy. We haven't even met him. Yes. This is our first Thanksgiving. 30 years from now, we're going to look at the photos and say, ""Oh, there's the four people I love most in the world... and Bob."" The hostess in me who's using her wedding china for the first time wants to say hell, no, but yeah, I 'm going to allow it. What are you talking about? He's forty-one.he looks great. Oh, by the way, we're all baking pies at robin's tomorrow. Marshall can't be trusted in the apartment with pies overnight. 7:30. Oh, marshall, are you working on the cranberry sauce? Yeah, some people just can't take a hint. By the way, I'm really swamped in here. Uh-huh. I'm not sure I have time to mash those potatoes, you're standing right next to. Yep. masher's right there, next to the pot. How do you respond to something like that? No, Ted! What are you doing? That is a terrible idea! What the hell were you doing? Let's review: you and Ted broke up six months ago. You're dating another man... Why are you trying to destroy American Thanksgiving?! Well, did you guys at least talk about it? You know what? That's it! This is Thanksgiving. Solve this right now. And if you have s*x again, neither of you gets dessert! Oh, what the hell kind of Thanksgiving is this anyway? Thanks, baby. Ooh, some classical music, maybe. No! It's not! It's Thanksgiving! Our first one as a married couple, as grownups and you're not even trying to be a part of it! None of you are! So... as slap bet commissioner, I'm issuing a ruling. Thanksgiving is a day of peace. There will be no slaps today! The slap bet commissioner's word is final, so get in the kitchen and mash some potatoes, now. And for the rest of the day, we are going to enjoy a civilized, grownup holiday. Nope. This sucks. Eat up and leave. Oh, no... Barney, put it away. Barney, put it away. You can slap him. Well, guys have fun."
703,3,9,marhall ,Really?
704,3,9,marshall ,"Yes, it does! Everyone knows that. It's like general knowledge. Oh, man, I got a kernel stuck in my teeth. But after the first year,I get a major pay raise. I'm gonna go pay. Yeah, we do. Yeah, this is gonna be the best Slapsgiving ever. I said this is going to be the best Thanksgiving ever. Oh, hey, by the way, if anyone wants to come over early thursday, we can watch the Slapsgiving day parade. Said what? Oh, I guess I did. You know why? I've invented a new holiday: Slapsgiving. It's the one day we set aside each year to gather together and give slaps. Slapsgiving. Slapsgiving. And thursday at 3:01 p.m., your face is going to show my hand. Yeah, du he's in pretty good shape. He could probably kick your ass. For the millionth time, sleep-eating is a very serious and delicious medical condition. In a minute, baby. I've only got so many hands. You see what I got going on here? They're turkeys, but they're also hands, because later, we're going to eat turkey... and then i'm going to slap you in your face. What do you mean something weird happened last night? You're still getting slapped. That is a real slap in the face. Horrible idea. Oh, no! The slap-petizers. Don't stress, baby. I'll try to find us something relaxing. Oh, my! Look at that. That means we're in the final hour of the countdown. Then why is your right cheek twitching? It's not... maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard, it reverberates back to the present, shattering the time-slap continuum. I'm sorry, what? I thought I ruined it by putting a clock on it, Barney? Well, no, no, no. you can't leave. But it's Slapsgiving. What?! Baby,please... -no! No, i just thought...before we eat, maybe the chef would like to say a few words. Well, then, I'd like to say something. If that's cool? Um... today, Lily did something great. Not only did she gather us all here together and cook a delicious meal, but she also started a new tradition. We're gonna do this again next year, and the year after that... maybe for the rest of our lives. I think that's pretty amazing if you think about it. And it's all thanks to you,Lily. I love you. So, to the first of many Thanksgivings together. That's three! Thanks, baby, you're the best. And as a special, added bonus, I've composed a song just for this occasion. Ted, lights! (Marshall starts playing the piano and singing) *What is this feelin' that's put you in your place a hot, red burnin' on the side of your face you feel the blood rush to your cheek. Tears start to fill your eyes and your lips are tremblin' but you can't speak,you're tryin', oh, you're tryin' not to cry! You just got sla-apped-oh, oh! Across the face, my friend-oh, oh, oh! You just got slapped. Yes, that really just happened. Everybody saw it and everybody laughed and clapped, it was awesome. Wait,you just got... slapped. Happy Slapsgiving, everybody.* Oh man, we're gonna be doing this all the time, now aren't we?"
705,3,9,robin ,"I'm gonna help lily pee. Oh, uh, that reminds me, I invited Bob. Well, he didn't have anywhere else to go, and I didn't know what to say. Is it really that big a deal? I'm sorry,sometimes I forget how seriously you guys take American Thanksgiving. Real thanksgiving happened over a month ago. Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find the northwest passage. Oh, there's Bob! By the way, heads up, he's a little bit older than us. He's forty-one. Hey, bob! Over here! Hi. Let's go get a drink. Uh, they just called. They're both super swamped preparing for tomorrow. No, he went to see green day. Making pies. Yeah, they do. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, ted. You, too. Is lily in the kitchen? Great. Lily? I yawned like a million times trying to get him to leave. I kept looking at the clock and sighing... totally clueless. And then Ted does the thing that he always does when there's an awkward silence. He panics and says the first thing that pops into his head. Hey, did you know that the first pies in recorded history came from Ancient Egypt? I'd already broken the ice with my cool pie fact. then he makes it ten times more awkward. Did you know that the egyptian pyramids can be seen from space? Probably? Okay, um... the pecan pie is gonna take the longest. Why don't we put that one in first? Um, it's my favorite. I know. I just like smelling it. It's like eating with your nose. Yeah. Yeah, I-I just thought it might upset you. I don't know. Is it so ridiculous to think that you might be? Why? Right? Come on. Ted... He's 41! Why are you bashing on him so hard? It's mean. First of all, Bob and I are not sleeping together. We're just dating. Secondly, have I said one word about the parade of dubious conquests you've been marching past me the last few months? One of whom got you a butterfly tattoo? And if you and I are such good friends... why is baking a pie for Bob so weird? Well, what are we doing? It's Thanksgiving. I'm sorry, too. Of course we're friends. I'm glad we're friends. You are correct, Sir. That is a truth-fact. kablammo. Oh, Lily, it's not as bad as it sounds. Bob and I aren't that serious, and what happened last night with Ted was a fluke. I hear something burning... Clearly, we need to talk about this. We need to talk. We need to talk about last night. Ted, can we please just deal with this? Look, I'm not mad. I just think... What?! you're crazy! Only because your hand was still around my waist. I... leaned into it? Oh, that was you in little league, wasn't it? Look at us! We can't be alone together, can we? What does that mean? We're supposed to be friends. Well, maybe we should stop pretending. So... what do we do now? Okay. I guess we're not. That's the general idea."
706,3,9,ted ,"So then this hot intern leans over my desk, I can totally see she has a pierced... (Robin and Lily walk across the room) Brosnan. Pierce brosnan is my favorite of all the bonds. I'm gonna help marshall pay. yeah, this is going to be great. Just the five of us, right? How many days are in october? Dude, I thought we cleared this up last year. Is also tomorrow. How old is he? Hey, man, how are you? Parents? Unbelievable. Robin is dating Orville Redenbacher. How are you guys not seeing this? He's 150; Robin's 27. Barney, come on,what do you got? Hey, uh, what time are you guys going to robin's? Perfect. Just to be safe, I'll get there like 8:00, 8:30. Sorry I'm late. Where are Marshall and Lily? Is Bob coming? So it's... Pies. They're things that friends make together. Great. Great. Well, this is great. It'll give us a chance to catch up. I'm going to make a phone call. (On the phone with Barney who is at the Bar) Hey, it's me. listen, you have to come over here and make pies. Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver. It's still kind of weird being alone with Robin, but if you were here... You're hitting on someone right now, aren't you? So you're not coming to make pies. Hey, happy Thanksgiving. yep. Marshall? You may not realize this, but since we broke up, Robin and I have never really been alone together. So we're in the kitchen, starting on the pies, and we realize, we don't have a damn thing to say to each other. I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now. You just feel like everything you say is gonna make things worse. I wanted to leave, but i couldn't stick her with making all the pies by herself. She was exhausted. Remember last year's Thanksgiving, when we had s*x seven times? What?! I thought it would break the ice. Ooh, the oven's pre-heated! Pecan pie? Why are we making that? You're allergic. So we're making a pie for Bob. Yeah. You know, you could have just told me it was for Bob. Upset me? Wait a second. Do you think that......Do you think that I'm jealous of Bob? Yes. Because he's a thousand years old. The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that we can only talk about the first Thanksgiving, The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is because I heard noah gave him shotgun in the ark. The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that I'm just an architect, but he discovered fire. How do you top that? I'm not. I'm just joking around. That's what friends do. Well, how come we're all allowed to bust on barney when he dates some skanktron, but when you sleep with the crypt keeper's dad, I'm not allowed to say a word? Hey, that is... Yeah, if you and i are such good friends, why couldn't you just tell me that's what we were doing? Okay, maybe we should talk about this later. I-I should get going. I don't know. I'm sorry. This is stupid. me, too. Clearly, we need to ignore this. Stuffed mushroom? Did you know that some mushrooms are carnivorous? Probably... not? Wait, wait, wait, wait. why would you be mad... you started it? We called a truce, we hugged, and when I tried to pull away, you kept your hand on my neck. Oh, come on! You leaned into it. Yeah. You're like the crappy kid in little league who knows he's not going to make contact, so he just...""Oops, I got hit by the pitch. Better take my base."" My on-base percentage was off the charts! Apparently not. We aren't friends, are we? Not really. We avoid each other. We smile politely. We're two people who pretend to be friends because it would be inconvenient not to. Maybe we should. I suppose... we eat dinner. And then that's it. Happy Thanksgiving. Guess we're not. This is gonna be majoy cleaner."
707,3,9,ted and robin,...just the two of us.  Something really weird happened last night.  You know? to save the friendship.  Major buzz-kill.
708,3,9,voice ,The slap will occur in ten..
709,3,9,,"Ted from 2030: Back when we were dating robin and I had this running joke. We were the only two people in the world who found it funny. Ted & Robin: General knowledge. Ted from 2030: And we did it all the time. Ted & Robin: Corporal punishment. Ted from 2030: Because once you start, it's surprisingly hard to stop. Ted & Robin: Colonel stuck-in-my-teeth. Ted from 2030: But now, we were broken up,so when Marshall said... Ted from 2030: We just let it slide. You see, on the surface, Robin and I looked like we were doing great. But the truth is, trying to be friends with your ex is a lot harder than it looks. You can't be as candid as you used to be. Ted from 2030: But most importantly, you can never, ever be alone together. Ted from 2030: I should explain. Kids, you remember the slap bet a year earlier, Marshall made a bet with Barney and won the right to slap him five times. He had already used the first and the second. But Marshall had something special in store for the third. Marshall, on the phone with Barney: slapcountdown.com. Barney, with a funny accent: I like Halloween very much. Is nice. Barney:...at your place, then you failed. Truth is, I'm not scared. Ted from 2030: Okay, kids, the truth is, Bob probably looked like this. Ted from 2030: But when your ex is dating someone new your mind tends to accentuate their flaws. This is how I saw bob. Ted from 2030: After a very long night, it was finally the big holiday. Sorry, the two big holidays. Lily, Marshall and Barney: You guys slept together last night? Lily:...who's coming to my thanksgiving today... Lily:...an event Ted is also attending. Ted:: There's office material... Ted from 2030: So we sat down to our first Thanksgiving together as a group...and, apparently, our last. Ted from 2030: And then a funny thing happened... Ted from 2030: You see kids, friendship is an involuntary reflex... It just happens,you can't help it. That first Thanksgiving turned out to be a wonderful dinner with the four people I love most in the world... and Bob and it did become a tradition. That's why every year,we go to aunt Lily and uncle Marshall's for Thanksgiving. Voice:...six... Voice:... five, four... Voice:...three... Voice:...two...one."
710,3,11,a man," Oh, hey! You must be our new neighbors. I'm Michael."
711,3,11,a women, and i'm laura.
712,3,11,all ,"Ted, why would you do that? NO! no, no, don't do it! Oh no! oh you are kidding me?! What?!"
713,3,11,barney ,"oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp! what? what's matter with you? Dude... don't poop where you eat. You've heard of the golden rule, right? ""love their neighbor?"" Damn it Ted, i've worked out this whole thing where the golden rule is ""love thy neighbor"", ok?... Now the golden rule is ""love thy neigbor"". But, there's one rule above it: the platinum rule: ""never ever, ever, ever, love thy neighbor."" Need i remind you about me and Wendy the waitress? good, then we've got a solid half hour. And in that time, we will convince you not to set foot out that door. It's a story older than time, my friend, and it always plays out in the same eight steps. Step 1: Attraction. It's true. 12 of them. Thanks. The attraction is instant and undeniable. But you know better. You've seen your friends make the same mistakes before. You've laughed smugly at them.(laughs) Idiots! But still, you think, ""this is different. The platinum rule doesn't apply to me."" And that step 2! Bargaining. That's the couples version of dating. Need i remind you what happened with me and Wendy the waitress? I've decided to seduce Wendy the waitress. Request denied! What rule is there that say's i can't seduce the waitress at my favorite bar? Well, i don't. I don't have one and i never will be because it's a great idea. Come on, guys! She's gullible. I'm bored. We're perfect for each other. yeah, well... I think it'll be okay. And it was a huge mistake. Ted, trust me. You don't want to do this. That's what everyone thinks and then along comes step 3: Submission. Good night! Not at all. Club soda can get anything off. hey, can i get a gin and tonic? oh, i paid for it. Oh, Ted, of course there's an upside. At first, that's step 4: Perks. What the opposite of name-dropping? you just go across the hall? (Marshall agreed) That's what i thought. you don't have... (Wendy the waitress comes and serves food to Barney) Come on, guys, free nachos. What? I'm not k*ll*ing the bar. Wendy the waitress has seen how i operate in this place. It is perfectly clear to everyone involved that this is nothing more than a temporary fling. (Wendy starves him, lovely) It's fiiine. But it wasn't. Which brings us to step 5: THE TIPPING POINT. hey, Wendy, uh, do me a favor and send a glass of champagne to that pretty young girl over there. over there... YOU... you're the pretty young thing...is what i meant. Champagne? Would you? on me. okay. All right. which brings to step 6. Don't do this Ted. Which brings us to step 6. You finally realize you've made a huge mistake and now you have to live with it. Step 6 is called purg... wait for it. Keep waiting. Keep waiting for the eternity only to dicover there's no escap-atory. Yeah! I remember that. How could you guys let me date Wendy the waitress? tss (He looks at a girl but Wendy is right behind, she smiles, he looks desperate) Now look at me. Declawed. Neutered. What was once my jungle is now my zoo and i am forced to mate with the same old lioness again, and again, and again while families pay to watch. Put a bell around my neck and scratch my belly kids, for i am just a docile housecat now. Miaou! And so, inevitably, you have to do the thing you've been dreading all along. Now, a relationship-ectomy is a delicate surgery as it is, but in the case of the platinum rule, it takes a very, very steady hand, and that's step 7: CONFRONTATION. I don't like you. I mean, i don't like you that way. I used to like you that way but now that i've seen everything there is to see, i don't know, i kind of want to see those same parts just on other girls. other girls and you, if you're into that but the other girls have to be there, too. That's the important part. or that. Let's say it's that. So can i get a gin and tonic? And in any other relationship, that would be it. End of story. But because you have to see this person again, there's a step 8: FALLOUT. Thanks Wendy. Of course we can. She's gonna try to k*ll me. This is poisoned. Yours is poisoned too. She's trying to k*ll me and everyone close to me. Ted! Look at the facts. I dump her and she says ""no hard feelings"". She's a psycho! What other explanation is there? Where did Marshall get that hamburger? You're welcome. Yet. What? Ted, have you not been listening? Attraction, bargaining, submission, perks, tipping point, purgatory, confrontation, fallout! These things will all happen to you as surely as they happened to all of us! It's a rule of nature. Exactly, the platinum rule. Stella reads my blog. Thanks. (She leaves and he throws the drink) Crazy!"
714,3,11,curt ,"Hockey. Robin! I got 2 tickets to the rangers. Center ice. Want to go? Oh, so you're talking to me now? I'm talking about last night. You said you'd call and you didn't. I missed you and i waited up, but you didn't call. That really hurts. I'm sorry Sweetie. I don't want to fight tonight. It's our first weekiversary. (he hugs her) Well, the Knicks lost. It's sad, really. They had a real shot. Then, out of nowhere, game over. And why? Why Robin? The knicks lost because they were afraid of getting hurt. So they didn't even try. Well, you know what i think? I think the knicks didn't deserve my love to begin with. Kincks suck! (He gets out, on tears) Good night."
715,3,11,laura ,"Do you guys know any good brunch places around here? and then we discover the movers lost all our kitchen boxes. We don't have a single pot or pan. We bought all the fixings for a mexican fiesta. What do you say? Hey, neighbors. We're going to have a few friends over."
716,3,11,lily ,"oh, but Ted, if you get rid of the butterfly, how's everyone gonna know you're a stripper fron reno with daddy issues? Stella? and in this case, you're paying them... then yes, it counts. We love brunch! Robin, it's a mistake. Remember what happened with me and Marshall? The Gerards across the hall? Michael and LAura. They're awesome. We're gonna invite them over for dinner. we're not gonna date them. We're just gonna be friends with them. I don't know. I'd expect you to have one already. And it was a huge mistake. Want to have dinner with us tonight? That's what we thought. And it's so conveniant. They're right across the hall. Say it's sunday and we want to have a brunch double date with someone. And say we want to have a dinner party exploring the wine and cuisine of France's Loire Valley. Say we want to play a game of charades... Come on people, get excited for us! We've got a great thing going here. You're k*ll*ing the bar. But it wasn't. um, well, we actually have tickets... Every time we step out the door, they're out there waiting for us. Sometimes, we'll send Ted out first as a scout. Nobody's there. Then we'll go out one second later, and there they are. ""Hey neighbor!"" ""Hey, neighbor""""Hey neighbor."" We said ""don't do it!"" Well, we love this bar. You can't dump her. Marry her if you have to. We're getting a little sick of charades. Do you see anything? ok go go go. (They go out but the door of the Gerards opens, they gets in quickly) Too close. (Someone knocks on the door) You've got to be kidding me. What do we do? It's just Ted! Okay, hurry! (They come down to the rescue ladder) Michael and Laura are probably... Oh, sorry Ted. So what do you guys have going on tonight?"
717,3,11,marshall ,"If it's someone you see on a regular basis, and you can't avoid them... Oh, yeah, and remember what happened with us and the gerards across the hall? That's not even possible. There's no way. Oh, hi, welcome to the building. Yeah. Don't k*ll the bar, dude. yeah, well, i think it'll be okay. We just go across the hall. We just go across the hall. Dude, you got to flick it. Don't k*ll the bar, dude. Don't k*ll the bar, dude. It's fine. on my suggestion, you... (Barney looks at a girl) Dude, actually, we made other plans, so... okay (Michael mimes) one word. 2 syllables. Sounds like... parades: charades. yeah. I remember that. Ro! we are such idiots! It's freakin' supernatural. Are they ghosts? Can only we see them? Don't k*ll the bar dude! don't k*ll the bar dude. guys, we like you a lot... Maybe we should just go back to being neighbors. I think we're clear. That was close. I have no idea. (it knocks again) Wait! (He looks at the judha: Ted is alone) Baby, we only have one choice. Dude. So what do you mean ""it wasn't a date""? Why would she think that? Have fun."
718,3,11,michael ,"Guess we're ordering take-out. hey, neighbors. and no fiesta would be complete without charades! gonna play some charades."
719,3,11,narrator ,"kids, too often in life, we make decisions that we're not prepared to live with. (a man with a tattoo ""rex&evelyn forever"" cries) This is a story about those decisions, and the consequences that follow. (Ted is in the clinic, hidden derriere a newspaper) So Stella and i went on our date. But here's the funny thing: turns out, it wasn't actually a date. So that was the end of the story between me and Stella, at least for the time being. But i don't know, looking back on the platinum rule, i think there's a ninth step. We'll call it coexistence. It's the moment you realize that all that anger and resentment just isn't useful. and you start to let go of it. And move on with your life. It just takes a while."
720,3,11,productor ,and clear.
721,3,11,robin ,"Wait, Ted, Barney has a point. Remember what happened with me and curt down at the station? yeah! Oh, welcome. You look really familiar. Are you a former athlete? I think i've got a little crush on our sports guy. I know, i know but he used to play hockey, and i'm canadian. I can't help it. If he were missing some teeth, i probably would have already hit that. And you've got the couples version of the hots for them. Oh, yeah, you want to browse at pottery barn with them. You want to go antiquing with them, don't you? Oh, yeah, you want to antique the crap out of them. Yeah, with some sort of catchy name. Bar killer. yeah, well... I think it'll be okay. And it was a huge mistake. You have a butterfly tramp stamp. we can split a cab to work together. We always have a standing lunch date. And last night, at the hockey game, Curt got us into the locker room, and i met Mason Raymond. Left wing for the Vancouver canucks. Damn it you guys, be psyched. Yes, we see each other every day, but i think it's going really well. It's fine. But it wasn't. Thanks iron man we'll be right back. So you want to do something later? What are you talking about? oh, um, i'm sorry, i-i guess i just forgot. God, i'm such an idiot. Curt ""the iron man"" irons keeps leaving me love notes on post-its. On the teleprompter, on my desk, on the coffee-maker, on the jar of sugar packets next to the coffee-maker. The iron man. oh! Wendy the waitress hyphen Stinson. Curt, we need to talk. I like you... We're pretending this works, but it doesn't. And i'm getting a little sick of the whole charade. So maybe we could go back to just being coworkers. And now, here's Curt ""the iron man"" irons with sports. Curt? (he's demoralized) Curt? Uh, well, their perimeter sh**ting has been a little bit off this season... And that's sports. Wait a second. You've been sitting here, pretending to be the expert on all this, but the truth is, this was no real fallout from your breakup at all? You're an idiot. Did she see your tattoo and assume you were gay? Thanks for watching."
722,3,11,ted ,"I have a tattoo! a tramp stamp?! Say goodbye, kids, 'cause it won't be around much longer. (He shows his tattoo) yes, yes, enjoy these final moments of mockery because in just ten surprisingly expensive sessions, Stella is gonna zap that butterfly right off the face of my lower back. Dr Stella Zinman. She's the best in the business. And she's rather cute in fact. In fact... we're going to a movie together tonight. I asked her out. What? What do you mean? oh, no, this doesn't count. uh, actually, it's ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" It's from the bible. Well, that's cute. But she's not my neighbor, she's my doctor. So if you'll excuse me... yeah, i don't have time for this. I'm out the door as soon as i'm finished with my hair. This is NYC.You don't get close to the neighbors. You nod at them politely in the hall. You call the cops if you haven't seen them in a while and you smell something funny, and that is it. Barney, we love this bar. If you screxw over Wendy the waitress, you're going to k*ll the bar. yeah, well... I think it'll be okay. Look, Stella and i are adults; we're both smart, mature people capable of making good decisions. We're just seeing a movie. If it seems at all weird, i'll back off. See, i bet you didn't pay for that gin and tonic. But you got to admit, there is an upside to breaking the platinum rule. Like maybe as her boyfrien, i could get a discount on treatments. We like this bar. Barney, we love this bar. This bar is like home to us. Yeah, listen i'm leaving so if you want to write the rest of these down, i will read it tomorrow. You want to get out of the way? Don't do this Ted. Don't (He brushes his hair in a mess) Dude! ya! It was perfect! You're such a jerk! You've got a whole meat locker at home full of corpses, don't you? yeah, this metaphor's really falling apart. guys, are you here? I forgot my keys. Can you open up? Hello? Guys? (Marshall looks again and see the Gerards go out their apartment) waouh. I've got to hand it to Wendy the waitress that was very mature of her. What? You're being ridiculous. What are you talking about? Uh, that you're letting yourself believe she's crazy so you don't have to face the far more likely possibility that she doesn't want to date you either? I don't know, i guess Wendy the Waitress brought it to him. All right, i'm taking off. I have a date. (Barney brushes Ted's hair in a mess) You're such a jerk! Well, i'm sick of all the rules! There's too many of them! The hot/crazy scale, the lemon law, the platinum rule! If everyone in the world followed every one of your rules, the human race would cease to exist. Yes chances are to Stella and I are not going to live happily ever after the overwhelming odds have it ending badly. And when that happens, it'll be for one of a million possible reasons. But that doesn't mean i'm not gonna try. And when it does fail, so help me god, it's not gonna be because of some rule. (He watches himself in th mirror) PS: you just made my hair look awesome. Good night. (He leaves) She thought we were seeing a movie just as friends. Apparently, there's a rule that says i can't date Stella. No, this rule comes from the american medical association. Doctors aren't legally allowed to date their patients. It's okay. What are you guys watching?"
723,3,11,the host," You must be Robin.  Curt ""the iron man"" irons. I'm gonna be doing sports."
724,3,11,the others," Oh no, no guys guys! Are you insane?  No! Don't do it!"
725,3,11,wendy ,"Here's your gin and tonic. O gosh! Look at that. (She leaves scrubing a stain in her shirt, Barney starves at her with interest) Hey Barney! Carl had to take off. You mind giving me a hand? That was an intersting use of the beverage g*n. It finally happened, all this time, every drink i brought you... I always felt there was this unspoken connection between us. And i was right! Hi, sweetie. I had the kitchen whip these up, no charge. (They kiss) Okay. Bye. I mean, not bye. I'm not leaving. I'll be over there. okay. (She leaves) What? (Ted and Marshall starve Barney, anxious) Oh, okay, thanks sweetie. (She kisses him) Gosh, you're just terrified of ever getting close to anyone, aren't you? Barney, i just want you to know, i have no hard feelings. It wasn't the best idea for us to get involved. I hope we can still be friends. If you need anything else, let me know."
726,3,11,,"Lily and Marshall (laughing): Oh my god! Marshall(at the same time): Don't k*ll the bar. Curt:...but he should be back on the mound by spring training and that's sport. Back to you, Robin. Lily (reads a post-it): ""here's some sugar for my sugar."" Barney (in slow motion, comes towards Marshall): Noooooooo! (He throws his hamburger away) Marshall&Lily (to Michael&Laura): Hey guys! : On the house."
727,3,13,abby ,"Doctor, are you all right? I heard a woman screaming in here. Oh. (she starts laughing and leave) Sir, please don't yell at me, because when people yell at me, I have a tendency to start crying. Please don't do it. I am too busy to waste my time... (Abby finally hangs up) Oh, wow, thank you, that's so nice. You're like a knight. I should call you Sir Ted. Nothing. Nothing. (laughs nervously) It's really stupid. (She calls Stella, who is standing right behind her) Um, Dr. Zinman, Ted's here. Hi, Ted. I'll let her know. Ted, I found your book. Your book 'The Power of Me'. I think you accidentally dropped it in the garbage. No, you were reading it in the lobby. No, no, look right here. ""From the personal library of Ted Mosby."" That's you. Sure, what's it regarding? I-I don't understand. Sir, please don't yell at me because when people yell at me, I have a tendency to start crying. Please don't do that. Please. No. Oh, hi, Ted. Love the 'stache. You look like a young Tom Selleck, only a million times handsomer. Dr. Zinman, Magnum's here to see you. Just kidding. Stupid. All my friends told me, ""Abby, be strong. He doesn't deserve another chance."" But I forgive you! (She runs after Ted) Aren't you going to see the doctor about that mole? My mom was wrong. There are nice guys in New York. Well, then if it's fixed, can we can have s*x on it and then go shopping."
728,3,13,barney ,"Ted, do you know how long it takes a woman to decide whether or not she's going to sleep with a guy? 8.3 seconds. After that, her decision is made. She will not change her mind. Is it? Describe your first 8.3 seconds with Stella. Really, Ted? You think so? Well, tell me, how did the rest of that session go? You juggled? I thought you were trying to impress her. Magic's not lame. Is this lame? I... Yeah, but Ted provoked me. But... You can't turn a ""no"" into a ""yes,"" Ted. Can't be done. No, you didn't. You were like, ""No, we can't, we're friends. It would mess up the dynamic of the group."" Oh, right. I like this. Seduce the receptionist. That's a great plan. Who? Ted, every little boy wants to grow up to nail the doctor or the lawyer. Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist. Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, Ted. Your little Stella is not so perfect. I went down there and checked her out for myself. Yeah. And while I was down there, I discovered that she had a secret, a terrible... terrible secret. Hold on, I gotta pee. (He stands up et goes to the toilets) Okay, I'm back. What's going on at work? Oh. Oh, right. Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please. Oh, I just want to see her. Want to look at her, see what she looks like. I'm sorry, did I accidentally oprima numero dos when I called? Do you speak English? I want to see her! What are your credentials?! I want to know who am I speaking with! At first she seemed great, beautiful, smart, way out of your league. But then, I overheard this conversation. Folliculaphilia. Ted, your perfect woman can only be attracted to men with moustaches. You're right, Ted. I'm just making that up. Y-you don't remember? I'll bet anyone ten bucks I can get Ted to grow a moustache. I know. I would've done it for free. But, no. You owe me ten bucks. Wow. This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk. You know your problem? You're too sweet. Oh, yeah. Turns out it's just a Raisinet. Hey, how would you like me to take you out to a fancy restaurant and then go on a shopping spree? Treat you the way you should be treated. Would that make you forget about that Ted monster? We just have to go by my hotel room first. My bed was broken. I just have to make sure they fixed it. I like you."
729,3,13,lily ,"I think that's great, Ted. You can do whatever you set your mind to. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm going to stop biting my nails. I know, but I'm doing this for Ted. Hmm. God, this is really hard. Barney... We've talked about this. It's a fire code violation. No, no, you are on a time-out. Go sit over there. Go! You know, you can do this, Ted. I said that I would stop biting my nails, and kablam-ey. It's just a challenge. It can't be easy to woo someone while you're sticking your naked butt in their face. Ted. You just got to be yourself, no more gimmicks. No, you have to. She likes you. She said so herself. (clearing throat) I mean... I swear to you, I did not."
730,3,13,man ,We all got it. Ted's a schmuck.
731,3,13,marshall ,"Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail and a milk shake. But, baby, you love biting your nails. What the hell is wrong with you? Works for baboons. It's called ""presenting."" It's actually a great book. It taught me the power of complete memory. I left it somewhere... I forget. My wife's always getting on me about my dry elbows. So good to be in a relationship. Anyone special in your life? Or maybe just someone you're interested in? Interes-ted in? Irregular? Oh, my God. This is it. It's all over. Can you stop talking about your other patients?! I'm dying here, woman! Okay. Hey, what was it you were saying before about the guy with the butterfly tattoo? Oh. Okay. Thank you. Yes. Sorry, dude. Have a shrimp."
732,3,13,ranjit ,Hello! Hello! Hello! Good-bye!
733,3,13,robin ,"No... Hmm. What could she mean when she says 'no'? I don't know, it is totally cryptic. Wow, Roger Daltrey just rolled over in his grave. That's not the right guy, is it? He's not even dead, is he? Oh, Barney, no, no. We said no fireballs at the table. There's alcohol in here. I don't know, Barney. I mean, sometimes persistence pays off. I said ""yes"" eventually. To Ted. Ted, I hate to say this, but I think it's ""nail the receptionist"" time. I got it a little bit."
734,3,13,stella ,"Ah, the butterfly tramp stamp. My bread and butter. So I'm guessing that the real story involves a bad breakup and some booze. Unless it's a gang tattoo, in which case, I think it's time to find a new gang. Well, I can get rid of it in ten one-hour sessions, but, I should warn you, laser surgery's very painful. Oh, Plan 9 From Outer Space? Uh, I'm a doctor, went to medical school. It's Plan 9. If you don't believe me, it's playing down at the Pamela Theater. Well, what are you doing tonight? Hey, Ted. Oh, no, no, don't... That's so nice. Thank you. Hey, guys, this is my friend Ted. (3 women approaches) He wants to pay. And you bought all the tickets. I am so sorry that you thought that was a date. Well, then,fair warning: I'm going to say no. No. No. No. No. No. Lower back butterfly tattoo... you're up. This is going to hurt a little. Yeah, but tattoo removal really hurts. Everyone probably sounds like that. Still no. Abby, I've told you before. When they're rude to you, hang up the phone. Go on, you can do this, hang up. Abby, hang it up. I'm sorry, I just wish that some of the patients would be nicer to you. Thanks. Thanks, Abby. Okay, I'm about to break my big rule here. Okay. Abby goes bowling with her church group every Wednesday nights...and she really wanted to invite you, but she's too shy. My receptionist. You really made quite an impression on her with the coffee the other day. I mean, she has really not stopped talking about you. But you just said, ""Abby is...?"" Who's Alan? My receptionist. I am so sorry that I am late. I have, like, two minutes for lunch everyday. What? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, I would never read that piece of crap. Some patient left it here. Oh, Abby, did my hypnotherapist call yet? When am I going to kick this folliculaphilia? Sorry I'm late. Typical two-minute lunch. So we are very close to getting... You know, we should really get this mole checked out. It's just a little irregular. One of my patients has this little butterfly tattoo at the bottom of his back. There you go. Look, even if it is something, it's easily treatable, so try to relax. Oh, that... that's nothing. It's just a little crush. So I will be calling you with your results. Oh, sir, your book! All done. Ted, you're a really nice guy... It has been so great getting to know you. I've had so much fun these last ten weeks. I have a daughter. Her name's Lucy. She's eight. Work and being with her, that's pretty much my life. My social calendar is movie night with the girls once a month when I can get a sitter. I mean, I've been to one party in the past year... St. Paddy's Day... it was awful, I left early. But, really, my only free time is the two minutes I get for lunch, so... this is why I don't date. Ted, I only have time for one most important person in my life, and that's Lucy. Anyway, it's been fun. Next time, think before you ink. But if you ever do wake up with, like, a dolphin tattoo on your ankle, just give me a call. What do you mean? Right. Last two-minute date I had gave me a daughter. Um... Okay. Ted, I seriously only have two minutes... That's like 120 seconds. 380 West 22nd? That's... Stanford. Oh, good. Do you know Adam Lazar? Oh, already cut up. Nice. A little bit. Oh, good. Yeah. 15 seconds. The movie's started. So, what are we seeing? The whole thing? Yeah, I almost walked out, like, five times. We got a little time. Why not? Third grade. Yeah, she's wonderful. I just wish that I could get her to quit smoking, you know? I'm kidding. You know, this neighborhood just keeps on changing. This used to be a cute, little Italian restaurant. Mmm, the cheesecake's amazing. I'm allergic. Me, too, Ted. Huh? I think I can be late just once. (They kiss) Ted... Yes."
735,3,13,ted ,"No, I just thought it would be cool to get a caterpillar tattoo, and then a few weeks went by, and all of a sudden... Well, I think you'll find I have a very high tolerance for pain. Just last night, I sat through the worst movie ever made. No, the worst movie... Manos: Hands of Fate. Uh-huh. I don't believe you, Doctor. Hey. Hey, put that away. Tonight's on me. Come on, I insist. Oh, wow. Oh, yay. Wow, thank you. One, two, three, four. No, it's just, um... I'm just a little embarrassed. I thought this was a date. But it's no big deal. Don't worry about it. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, yeah. Hey, you were right. Worst movie-going experience ever. Of course, it had nothing to do with the movie. No, it's fine. I got to hang out with you on girls' night out. All right, so if you're not allowed to date a patient, I'll just... I'll wait until these ten session are up and then I'll ask you out then. Really? I'm getting mixed signals from you. I feel like you've been staring at my ass for quite some time. What, you're married? Boyfriend? Lesbian? Only date black guys? And yet you can say with absolute confidence that ten weeks from now, if I ask you out on a date, your answer will be... This is far from over. We're talking ten weeks from now. Who knows what she'll want then? Do you know what you're going to want for lunch ten weeks from now? That's ridiculous. So we got off to a rocky start. That may be a problem for some guys, but I get better over time. Right? I'm not some Top 40 song... easily digestible. I'm complex. I require time and multiple listens. I'm 'Stairway to Heaven'. Give me ten sessions, I'm going to turn that ""no"" into a ""yes."" Yeah, well, I can handle pain. This one time I was playing tennis, and... (He screams in a high-pitched ton) Here's to nine more great sessions. Still no. What's up with that? I mean, I juggled. You do magic. How is juggling any lamer than magic? I don't get it. I mean... Anyway... I don't get it. She should be into me by now. I got four sessions left. Ther-There's got to be an angle I'm not seeing. Wait a second. Wait a second, I got the angle. The receptionist. That's my way in. That's not the plan. And how would that help me with Stella? Here's the plan. Hi. Here. I stopped... (He takes the bag back and wait for stella to be able to see him to give it back to Abby) Hi, I stopped for coffee and I... and I thought I'd grab you something. What? And now... we wait. Break it. Abby is...? Oh, Abby. I thought you said ""Alan."" Right. Right, I thought I said ""Alan."" Who's Abby? Exactly. What is happening? You're right, no more gimmicks. One more gimmick. You know what's on her shelf? That self-help book 'The Power of Me'. I know, I know, but I thought if I read it, maybe we'd have something new to talk about. Can I borrow your copy? Hi. Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman. Telepathically? It's crazy. Yeah, I understand. I was just, uh, checking out the old bookshelf here. I see you've read 'The Power of Me'. It's funny... Oh, thank God. (chuckling) I couldn't agree more. That's total crap. I see people reading that on the subway and I just want to shout, ""Get a life, people!"" What? What? No, that's... that's not mine. I've never seen that before in my life. Wha... no, you have me confused with someone else. I'm not gonna nail the receptionist. No. I like Stella. What do you mean? What? What is it? What's the big secret?! Folliculaphilia? What is that? That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. That's not real. I know that you are because there's no such thing. Hi. Uh, Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman. Why? Just why? Uh... okay. You sabotaged my next to last chance with Stella for ten dollars? This is awful. My-my tenth session is next week. I'm gonna ask her out, and she's gonna say the most demoralizing syllable in the English language... no. You know what? Just forget it. I'm not even gonna ask her. Oh, my God, you went and saw her, too. No. She said ""crush""? And she was talking about me? Stella...now that I'm no longer your patient, would you like to have dinner with me? Oh, no. I am gonna k*ll Marshall. Oh, my God, this is worse than the laser. What? There it is... she's a mom. It's just not gonna happen. I'm good. I guess I got no one but myself to blame. She told me right from the start she was gonna say no and sure enough... Wait a minute. You didn't actually say no. All this time you were, uh, you were supposed to say no, but you didn't... I checked the transcript. So, here's what I'm proposing. Uh... You only have two minutes, right? Okay. You want to, uh... go on a a two-minute date with me? Great. And... go. Taxi! I know. 380 West 22nd, please. And step on it. We're in a hurry. Right this way. So, college? Uh-huh. Wesleyan. No. Scott Crable? Thanks. Could we get the check please. We're trying to make a movie in 15 seconds. Okay, great. Uh, how do you want to do this? You had the eggplant parm. I only really had water so... I'm kidding. Oh. Okay. Let's go. Taxi! You nervous? You can't tell at all. 384 West 22nd. Nah, previews. We'll be fine. Ah! Just in time. It hasn't started yet. Manos: Hands of Fate. Only the important parts. Worst movie ever. How we doing on time? Taxi! Okay. Do you want to walk it? So what grade's your daughter in? Ah! That's a good year. What? Oh. Look, coffee and dessert? I know. New York. It's a living organism, an ever-changing tapestry. Ooh, look at the time. Let's go. Flowers? Okay. See? We're getting to know each other. Stella, I had a lovely... Doggy bag? Stella, I had a lovely time. And... date. That wasn't so bad, right? No lengthy, awkward silences. Dessert ran a little long, so... I had to cut the good-night kiss. Look, I would love to have a second date, I would. But I understand that you really don't have time right now, but if you ever do, will you give me a call? Okay. No, no, no, no!"
736,3,13,waitress ,House salad. Eggplant parmesean. Of course.
737,3,13,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, sometimes in life you see someone and you just instantly know this is the person for you. It can happen anywhere. Even the waiting room of a tattoo removal clinic. And that's what happened when I met..Stella. Woman 1, to Ted: Is something wrong? Woman 2, to Woman 1: What's wrong? Woman 1, to Woman 2: Ted's embarrassed-- he thought this was a date. Woman 2, to Woman 3: Ted thought this was a date. Woman 3, to Stella: Stella, did you know Ted thought this was a date? Stella, to Woman 3: What? I'm not allowed to date a patient. It's an AMA rule. Woman 3, to Woman 2: She's not allowed to date patients. It's an AMA rule. Woman 2, to Woman 1: She's not allowed to date patients. It's an AMA rule. Woman 1, to Ted: She's not allowed to date... Ted from 2030: Weeks went by. The second session I told her about how I spent a summer working with inner-city kids. The third session we both spoke nothing but French. The fourth session I made her laugh so hard she fell out of her chair. So by the time the fifth session came around... Abby:...Please... Abby:...how difficult it is for me to... Ted from 2030: And sure enough, by session seven, she saw me in a whole new light. Abby, laughing: That's funny. That's funny, smart, and great. Ted from 2030: That last session was the least painful of all. I savored every searing blast of that laser. Ted from 2030: The moment I'd waited ten weeks for had arrived. Stella, laughing: Thank you, sir. You know, I have always wanted to try this place. Ted from 2030: And that, kids, is how you turn a ""no"" into a ""yes."" Abby:...then he just kept toying with my emotions."

739,3,14,barney ,"Your team lost 20 minutes ago. Something strange is going on. I was down at the hardware store trying to get a little somethin' somethin'. There are four kinds of women who go to the hardware store by themselves. Single, recently single, recently divorced, lesbian who will let me watch. Sorry. Five. Recently widowed. So, I'm talking to this girl... Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder. I was only gone for a second when... See? Skid-proof. The same thing happened at the pet store yesterday. God bless you, Ted. You're reading my blog. I'd call your ex a dog, but that would be an insult to little Ladybug here. Not without a chew toy from Uncle Barney first. And when I got back... I'm sorry,I'm already spoiling her but diamond in the rough... Could your heart just melt? Weird, right? Yeah. The same thing happened last week at the museum. Lily. No. Marshall. Oh. No. Robin. Bingo! So, I was talking to this girl... At this point, about 83%. Soon, these audio guides will be all that I have left. My God, you are beautiful. How about I get you a headset so you can see with your ears like I do? I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds, but when I came back... Hmm.You know, I also love the smell of great art. Why does this keep happening? Oh, really? Then why am I not in prison for perjury? But I don't want to talk about work. Something weird is going on here. Alan Alda. It was Alan Alda. Who was that, um, guy from Mash? The main guy. What...? Hawkeye from Mash. How can I be blanking on this? No. Oh, my God. Where is she? Well, she-she said I hooked up with her? What was her name? What did she look like? Dead in the eyes with an aura of self-loathing and despair? That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God! Some woman that I slept with and screwed over is trying to ruin my life. God, why is this happening to me? Nah, it's not Karma. She's stripping in Vegas. Plus, we're good. My list? Dude, do not pretend you're not the kind of guy who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with. Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list. This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with. I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th. Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you. What do you think, Lil? You recognize the saboteur? All of them, but only about half buy a copy on the way out. Absolutely. And what I do with these women should be between me and them. And you guys. And Heloise. She helped me do the decoupage. This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down? The top 64 women I've slept with, split into four regions. This tournament will systematically narrow down which girl has the most cause to hate my guts. Last girl standing has to be the saboteur. Okay, okay, everybody! Hands. Okay, toss up. ""Thought I was Jorge Posada,"" or ""You have my dead wife's kidney?"" That's true... Down to the sweet 16. And coming out of the Upper West Side, we have the number three seed, ""Girl who thought I owned Google,"" up against the number seven seed, ""Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor."" Yeah, she did. I'm going with Evil Twin. Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl twice. As Barney and Larney. Okay, we're down to the Final Four. What do you think, people? Come on, dig deep. Come on! Marshall? Mosby? Okay. Then this is as far as we get. The Final Four. It's got to be Meg, Anna, Kate or Holly. We are gonna track these girls down, and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar. Okay, there's her building. When she comes out, I'm gonna hide, and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar, we run like hell. What do you mean ""no""? Are you nuts? That would involve me speaking to a woman I've already had s*x with, which, frankly, is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car. Lily, this girl hates me. I hooked up with her in an apartment I was pretending was my own, told her I loved her, and then ditched her there. She got arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail. Oh, crap, there she is! If she sees me, she's gonna k*ll me! If she kills me, I want you to go into my apartment, grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the East River. Look, Meg, we need to talk. And I forgive you. I love you. So you remember who this one is, right? Right, and if you recall, her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I... Ah, there she is. You're really enjoying this, aren't you? Anna, hi. What Web site? You're right, I do deserve that. That's all I came here to say. You know what? I don't care who knows about it. Excuse me. Excuse me. I, Ted Mosby, am a jerk to women. Tell your sisters. Tell your daughters to stay away! Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com. She's... Is it her? You look good. Have you lost weight? We're down to the number one seed. I knew it was Holly. It had to be Holly. Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly. But in my defense, she was kind of annoying. Holly. Well then, to the last Fourth of July weekend I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes. No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is. That's not a bad idea. I'm in. Talking, we should be talking. Words. Here are words. Why is this so hard? Laughter! Hey, there, how are you doing? Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you? It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin. Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you? Uh, I'm going to go to the bathroom now, but, uh, when I come back we'll go to my place and have s*x. I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64. I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize. What? What? So I apologized for nothing?"

You pretend to be a struggling young artist who needs a new muse. Maybe you're not as good a liar as you think you are. You never gonna believe what just happened. Alan Alda? She must have left. She... She didn't say her name, but she had blonde hair, boobs. Kind of trashy. Yes! It's karma. I don't know, Barney. I only saw her face. Oh, Barney, you're never gonna figure out which one of these is the mystery woman. All of these women have a right to hate you. I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot. Absolutely not, Barney. We are not going to make a game out of the women you've tricked into sleeping with you. No way! The girl who thought he had 12 hours to live has way more cause to ruin his life than the girl he faked proposed to. She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play! Fake baby! Is that the blackboard from my classroom? You guys stole my blackboard! No. That woman, like every woman in your Final Four, deserves an apology, and I'm not telling you if she's the one until hear you say, ""I'm sorry."" Barney, you're doing this. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Hey, Meg! Over here! Look who it is! Yo old friend Meg: Barney! Barney? No! What's the matter with you? Get off of him! Look, she's not the one, but you still owe her an apol... Yes. You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect. Yeah, I know, Barney, you showed me. And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present. So go over there and apologize. Ooh and she's holding hot coffee. Maybe she'll throw it in your face. I'm making a scrapbook. Okay, which one is this again? Smile. That is the worst thing you've ever done. That's the worst thing anyone has ever done. She's gonna k*ll you. So you're not mad at Barney? Don't you want an apology? An admission of guilt? Your truck back? We ruined their lives. And the worst part of it is that you didn't apologize to any of those women. Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry. Yes, but it was a great apology. And a perfect way to end my scrapbook. I'm going to call this photo ""Barney's Redemption."" Could you stop giving me the finger?"
744,3,14,man ,"Wow, you are gorgeous. Oh, God, I know that's awful."

You're going blind, and you're trying to soak up all the beauty in the world before the darkness descends. Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up. I mean, any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney and do this or that, or this and that, or do this with those in that... I mean, she should have known what she was getting into. It's fake proposal girl. I mean, she hired a wedding planner! Oh, she only bought him a one-way ticket! Damn it! Jorge Posada! You're kidding me! Barney, you're the tiebreaker. Oh! I can't decide. It could be any one of them. Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up. I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on. I do not. No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is. Okay, here's how it's gonna work. Now, Lily... And then I'll come in, looking hot as all hell. I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move. Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger. Get your hand off my thigh, Barney. You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you? No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom. Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other."

Single girl, mid-twenties, looking for a canine replacement for the boyfriend who just dumped her. Instead, finds Barney. I'm really bored at work.

And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation. Ted from 2030: Eventually, Barney did figure out who the mysterious girl was. But we on that later."
753,3,15,arthur ,"Hey, Marshall.... How's your morning going? Not too bad, not too bad. Hey, is Ferguson in yet? That's great... have a good one, buddy. Hey, Ferguson! I read your report, and it's complete crap! No, you know what? That's an insult to crap. If crap could eat and then crap stuff out, it's that! Your report is the crap that crap craps! If you last two more days here, I'll be shocked! Shocked! Hey, Ferguson. How's your day going? Great, great... Hey, is Marshall in yet? Fantastic. have a good one, buddy. Hello, Marshall. Have you finally finished the ninja report? Please, I have a family. We're so good. What do you want, Marshall? You are nailing this. You got me hooked, reel me in. Stuck the landing... bravo! Thank you. Security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out. Hello, Marshall. Well said, Marshall, I needed to hear that. By the way, I saw your wife's picture in your office. That is one tasty slice. Oh, yeah. That's it. That's where she belongs. Well, thank you, Eriksen, I needed to hear that. No, no, no, the part where you said, ""I quit."" Now we don't have to pay you a severance package. Uh, security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out."
754,3,15,barney ,"Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity! I just called it. I call that I can call things! What, that's it? You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you? I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business. Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car. Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss. Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool. Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good. Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened. Oh, snap. Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website tanked. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley. No, no, of course not... he died. Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming. Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming. It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle. Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now? Oh, God. Hey, marshall. If you go in there with Lily's kindergarten nonsense, you're gonna get torn apart. I'm here to save your life. you hungry? What do you want? A green tea with lemon for me, and for my friend here, the meatloaf, please. Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else. Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive. I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries. Yes, you are. That waiter is every boss and every bully who ever embarrassed or belittled you. And how dare he deny you the one thing that you want, that would make you happy at this moment. A sandwich and gravy fries. Marshall. Hey, what are you guys doing out here? Oh, Ted, relax, it's Cuban. People pay to have their car smell like this. Oh, Marshall, switch seats with me. I called shotgun for all eternity. Well, that's funny, cause I did! A 20% tip, really, for that waiter? I can't believe it! If you're not gonna yell at the waiter, Yell at me. Yell at me. What, you think you're gonna upset me? Please, give me your best shot. Yeah. I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly landing on a leaf about three blocks away. Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content. Make it hurt. No, something that's true-- come on. The man made you cry. Make me cry. Yes. Keep going. Okay, now, well, that's just not cool. No, I'm kidding... keep going. Don't blame this on me, Marshall. I told you to yell at someone beneath you. The circle of screaming is... The chain of scr... Pyramid... the pyramid of screaming! The pyramid of screaming. Ted, screaming never solves anything."
755,3,15,bilson ,"You made yourself look bad, you made this company look bad, and quite frankly, you made our friends, the North Koreans, look bad! And I'll tell you something else, Blauman, if you think for one moment... What?"
756,3,15,blauman ,"You know what, Bilson? You can kiss my ass. You heard me. I don't need to take your crap anymore. My cousin's website went public today, and I made a pile of money on the ipo, so you know what I think Of this whole damn company? Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second till I get started? Come on. Come on."
757,3,15,ferguson ,"Did you hear that? Can you believe he did that On ""Take-your-daughter-to-work"" day? Hey, Arthur. Great. how is yours? Oh, thank god. Yeah, he's right in there."
758,3,15,lily ,"Hey, baby. Are you okay? Oh, baby, I'm so sorry. Oh, baby, it's just not fair. You've been working so hard. Late nights, weekends. I never see you. We've barely made love in weeks. It's bad, guys, mama needs her sugar. God, you're hot right now. And I don't scream at my kids, none of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm. Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten... Hello, Arthur. I have the ninja report right here. But Arthur, in the future, if you want someone to do their best work, try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation, but through encouragement, inspiration and respect. Oh, you're damn right. You know what I'm gonna do when I get home? I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off... It's bad, guys. Mama needs it bad. I'm gonna drive her home like a pack of... I have the ninja report right here, but... Which of these carpets would look better in the new apartment? I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft. It would feel great on your bare feet......or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat rolling down your trembling bosom. Wow, you two are already saying the ""l"" word, huh? You hitting that? No, you're not. Marshall, our future isn't money or an apartment. And it's definitely not you being miserable at that horrible job. I'm just happy to have my husband back. We'll figure the rest out. I love you, too."
759,3,15,man ,"Dude, we're lawyers now. We've got briefcases and everything. You have anything in yours? Candy bars."
760,3,15,marshall ,"Beer. Beer. They always told me that working at a big law firm was like being at war... Totally. Freakin' briefcases. Totally empty. you? Then you get in the trenches side by side with your buddies. And you feel a sense of camaraderie. But before too long... Arthur Hobbes is one of the senior partners at my firm, and he's... he's my boss. He seems like a nice guy, but he's got a nickname... Artillery arthur. It's going fine. How is yours? He is, he's in... just in his office next door. You, too. (Arthur leaves Marshall's office) You never know who's gonna get hit... It was brutal, But the worst was a few minutes later. Yeah, sorry. So that brings us to today. A little background. So I'm working on this report called ""Using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent to contest a class certification order based on a lack of commonality, numerosity..."" Okay. yeah, fine, whatever. Um, so I'm supposed to turn in ""the ninja report"" yesterday. But I got insanely busy with other stuff, I didn't get a chance to finish it, and then this morning... I gotta go. And then... He screamed at me. Barney, I have never been screamed at like that in my life. Yeah, about that... So Arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment... Face turning red, vein in his forehead about to burst, spittle flying like shrapnel. Everyone you work with walking by your office, peering in. And suddenly, I just felt all of it. All of it. The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment, and now I'm working for the bad guys instead. The fact that I am stuck in this job because of a mortgage I can barely afford on an apartment that is crooked. The fact that I am a grown man, and nobody, not even Artillery Arthur, has the right to talk to me like that! I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just... I don't know what happened. There's just something about being yelled at like that, like I was being scolded by my dad. Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy. I felt absolutely powerless. Flaccid... Hell, I... I felt castrated. And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report. How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again? Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big, eloquent speech off the top of your head. Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay? I can't have some big confrontation with Arthur. I need this job, i... I need the money. It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it. He peed on the conference table? That's it? that's the end of the story? How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice? Chain of screaming? I don't scream at Lily. Lily, I need your take on this. What... what should I do? You're right, baby, it's about respect. That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight. Can you give me that speech again? Shh, don't say my name. Lily can't know it's me. Just pretend you're talking to Stella. Be all lovey dovey. Not good, not good at all. Right downstairs, come find me. Without Lily. I love you. I'm in trouble, Ted. Ted, I'm freakin' out, man. I did something stupid, can we just drive somewhere? I need to get away... just drive, man. Please just drive. Dude! Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech that Lily told me to give, be firm but respectful? Well, it didn't totally go that way. After we all finished talking last night, I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report. How long have you been sitting there? Yeah, I was just about to order. A sandwich and gravy fries. No, I didn't want meatloaf. No, I don't. Who would I even scream at? No. Oh, I was just telling Ted a story. Okay, so... Then I say to Barney... I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney. Excuse me? This is not what I ordered. I beg your pardon, sir, But I ordered a sandwich and gravy fries, And as the customer, I'm always right, so... Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here! I don't know, Barney, he worked a triple, it just... What? I'm not gonna yell at you, Barney. Okay, fine... what, you want me to yell at you? This is me yelling at you, Barney. This is me yelling at you, Barney! You don't look as good in suits as you think you do! Your mom's a slut! Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, Barney, but you and your brother clearly have different fathers, And you know why? It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut! I don't care what you say. Bob Barker is not your father! Oh my god, Barney, I'm so sorry... Bob Barker's not your father! You've concocted this delusional idea that a game show host is your real father, and he's not! You were abandoned, Barney! You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it, and so now you never allow yourself to feel anything, and that's how you survive in this corporate world, and if I keep heading down this path, I'm gonna turn into you! And I don't want that! I don't want any of this! This is not why I became a lawyer. This is not the person that I wanted to be... Really, 'cause I didn't mean to attack you personally, It's just that i... Dude! How am I supposed to tell lily? She supported me through three years of law school, and now is the time when I'm supposed to pay her back. Now we're gonna lose the apartment. The place where we were gonna raise our children. How am I supposed to tell the person who I love more than anything in this world that I've just thrown away our future? I'm so sorry. I just lost it. But I can fix it. First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go in there on my hands and knees and beg for my job back. What? I love you. You sure about this? Ted, I don't think I can accept... Thanks a lot, buddy. Oh, yeah!"
761,3,15,robin ,"You can't call shotgun for eternity. You can't just call things, barney. Look, Marshall, he screamed at you, you took it. He probably respects you more for it. Is ""boy"" the right word? Here's what I would do if I were you. Hi, Arthur. Yeah, I got it. Right here. I think it's gonna blow you away. So we good? Then why are you still in my office? So it's not a circle. Hey, I was just heading to the bar. What are you guys doing out here? Ooh, I like stories. You want a lick? What? Uh, it's delicious enough. Oh sweet, can I get a toot?"
762,3,15,ted ,"A new car! Okay, what happened? Dude, you lost us. Can't you just call it something cool like ""the ninja report""? Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work? All of what? Okay, g*n violence might be the answer to everything up in Canada, Robin, but here in America, we solve our problems with words. Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy with a big eloquent speech defending human dignity. Like abraham Lincoln. Observe. Arthur? Justice, sir. You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights, the most fundamentally paramount of which is the right... Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount. One means highest, one means lowest. Human beings have rights, and those rights are, um... There are certain justices that cannot or will not be inalienable... as such... for the future. Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow, tell him off and then quit? Oh, my God. I thought it was a chain of screaming. Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles? Hey, Stella. Sweetie, how's it going? Where are you right now? Okay, I'll see you soon. I love you, too. Apparently. Um... it's a new car, so just be careful... It's just, this is a really good parking spot. Look, just tell me what happened first. There is a lot of ketchup on that burger. Sorry, what happened? Is that ice cream cone big enough? Uh-uh. against car rules, it's against car rules! Well, that's just not true. Robin, you dropped a little ice cream... I'm sorry. Everybody out, everybody out of the new car! Out of the new car! Yeah, who needs a car in new york city, right? Marshall, don't make me scream at you. You guys did it in the car, didn't..."
763,3,15,waiter ,"Okay, friends, what do you like? Very good. One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf. Enjoy, my friends. Yes? Yes, it is. No, no, I am not going to stand here and take this! I am at the end of a triple shift... that's 18 hours!... And then I have to take two trains and a bus to astoria to have my wife scream at me because I'm never home. No, no, you eat your damn meatloaf!"
764,3,15,,"Ted from 2030: Kids,the spring of 2008 was a pretty great time for me. Stella and I had started dating, and I'd just gotten a big raise at work. So I decided to purchase something I knew would be the envy of all my friends. Marshall:...You get out of law school, it's like getting out of boot camp. That first day at work, you're storming the beaches, full of piss and vinegar... Marshall:...the shells start to fall. Hello, Arthur. Barney, pouring some water in a glass: Does this help? Lily:...When dealing with a bully, the most important thing is to be constructive and positive. Lily:...just throw her on the bed... Lily:...and drive her home like a pack of sled dogs! Marshall:No, the other part, please. Ted from 2030: And it seemed like that was the end of it, but it wasn't, because the next night... Robin:You can't call shotgun for eternity. Robin:It's case by case. Marshall:... I quit, Arthur! I quit! Ted from 2030: And so marshall finally had to tell lily what happened. Ted from 2030: Ultimately, they were able to make ends meet without going bust on the apartment."
765,3,16,barney ,"Ooh! Somebody you went to Degrassi with? Tell me more. Tell me more. Like, did he have a car? Sounds to me like he gave you your first ""O, Canada!"" face. Did you ride his Zamboni? Wha...? I thought you said you were together all summer. You're starting out with two big ones right there. I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are nattering on about our big celebrity. What do you do for a living? Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight. So, Simon, how did you guys meet? I'm sorry. I've seen ""Let's Go to the Mall"" about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it. There's another video?! Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape. All right! You leave me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute ching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found. Michelle? She sounds hot. No. What about Lily and Michelle? What... (stammers) Do they make out? Finish him! I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle. All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter? Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago. Ooh. Really? (Robin starts crying)Oh! Oh, come here. Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome. No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be. Your place? Are you sure you want to do this? Of course. So, should I just put it in? Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more. Is that Alan Thicke? You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then? Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad."
766,3,16,lily ,"Totally. What's the occasion? Wait, wait. Did he break up with you and tell you he's just not that Inuit? Louise Marsh?! That's a whore's name if I ever heard one. Oh! I know why. You're gonna win, aren't you? Point Robin. So, Simon, Robin's a bit of a local celebrity here in New York. She's the lead anchor at Metro News One. Tell him, Robin. Well, that's cool. You got to pay the bills somehow since your whole music thing didn't really pan out, did it? What? Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out. What happened? He asked you out?! Oh, step into my web, Simon. Robin, this guy doesn't deserve a second chance. Not after the way he treated you. Oh, hell, no! That my girl Michelle? How she livin'? Oh, girl, you gots to get your drink on up in here. For reals. What's revertigo? Oh. One example of that springs to mind. I think we all know what it is. Yeah. Ted. Whenever Ted's friend Punchy comes into town, it's like, all of a sudden, Ted's in high school again. Why? Oh, we know you do, honey, but we're worried about you. I don't know. Is there any version where you don't sound like a 16-year-old? No. If I was your mom, I woulsay, ""We forbid you from seeing this boy."" No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good. You've been drinking, haven't you? You're not going to that show tonight! Young lady, get back here! Thanks for your help. Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real. Simon's a dawg. You feel me, Chelle? Mm. True dat. I'ma get me my champagne and grape soda on."
767,3,16,marshall ,"So he's the guy who... How shall I say this like a gentleman? Robin, did he take your maple leaf? Wait, wait, wait. Did he...? I think I'm out. Yeah, why would he want to get back together with Louise Marsh? And now he's coming here? Robin, why do you want to see this guy? Point Simon. Ah. Point Robin. That's five-zip. There's no coming back from that. The thing is, we gave you so many opportunities. It's just... It was so hard to watch, Robin. You're usually so cool. It's called ""revertigo."" You know who gets really bad revertigo? (whispers) Lily when she around her high school friend, Michelle. Oh, my friend, you are in for a treat. Hey, Lil? You know, I was just thinking, we haven't seen your friend Michelle in a while. Better. Comparable. I think you're gonna enjoy this. Robin, your revertigo is really starting to affect your work. No. It's a phenomenon where, when you're around people from your past, you start behaving like them. You do? Robin, the point is, what are you doing? I mean, this guy? Now, now. We were once young and in love, too. Not now, Ted! Revertigo?"
768,3,16,michelle ,"Bitch, you know it! She living only way she know how to. Large! I'm hoping my big ass can hustle me up a vodka-Gatorade. Mm-hmm, for reals. He a scrub. Great! I'm almost done with my dissertation. Hmm. I'm getting a PhD in behavioral psychology. Oh. I know. Whenever I'm around Lily, she just brings out that side of me. There's a psychological term for the phenomenon."
769,3,16,punchy ,"'Sup, Shmosby?! I'm already there!"
770,3,16,robin ,"Coming up next, 'Is your baby trying to k*ll you?' I know, right, isn't that amazing? I spent half an hour making these happen. Its tape in there, cotton balls, half of a Nerf football, but it works, right? And old friend from Canada is in town and I'm meeting him for a drink. No. Actually, he was my first boyfriend. Simon. I thought he was the coolest guy ever. He smelled like Drakkar. He could ollie on a skateboard. He had the most amazing collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. We spent the whole summer madly in love. No, it wasn't like that. Well, I'm sorry, guys. It was all very tame. We only dated for a week and a half. Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty much the last week of July. Anyway, one night, his band just finish playing this gig... Oh, my God! Simon. That was such a good show. You guys totally rocked out. What? Oh... So... I totally... I get it. Pools are great. Swimming's awesome. We have a sprinkler. Run right through it. Well, I should go. Yeah, Simon? I did. I have no idea what you' talking about. Well, since you brought it up, let's add up the points. Thank you. Okay. So, Simon still lives with his mom. Um, he never became a rock star. He now works at a water slide park outside of Ottawa. No. Yeah, he's going down. I mean, unless somehow, he got hotter. There he is. Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it? Hey, Simon. Yeah. You look great. You got hotter, like that's possible. So... Look, I know it didn't go as planned, but I can't help it. I mean... he's still got it. So he's not a snob. He's from a different part of Canada, you know? The maple leaf flag on the back of the pickup truck? He's Red Province. He's from the Deep North. No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt. The Foreskins are still playing? I know. I'm sorry. I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream. Starred in it is more like it. No. Okay. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm sitting next to Simon, and suddenly I'm 16 again. Whatever. It's over. I lost. I guess you, uh, you don't get second chance. I got a second chance. He came by my place tonight... Simon. What are you doing here? Oh, I like where this is going. I'd love to! That was ten years ago. People evolve. I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school? Yeah! That rocked. Oh, uh, sure. Oh, cool. I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning. Oh, well, you know, it's not a show. It's the news. And now it's time for ""Puppy Corner,"" some little angels looking for a new home, courtesy of the Midtown Animal Shelter. Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted. Of course, a lot of the people calling in thought we were going to k*ll them. Okay, you want the truth? Yeah. I like Simon. I do. We have fun together. You're worried? Okay, hold on. Is there any version of this conversation where you guys don't sound like my parents? That's exactly what my mom would say. Lily! This is my life! You guys just don't get it! You've never felt the way that I feel! Yeah, like, a billion years ago. Yeah, we all have. You bought the last round. Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else? Tonight, after the show, Simon and I are going all the way. Oh, hey, Simon. Great show. You guys still rock. God, I just love seeing you so happy. What? I'm fine, really. Um, can I make an observation? Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show. No, tonight. It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again. Right. Of course, the-the first being you. Barney, do you want to come back to my place? Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay? Yeah, why not? This was my big artistic follow-up to""Let's Go to the Mall."" It kind of tanked. Oh, I'm so glad. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I was lame. He was my sidekick. He had to be."
771,3,16,simon ,"Yeah. I know. I figure we're about four or five gigs away from really exploding. We're gonna be big, babe. I mean, like Crash-Test-Dummies big. So, that everything? All right. Listen, babe... It's over. I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh. Well, the thing is... her folks just put in a pool. Uh... Babe, wait. You forgot to load the drum set. Hey, babe. Wow, look at you. You got old. Whoa! Four bucks for a brew? What a rip. Good thing I'm packing. Oh, I work at the Splish Splash Ottawa Water Slide Park. Yeah, it is... because I save lives. If I'm not sitting in that stool at the top of the slide, going... Go.. Go... Go... people die. What, you think it's so easy? You try it. You didn't put your hand up; kid just died. Another kid just went; he died too. Another kid just went; now you've got a pile-up and Robin's got something to report on the news. This just in: My friend, Ted, just k*lled a bunch of kids today. Well, it hasn't panned out yet, but the band's still going. About four or five gigs away from really exploding. Well, there's four of us, and we play without shirts. Babe, seriously. Oh, I was in her video. Well, once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg, everybody wants a piece of the moneymaker. No, I was in the other one. I just feel like there's some unfinished business between you and me. Seeing you now... has made me realize that breaking up with you is the biggest mistake I made in my entire life. I know this is crazy, and I'm only in town for a couple of days, but do you want to go on a date? Guys, that was great. Let's take five. Hey, babe, did you like it after my bass solo when I flicked my pick at you? Yeah. Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need that pick back. Um, I think it... It's cool. You'll find it later. Oh, but, babe, you got to go to work. You got to play our demo on your show. Right. So you can be, like ""Hey, did you hear there's some news? There's a rad band you guys should check out."" And then play it. Or just, like, the first three songs. Yeah. They totally dug my bass solo. Man! Why can't I always feel this alive?! Yeah. About that. Listen, babe. It's over. I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh."
772,3,16,ted ,"So, I got up this morning, its freezing. So I walked over there. And I don't know why I am still talking. Because clearly we are all asking the same question. What in God's creation is going on with Robin's breasts. Um, something about fur trapping. Yeah, I'm also ""oot. Okay, now I'm really out. No! Tell me you did not load the drum set. Yes, you do. Whenever you haven't seen someone for a long time, no matter how much you want to deny it, there's always a clear winner and a clear loser. Point Robin. Wait. Do they have a wave pool? Okay, what the hell just happened? Huh! A water slide park. That sure is different than what Robin does. Um... (clears his throat)... okay. Go. No, I didn't know... Oh, well, sure. I mean, if I was actually... The Foreskins? How'd you guys come up with that name? Oh, it's actually a common thing. When you're around someone from your past, you kind of revert back to who you were when you knew them. There's not really a name for it, though. Yeah, I don't know about ""revertigo."" You don't know about Lily and Michelle? Comparable. The coup de grace. Wait. You're going on a date with Simon? That Simon?The one we met? It's a stupid, made-up word with no meaning. Me? Okay, okay. First of all, his name is Adam Punciarello, and I don't do that. Ooh. That must be Adam. 'Sup, Punchy? You want to go? Dude, seriously, I'm sorry about your dad. I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this. No reason. Hey, so, today at work... Geez. Well... I'm sorry, Robin. So, how's Columbia?"
773,3,16,,"Ted from 2030: Now kids, When aunt Robin was the teenager. She was, well, the Canadian pop star. But by 2008, she was the entirely different person. Ted from 2030: Which maybe events that week, all the more surprising. Ted from 2030: This went on for a really long time. Some of them jokes were elegant and well-crafted... Ted from 2030:...others were crude, and ill-formed... Ted from 2030:...and others were obvious, but needed to be said... Ted from 2030: And sure enough, there was a clear winner, and a clear loser. It just wasn't clear to everybody. Robin, giggling: Oh, my God. Punchy:Yeah, it was a real shock. Robin, laughing: What? You're kidding me. You're breaking up with me? Again? F-For the same ex-girlfriend? In the same van? What is it? Her-Her parents got a pool? Is that still the reason? Michelle:No. Actually, it's associative regression. You see, the neural pathways that... Oh, no, you did not just put on my jam! Oh. Put your hands up, girl! Ted from 2030: One by one, we all had to go home. Soon, it was just Robin. Ted from 2030: And so they watched it again... And again... And again. They watched it over and over that night until finally... (Robin and Barney kiss) they stopped watching."
774,3,17,barney ,"In my experience, the way this normally goes is, we lie here for a while, make a little awkward chitchat. Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery, rocket test flight I've got to be at, slip out of the apartment and never call you again. Actually, you usually say that out loud. So...I just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend Best friend. Okay. Wait. Right click, save as... Into the.bpeg folder, and okay. This never happened. It's a good plan. Okay. Right. So, Robin? Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night? Okay. This never happened. Never happened. Never... happened. What? I... I... I'm... I'm... What are you talking about?! Ha-ha right. A great friend, by the way. The best. Is it my imagination, or are these drinks getting smaller? If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, ""try again."" How you doing there, Robin? Ted, she has a name! And just what are you accusing me of? I'll come with you. God, this is awkward. Being around Ted. Because of our thing. You're really gonna pretend this never happened? Stella! You have a serious girlfriend now! You're over this one. Robin who, right? Stella makes this one look like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right? Happy birthday, bro. Hey, Marshall, I need your help. I know. I want to hire you. I need a lawyer. I'll pay you. A little. Forget that. That's a Tuesday for me. New shredder. This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds. From sky mall. It's all from sky mall. Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall. Want a hot dog? Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret that you can't tell anyone-- not Ted, not Robin, not Lily. You are hearing this secret, Marshall. I... I slept... (Marshall covers his ears with his hands and starts singing) Stop..stop doing that. (Barney throws a bowling ball at him, Marshall catches it) I slept... I slept with Robin. Are you mad at me? How's the hot dog? You can't. you can't tell anyone. Attorney-client privilege. Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer, to prove that I didn't do anying wrong. I didn't break any state or federal laws, but I think I broke a much, much higher law. The Bro Code. Bro Code article one:""Bros before hoes."" Bro Code article 89: ""The mom of a bro is always off limits, but the stepmom of a bro is fair game if she initiates it, and/or is wearing at least one a article of leopard print clothing."" Bro Code article 34: ""Bros cannot make eye contact during a devil's three-way."" Two dudes. You think I wrote that? Oh, Marshall, don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code? The year was 1776. The place: Philadelphia. Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were hangng a drink. I shall write this set of rules. And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution. To save paper. And I shall l include a provision that stateth ""No eye contact in a devil's three-way."" I've just been losing my mind lately, and do you know why I feel so bad? No, that was awesome. I feel bad because the Bro Code clearly states ""No s*x with your bro's ex."" But if you, my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere, then that bad feeling will go bye-bye. No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork. Technically, you'll be paid by a toy factory in Pyongyang. Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation, I'd hire the guy we pay to hint notize us before depositions. Now, get cracking! Fantastic, you're here. Give me the good news. No! Bad lawyer! I need a loophole! I want to feel better, Marshall! I can't keep buying things! I have six self-cleaning litterboxes and I don't even have a kid. Wait. How about this? Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right? And if he's broken the Bro Code, then I'm off the hook. What?! Hey. Good. Yeah. I wish we had some wine, too. Damn it, Marshall. I'm not paying you to tell me what a saint Ted is! You're my lawyer! The answer is in there! Find it! What if he never wants to talk to me again? Goat in a party hat? Vegas. Surprise! Just a decoy, my friend. Oh, no. There is. We're just not going. This is how good a friend I am. They want you to spent your 30th standing around drinking flat beer ten feet above your living room. But not me, bro. I pulled out all the stops. Private jet, Valderrama suite at the Bellagio. Steaks at BOA, scotch at Ghostbar, then two ringside seats to watch Floyd Mayatather go ten rounds with, wait for it... a grizzly bear! No! We have to go to Vegas. Look, Ted, I didn't want to say this, but... there's something that I have to tell you, and I wanted you to be in the best possible frame of mind before you heard it. When did you find out? So you're not mad? I'm so relieved to hear you say that. You think I'm proud of this?! I'm horrified that this happened. You mean... what position? (They starts fighting) Stop it! Stop it! Ted! Stop! Stop! Okay. Okay. You're pissed. You deserve to be. Fine. You know what? One free shot. On me. Anywhere but the face. (Ted hits him where it hurts the most...) Who punches someone in the groin? Okay.Okay. I deserved that. I deserved that. But what's important now is... we're passed this whole Robin thing now, right? Yeah. And I broke it. I'm sorry. But, Ted...seriously, this suite at the Bellagio... What does that mean? Are you saying you don't want to be bros anymore? Okay, I'm going to stop you right there, because it seems like you're about to say something that's going to pretty much ruin Vegas."
775,3,17,benjamin ,"But, bro, seriously, I called the dibs on that wench. You codpiece blocked me. Well, there should be. There should be a set of rules that govern the way bros comport themselves among other bros. And I have to do some kite-flying or setething. Seconded."
776,3,17,everyone ,Surprise!
777,3,17,frank ,"You got it, toots. Oh! Ah, isn't that sweet! Well, you know, honey, right after this, I'm gonna drop old Missy off at the butcher shop. And they're going to take a great big knife..."
778,3,17,george ,"So what if I did? There's no rule against it. But who shall write such a document? I have to go to Me, D.C.,and pose for the dollar bill. It's resolved! Barney Stinson shall write... the Bro Code. Seconded."
779,3,17,girl ,"Will we ever go to see Missy the Goat again? Ms. Aldrin, please don't let emem eat Missy."
780,3,17,lily ,"It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there. I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there. And with a little luck, in a few days, Farmer Frank's cold will be all gone. And that's why Farmer Frank's breath smells like medicine. Right, Farmer Frank? Any last questions for Farmer Frank? Yes. I know, I know. I already called an animal rescue, and they're going to come get her on Monday. I-I guess I'll keep her up on the roof. Hey, where are you? Great. Well, everyone's here. Stella just arrived and there is something here so awesome, I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you won't believe... Damn it! Well, you still gotta see it. It's so much fun having a goat at a party! Okay. Bye. Okay, everyone, Ted's in the limo, five-minute warning! Everyone get ready! Oh, Missy, are you excit?? Yes, you are! Marshall, can we keep the goat? But she's so cute and furry and soft. Why don't we just call Duluth Mental Hospital and say my Uncle Linus can live with us? Oh, you should talk.You slept with Barney. I can't believe you did that. That's so gross. Was it amazing? I know but it's Barney. It's just hard not to be curious. Did he have like devices and stuff? Hot wax? Did he tie you to anything? I'm sorry. Is he all smooth down there?"
781,3,17,marshall ,"Although, I'm gonna be hitting it pretty soon. Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts. Hello. Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now. For the last time, Barney, I will not be your butler. How much? I'll take it. Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say, this might be a little bit over my head. For one thing, I'm fairly certain that if these contracts aren't executed precisely, we will be at war with Portugal. Of course. Why are you upset? No. no, no, no, I don't want any more secrets, especially now that I know what you guys did to the drinking water in lisbon. I... You slept with Robin? I don't know. It's helping. You slept with Robin?! I... I cannot keep that secret. I mean, you know I at least have to tell Lily. Why are you doing this to me?! How can I help you as your lawyer? You didn't break any laws, did you? Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she? This is not a legal docume.. This is just something you wrote. Listen, what do you want me for? Yeah, because you slept with Robin. And you would pay me for that? Barney, I'm no shrink, okay, but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted? Attorney-client privilege.I can't talk about it. Nothing. How was your day? Oh, goat turd on the floor,I see. Is that new? I don't know what you're talking about,madam. I'm sorry. You did too good of a job writing this thing. It's-it's iron-clad. I thought about that. And I gotta say, Ted has upheld this thing time and time again. For example, article 87: ""A bro shall at all times say yes."" Article 29 ""A bro will in a timely manner alert his bro to the existence of a girl fight."" Article 53: ""A bro will, whenever possible, provide his bro with protection."" Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it. The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong. And the only way you're ever gonna feel any better about it is if you tell Ted what you did. Well, I guess that's just a chance you're gonna have to take. Oh, crap! Where are they?! I'm getting a cramp. No. Yeah, and she also sheds, eats out of the garbage and can't control her bobowels. I'm sorry! I couldn't take it anymore. Stop it. That's enough. What's wrong with you?"
782,3,17,ranjit ,You slept with Robin? Barney! That is Ted's ex-girlfriend! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!
783,3,17,robin ,"Check. And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, ""who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?"" And I just slept with my ex-boyfriend's really good friend. Okay, here's the deal, Barney. The second my feet touch the ground, this never happened. Now we go back to exactly the way things were before. Yes, Barney? I'm gonna shower... till June, and, um, since you were never here to begin with, you won't be here when I get out. Yeah, you are. I'm good. I'm gonna get a drink. Okay. What is? Why? What thing? Nothing. Hey, Ted. You ready to, um... Where'd the goat turd come from? Well, it was either that, or a musk ox turd, and I figured,what the hell would a musk ox be doing in here? Barney told you. Marshall, you can't look me in the eye, you're blushing, coughing, and your hands are shaking. Ted is never finding out about this, you understand? Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything. And don't even think about opening that can until I'm out of the splash zone. What's up? From my vacacation in Vermont. I slept with Barney! It was just one time, it, it was the night that Simon dumped me and I was in a really vulnerable place and I, I wanted to just pretend like it never happened, but I couldn't, and... I can't. I just, I had to tell you. And... I just hope that we can still be friends. So you're not mad? Yeah, Lily, that may seem like a good idea after a couple of drinks but tomorrow morning you're going to want this thing out of your house. Marshall! What? I... Lily, I really don't want to talk about this. Lily,come on."
784,3,17,ted ,"So, tell us, what was it like? Penetrating that barrier. You and I are the first ones to hit it. Well, not the first ones, certainly, but the first ones at this table. The big three-oh. You know, my 30th birthday's this friday. Did you forget? What kind of friend is this guy? Oh, so, I made a a decision. I'm going to go through all my old stuff, And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore. Hmm. Barney, you want my xbox? Liking video games? What never happened? What are you guys talking about? Guys, cut the act. I know. I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me. Marshall let it slip earlier today. Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything. Just be sure to invite Stella. Monday?! Where's she going to sleep and eat and go to the bathroom?! Okay, where's she going to sleep and eat? Look, call me crazy. I just... I don't think having a goat in the apartment is a good idea. How'd you know that was a goat turd? Hey. Guess what your wife brought home. Talk about what? How does everyone know that's a goat turd? Robin, come here! Yes. Yes. Da. Dude, two girls are fighting at MacLaren's. Yeah, yeah. It was crazy. This one girl was like... Oh, hey. Whoa, you guys went all out. Whoa, we're leaving the city. Where the hell is this party? Vegas? I thought the party was on the rooftop. So there's no roof party? Take me home, Barney. You slept with Robin. Hey, Robin. Come here! I was, uh, just going through some old stuff and I... Anyway, uh, I came across this. Yeah. I don't know if you'd even want it, but if you do, it's yours. What? Of course we can still be friends. Well, I'm... it's a little weird, but, um... No, I'm not mad. No, I'm not mad. I mean, Robin and I broke up a year ago. We've, we've both dated lots of people since then. I'm with Stella now. Seriously, I...I'm fine with this. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hey, I just remembered, um, my mom is coming into town next month. Maybe you'd like to nail her, too! Three billion women on the planet! Three billion! And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?! Robin?! How did it happen? Huh? Barney, I want to know. Tell me exactly how it happened. You think that this is just about Robin? This is about... You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff. I mean some really terrible stuff to a lot of different people. I just always thought there had to be a limit. I always thought I was the limit. You're always spouting off these rules for bros. Isn't one of them, ""don't do this""? I am not going to Vegas with you! I'm not going to blow off my friends and my girlfriend, and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club. The fact that you think I would... You know, Barney,earlier this week I started putting things in a box and that box was labeled ""stuff I have no use for anymore."" It means... maybe you belong in that box. I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore. Ranjit, stop the car. I'm getting a cab."
785,3,17,woman ,So he saved you from an avalanche? And he carried you six miles to safety on his broken leg? And you're a pre-op transsexual nightclub singer who used to be a member of the Russian mob? That feels nice. I just wish we had some wine.
786,3,17,,"Ted from 2030: Well, kids, here we are. We've arrived, my 30th birthday. The long-awaited story of...the goat. That week started just like any other. Barney woke up in some girl's bed. Ted from 2030: But pretending it never happened wouldn't be that easy. Ted from 2030: For many years, we had heard Barney quote the Bro Code, a list of do's and don'ts for all bros. Some were basic. Ted from 2030: Some were unbelievably complicated. Ted from 2030: And some were just plain disturbing. Ted from 2030: While Marshall examined the Bro Code, Lily's kindergarten class welcomed a special guest. Ted from 2030: And Frank went on to traumatize Lily's entire class with a graphic explanation of where meat comes from... So not one little scrap of Missy goes to waste. Ted from 2030: And, boy, was I right,because what Missy the Goat would go on to do in that bathroom was so... No, you know what? I'm m getting ahead of myself. We'll get there. Ted from 2030: Which brings us to April 25, 2008. My 30th birthday, or as it would come to be referred to in later years: The Day of the Goat. Barney:I'm in the limo, right outside of Ted's office. Ted from 2030: In a few short hours, Lily would come to regret those words. But we'll get there. Barney:Uh, gotta go. Here he comes. Ted from 2030: Oh, right, the goat. So funny.You're going to love this. So later in that night, the goat locked himself in the bathroom and was eating one of Robin's washcloths and wait, hold on. Robin wasn't living here on my 30th birthday. When did this happen? Oh, wait, the goat was there on my 31st birthday. Sorry, I totally got that wrong."
787,3,18,all ,Five years!!??
788,3,18,barney ,"Are you saying you don't wanna be bros anymore? I'm sorry, I gotta let you go. It's just too many good wingmen out there. Ted are you crying? Sh! Let it out, let it out. No offence Randy, but there is a long list of candidats for this slot. This slot is for vice president of awesome. And you are like assistant under secretary of only ok.  Pitt, Barney Stinson! Yeah. Yeah. So, listen you should meet me in McLaren's tonight. So what do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock? (They both hang up) Starry Porten, Barney Stinson. I need a new bro, what do you say? Oh, I understand. Duck Stan is a good bro. I'm happy for you. Best of luck. (He hangs up) Crazy Willie! Barney Stinson. Yes finally! Hanging up on you once wasn't enough. (And then Barney hangs up) Hey, Randy. Could you come here for a minute? (Randy releases a box. And comes in Barney's office by running) Good news. I'm calling you up to the majors. Starting tomorrow night, how would you like to be my new wingman? Hey. No, uh-uh. Randy, we never use the word ""bro"" in the name of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate. You know what? I'm excited about this, Randy. You will be my next masterpiece. It's like with Ted. When I first met him, he was an even bigger loser than you. But tonight, I'm going to make you the greatest wingman in the history of wingmen. Oh, okay, Randy, let's do this. (Barney wants to pick up two young woman) You ready? What? What's the matter? Randy what are you doing? (Finally Randy is ready, so Barney goes talking to the girls) Hey, laddies. Have you met... (He points the finger towards Randy and turns around. But Randy hid under a table.) 13 years??!!"
789,3,18,lily ,"So are you two back together? Yeah! She had just as much s*x with Barney as Barney had with her. I will tell you why he is not mad. Because he is so happy with Stella. You guys haven't had s*x yet!!?? When Marshall and I were two months, we were doing it 24/7. So what you guys waiting for? Oh baby, do you remember Martin Luther King day? Five years! God, if I even went one year, I would be out on the street selling it for a nickel. So what does this mean for you? Is she ever wanna want to get intimate? You know what? It's not. This woman needs it bad. Anything you do is going to be fireworks. I remember my longest drought... (V.O.) It was that summer I lived in San Francisco. I hadn't had been with Marshall since two months and 19 days. (There is a shock. And Lily likes the sensation which that gets her.) Oh, San Francisco! Hey. Yeah. We heard. I would explode if it had been that long since I had a ""night out"". Nothing. Pizza. What are you talking about?"
790,3,18,marshall ,"I miss Barney. I haven't ""high five"" with anyone like a week. I think I might be starting to lose my fist bone careless. Wait, so you haven't had s*x since like Thanksgiving. Do you know how many big federal holidays have come and gone since then. Yeah, I do. We ode that dude big time. Wow. Stella hasn't had s*x since 2003. Let's just put this in context. The last time Stella had s*x, the movie, Seabiscuit, had just galloped into the theaters... and our hearts. The last time Stella had s*x, the world was just learning about SARS. The last time Stella had s*x, The Da Vinci Code had just come out. Not the movie, the book. Notable deaths in 2003... Oh my God... Nell Carter. Did you guys know that Nell Carter had died? Dude, relax, it's all about expectations management. Do you know why I hated Jerry Maguire so much? No, because you built it up for, like, two weeks, saying it was the greatest movie ever. With Stella, do the opposite: lower expectations. Hey, buddy. I'm married, Barney, I cannot be your new wingman. (Marshall hangs up, then Robin's phone rings, she picks up the phone and say directly...) Hey. So, uh, looking forward to tonight? This one wakes me up at 4am sometimes just to have a little night out. You haven't had s*x in five years??!! That is a shocking revelation that we're just finding out right now!"
791,3,18,narrator ,"Now kids, the spring of 2008 was a complicated time in your old man's life. (Cut to when Ted and Barney was in the limo) The last time I had seen Barney was shortly after I found out he has spent the night with Robin. She was right. (We see videos of Stella and Ted) Stella and I had been dating for two months. And things were going really well. (Stella, Ted and his friends are playing) She had mat my friend in past for flying colors. There was just one little problem. So uncle Barney began to search for a new wingman."
792,3,18,pitt ,"Hey! I haven't been calling you, it has been a while. You never gonna believe this. I'm at the hospital. Just had a baby daughter."
793,3,18,randy ,"Hey Barney, new sky mall come in. So worldaround blog's fear is you are looking for a new wingman. I wanna let you know, I'm available. Just the say the word, or don't even say the word. Just do something with you eyebrow. Was that it? Assistant under secretary of only ok. Thank you, I will not let you down. Uh... Just need to check my calendar. Be right back. (Then he goes in the lane, and dances. He comes back.) Tomorrow works. What up bro-seph Lieberman?  Goodbye ""Geraldine Ferrar-bro"". What a loser. Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro. Yeah. I've been reading your blog for years. You are like a God to me. That's why tonight is going to be legendary... wait for it... dary. Ok. Yes. (Barney starts walking and Randy holds Barney by the arm) No, no, no, no, no, no! Nothing, let's do this. (Barney starts walking and Randy holds Barney by the arm) No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please! Just wait, just wait, just wait, just wait! Dripping with game, that's what i'm doing. Okay let's go. No. Yes. No! Randy listen to me: you can do this okay? Ok. I don't know. Are thos girls really that hot? Yes, they're hot. Let's do this. Okay! I peaked really young."
794,3,18,robin ,"Let me ask you something Ted. Why are you so much madder at Barney than me? You know what? I'm not sure that's true. I think I actually prefered if you are mad at me. This is too weird. Well, Ted, what else did she said? Did she gave you any kind of explanation? Well that's doesn't seem like that long ago. Wow. Yeah, it'll be pretty hard now that she's dead. No. (And hangs up)"
795,3,18,starry ,"What up, chef? Dude, I'do love to but now I'm bro with Duck Stan."
796,3,18,stella ,"So I lanced this thing on this guy's back, and I'll be honest with you, I didn't even know what it was, and then it exploded like a volcano. Plus everywhere. Oh, there is no lock on that door. Yeah, but then it's just gonna be weird between me and the door tomorrow. You've been so patient Ted. The truth is... I'm kind of nervous. I have a confession to make. No, um... it's kind of embarrassing, but it's been a while since I was intimate with anyone. Really? How long it's been for you? Tell me. Me too! Look, after Lucy was born, I dated a little, but it was hard to find a guy I could trust enough. Sooner or later, every one of them gave me a reason not to. Look, Ted, guys regret the girls they didn't sleep with. Girls regret the guys they do sleep with. And for the past five years, I've had no regrets. Ted, you're staring at my boobs. But the truth is, I really do want to do this with you. I don't think I'd regret it at all. You know what I mean Ted, I'm ready. Fancy? What? Hmm, Ted, I see what you're doing. You're trying to lower my expectations for tonight. Is this a lengh thing? Quick on the draw? Unexpected number of testicules? Virginity 2: Eletric Boogaloo? Oh Ted, of course it's gonna be worth it. Stop worrying. It's you and me. It already has everything it needs. (They kiss each other) It happens. I knew a guy in med school... we used to joke that we was one ball away from getting walked. (They laugh) Hey. Ted. Five years. Straight to the hotel. Hey, guys. Yeah. Definitly. It's been such a long time since I've had a night out. Um, what are you guys talking about? Ted, you told them, didn't you? You told them that I haven't had s*x in five years. (She seems embarrassing) Ted, that was so personal. Plus, now your friends think I'm a freak. Look, I realize it's weird, okay? Not many people go five years without having s*x. That's why it was difficult for me to tell you. But I did tell you because I thought that I could trust you. Obviously, I can't. You know there's always a reason not to sleep with a guy, and you just gave me yours. Why would be looking for one?"
797,3,18,ted ,"I'm saying I don't wanna be friends anymore. It's Barney. (To Barney, in the phone) Dude, seriously you need to stop calling me.  Yeah I never called you, you called me fifteen times and my parents twice. No I'm not. Goodbye Barney. (He hangs up) No. I'm not mad at anybody. I've forgiven you. And I've outgrown Barney as a friend. It's that's simple. I know, I was in the top bunk. Also sat next to you at football games. I think she wants to make sure we are serious first, that's why she hasn't introduced me to her daughter either. She wants to take things slow. Look, I'm crazy about this girl, if waiting is what it takes, then I'm fine with that. And totally unrelated note. Does anybody have gamma icer or a piece of bark that you are not chewing? Let's have s*x. Right now, I'll lock the door. We can do it against the door. It'll be hot! It'll be like a three-way: you, me and the door. I'm sorry. We're waiting. It's cool. I was afraid of this. You're 14. Wow. It's funny that you say that. Me too. It's been a while. It's been five months for you too? But nobody in five years? In my defense, they were staring at me. Actually... Your pillow talk's a little rusty. That's great. Like ""right now"" ready? (She laughs) So, her sister's driving up to baby-sit Lucy, and we're getting a hotel room in the city Saturday night. It's a lot of pressure, isn't it? I don't know Lily, after five years, her expectations have gotta be pretty high. I really gonna have to bring my A-game to satisfy this woman. Not Nell Carter... Stella. Because you're dead inside? Right, right, and then no matter what happens, she'll be happy. I have a surprise appetizer for us today. Check it out. Potato skins. Yeah. Right? God, it's been forever since I had potato skins. I remember them as being pretty much the most delicious things ever. (He eats the potato skin) Huh. That's surprising. This potato skin. It's good but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head. Even though potato skin performed admirably, and is a totally respectable size... I couldn't enjoy it because of my own unrealistic expectations. No. No. No. It's just that this is a big deal for you. I mean, it's like your virginity: the sequel. (She laughs) Exactly, and I don't want to mess it up. I don't want you to ever wonder if was worth it. ""Unexpected number of testicules?"" Hey. So, here's the plan. Take a horse-drawn carriage through the park, and it just so happens the Philharmonic is playing an open-air... Straight to the hotel? I'll get my bag. (Ted go to his bedroom) Hey guys. Told them what? Stella, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told them. But they're my best friends. I tell them everything. I-I didn't even think about it. No, they don't. You can trust me. Wait, did I gave you a reason or were you looking for one?"
798,3,18,willie ,"What up B dog, long time no bro, so are we gonna tire it up tonight or what? Here is what on the rocket tocket. My wife is gonna put the cheese out at seven, scrabble at 8:00 PM, 9 PM we watch 27 dresses, everybody's home by 11:00. Booya! (Barney hangs up and he remakes a phone call to Willie) Hello?"
799,3,18,,"Barney (he is at work, in the phone): Ted, I'm sorry, I haven't returned your calls."
800,3,19,abby ,"Abby. Well, you slept with me and then you never called me again. That's it. Well, it hurt, okay? And then Ted, the love of my life started dating my boss instead of me. Do you know how that feels? Abby! Ted said Marshall was his best friend. Sorry. I hate Ted. Are you as turned on as I am? I'm sorry I yelled out ""Ted."" I am Abby. You know what I hate most about Ted? His stupid hair. His stupid, lame awesome hair. It's so stupid and awesome. What? He's so lame and awesome. Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? You're thinking of having s*x with Ted? That's right. And girlfriends are lame. Unless they're me. I miss you, Ted. We're showing Ted how lame he is. We can't stop breathing, Ted. Your hair looks amazing. Wait, really? Yes, I'll marry you. Thank you, thank you. I have to call my mom. It finally happened, Mama. I just wish Daddy were alive to walk me down the aisle. Hi, sweetie. No, I'm in wedding-planning mode. Stressville. Population: me. Okay, big decision. What do you think the cake should be: Fudgie the Whale or Cookie Puss? So I'm thinking Labor Day. I was going to say Fourth of July, but I don't want to steal any attention away from America. What? Really? Oh, my God, thank you. But now I feel wrong keeping this."
801,3,19,barney ,"So I threw the pressure air oxygen into its mouth. I shoot the tank, boo, nomore shark. Mr. Hall and I swam back to shore. Hey,let me serve you a drink. So where were we? Again? Really? Wait... Hey, excuse me. Did I sleep with you and then totally screw you over? What are you doing on Friday? Stop! Amy? Riiiggghhhttt!!! Why are you trying to ruin my life? And? That's it? As far as I'm concerned, if I leave you safe on dry land with adequate transportation home, you've got nothing to complain about. Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley. Abby. A few weeks ago, Ted dumped me as his wingman. You had a crush on him for a couple weeks? I was Ted's best friend for seven years. Seven years! Ted. What an idiot. With his stupid ""meaningful relationship"" with Stella. I hate Ted more. Probably not quite as much. I'm sorry I yelled out ""Abby."" Oh, cool. What? You know what I hate most about Ted? How he's always like, ""Oh, I want to fall in love and have a relationship. I care about the people I have s*x with."" He's so lame. You know what he needs? He needs to see just how horrible he is when he's in a relationship. I think so. Ted, fancy bumping into you here. Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby? Hi, Abby. That's right. I am done with this whole being awesome thing. Now I'm all about farmers' markets and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie? Abby and I are in love. Not hot passionate love. Couple love. You know, movie night with my girlfriend, then waiting for her to go to bed so I can steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor. You don't have to say it, though. Stop what, Ted? Stop being in love? Next he'll ask us to stop breathing. Not before I share with you what being in a relationship leads to, Ted. Abby, Pookie Bear... I am so pathetically desperate for you that... aw, heck, I'll just say it. Would you marry me? I would never joke about true love. Okay. That's you. Uh, yes, she does. Totally committed to the bit. Hey, I think I left my tie here. Have you seen it? Yeah, that was a bit. We were doing a bit. Abby, I've... I've got some bad news. I can't marry you. Ted begged me not to. I think he's in love with you. Yes, our plan worked better than we ever dreamed. You have to go to him. Here's his home address. But you know what? He works late, so I wouldn't go before 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning. Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that. That's made of candy. Later."
802,3,19,dr greer," I had to make a trash run. Been a busy day-- lots of neuterings.  Oh, n-n-no, it's not what you think. Oh, thank God. Yeah, yeah, yeah, mostly just dog testicles.  Anyway... I noticed your painting just sitting right there on top and I thought, ""Hey,free painting,"" so I brought it upstairs and hung it up in Exam Room 3, and then the strangest thing happened. Hey, Muffin. Whoa, I think he remembers me from the last time he was here. Take Muffin to Exam Room 3. I'll meet you there. I went in, expecting the worst. I'd never seen Muffin that calm, and then a little later the same thing happened again with Tidbit... and King Larry... and again with the Weinstein triplets.  Something about your art speaks to the canine sensibility on a very primal level.  Yeah. But you know who it bums out? Birds. Yeah. Had a parrot in there today. He took one look at it, pried open his cage, flew right into the ceiling fan."
803,3,19,lawrence ,"Talk about a nice frame. My, my, you are a big one, aren't you? And you're married to that little bit of a thing. How does that work? I'd like to find out. Walter. Boots."
804,3,19,lily ,"A rainbow! That's beautiful! What a beautiful rainbow! Another rainbow? It's beautiful! You're kidding me. Seriously, aren't you sick of these things? Today, I yelled at a little girl for painting a rainbow. But we can barely afford that to begin with. Whoa! Marshall, that's just a game we play in the bedroom. What? Why just my clothes? You made a Website? No, you know what would be a better name for the site? Guy-forces-his-wife- to-dress-in-a-garbage-bag- for-the-next- three-years-dot-com. That's real. Hmm, but, girlfriend, you cannot pull off a tall kitchen. ""The Magnificent Kevin."" I don't want to sell my clothes! I'll sell my paintings! Yeah, I'll sell my paintings. Good oil paintings go for like, $500. What does that mean? You don't believe in me. Marshall, I am proud of my work as an artist. My paintings are good. I bet Robin would buy one. What now? Well, how much money do we need for the contractor to finish the job? Okay. So, if I can sell three of my paintings at 500 bucks a pop, then I get to keep all my clothes. Well, give me a week. Fine. You do? It's not for sale! My clothes are not for sale! We've been sitting here for hours and nobody's even glanced at my painting. Come on. Let's start talking it up. Painting for sale! $500! Lifelong dream hanging in the balance! It's like they don't even see us. Oh, I'm trying to fix the hardwood floors in my new apartment. You? Do you like hero1n? Thanks for your honesty, Crazy Sock Guy. Oh, I'm never gonna sell this... 500 bucks! Who's a real painter now, Marshall? Oh, I know, sweetie. And since I'm a professional artist now, I'm going to sketch you an Aldrin original, you know, to say thanks for being such a supportive husband. I'm thinking about calling it... ""Suck It!"" Well, that's the best part. A gay couple without kids. A G-CWOK! Yeah, that's right. They are the heart and soul of the art-buying community. That's an amazing idea. I'm going to go call them. I can probably sell two more paintings with time to spare. Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something I had to tell you. What was it? Oh, that's right. Suck it. Yes, Lily Aldrin. I sold you the painting earlier today. You sound happy. Well, I just wanted to offer you an exclusive chance to view some of my other paintings. What? So... y-you didn't like my painting? Okay. Well, if you didn't want the painting, can I... can I at least get it back? Where is it? I see. H-He threw out my painting. This is great. My dream of becoming an artist is dead, and now I'm watching my wardrobe disappear piece by piece. There goes my favorite dress. This dress meant a lot to me. Yeah. It was spring of 2004 and I had been having a hard few months. I got a two-syllable ""damn"" in this dress. Yeah. Now she belongs to... CanadaGirl(a)MetroNewsOne.com. What? Really? Why? Well, what happened? Yeah, we get it. Gay guys like you. The painting! Dr. Greer? Who's Dr. Greer a-and why did he take my painting? Ooh, we don't need the details. Really? Dogs like my paintings? Really? That's two grand. That's more than we need for the contractor. In what? Well, it's not exactly the clientele I had in mind, but... thank you for believing in me. We're having an auction to rise money for the children's hospital of Los Angeles"
805,3,19,man ,"Yeah, we're dirt to them. What do you need money for? hero1n. Love it. In fact, if you sell that, I'm going to take your money and go buy some more hero1n. It's not very good. 2 Oh, my God! Da-amn."
806,3,19,man 2," Oh, honey, hello.  Are you kidding? We're popping the champagne right now.  Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, oh, I guess I should have told you. We just bought that for the frame.  Yeah, it's an original Anton Kreutzer, a very rare frame from the turn of the century.  Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, no, not at all. But you know, good for you.  Yeah, no, we don't have it anymore.  Champagne for everyone on me, the happiest guy in the world.  Well, hello."
807,3,19,marshall ,"So, uh, I just met with the contractor. and it turns out, that fixing the floors of the new apartment is going to cost a lot more than the estimate. I hate to say this, but I think you're going to have to sell your stuff. I mean your clothes. All those designer pieces and everything. We can sell my stuff, too, but I got to tell you, I think your Marc Jacobs cocktail dress is going to go for a lot more than my ""Split Happens"" bowling shirt. I'm not selling that. I've already made the Website. Yeah, it's called ""Lily-and-Marshall-sell- their-stuff-dot-com."" I'm worried. That woman is actually wearing a-a garbage bag. Hey, Lil, if I were to say ""Ted could never pull them off,"" What would I be talking about? Oh, okay, uh, today's category: classic Westerns that involve red cowboy boots. Ooh, ooh! Robin. ""No Country for Straight Men."" Lily,listen, we really need the money. I have some leads on a job, but until then, I just... I don't know what else we can do. What? Yeah. Totally. But... I love it. It's a masterpiece. That's it. We're selling the TV. I just want to come home and stare at this all day. Aw. Somebody call the cops! My wife stole an awesome painting from the museum! Look, it just, it just means that-that we need money right now and I'm not sure that selling your paintings is-is how we're going to get it. No, wait, wait! Of c... of course I believe in you! I love your painting, I just... I'm trying to be realistic. About 1,500 bucks. Babe, we need money fast. Okay, a-a week. Fine. Honey, I never said you weren't a real painter. Lily, come on. I'm proud of you. Who-who bought it? Lily, you're not going to believe this. Something amazing happened. I went to the G-CWOK's apartment. Because I felt guilty. This auction was my idea and now you've had to sit around all day while a bunch of vultures ruthlessly pick apart the carcass of your wardrobe. And more importantly, I honestly love that painting and I couldn't stand to think of it in a trashcan someplace. Hi, um... Lawrence. I-I'm here about the painting my wife Lily solyou-- the one in the nice frame. No, Lily, they love me, but that's not the important part. Right, so, um, they told me they threw it in the building's Dumpster. It wasn't in there, but the super told me that he'd seen one Dr. Greer-- a veterinarian who works in the building-- take the painting out of the trash. You're about to find out. Anyway, because your first painting worked so well, I convinced Dr. Greer to buy four more. Mm-hmm, at $500 a piece. Yeah, but I was actually thinking we could reinvest it. In you. Man, birds do not get you. Hey, go to lilyandmarshallselltheirstuff.com or charityfolks.com. You could get tons of cool stuff on the sell and they all use for great cause."
808,3,19,robin ,"Oh, yeah, like there's nothing in your closet you've never worn? Whatever, red cowboy boots. His red cowboy boots. ""The Good, the Bad, and the Fabulous."" Oh, I know, sweetie. Come here. Is this a hundred percent silk? Wow! I really like that painting! It's neat! The-the colors are neat. The-the shapes are neat. It's really just... neat. What? Yes, and you can still enjoy it even if you're not a pretentious douche. Uh, then again, red cowboy boots. Really? A two-syllable ""damn."" That's the dream. It's still in the family. It's still in the family."
809,3,19,ted ,"Hey, how was your day? A rainbow? Sounds like that bitch had it coming. Dude. This is insane. Has Lily even worn half this stuff? As a matter of fact, no, there isn't. Those are nice boots. I totally pull those off. I totally pull them off! It's a classic Western look. Pulling... Them... Off. Observe. I think there's a dynamic quality to the brushwork that, combined with the fluid composition, creates an almost Kandinsky-like emotional resonance. Can you clarify something for me about your critique? Are the colors ""neat"" or are they more ""neato burrito?"" I pull these off! (Everyone is laughing at him) I pull these off! You bagged a G-CWOK?! You know what you should do? You should call up the G-CWOKs and offer them a free painting if they throw a private art party for all their G-CWOK friends. Uh, yeah. Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now? Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop. Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing. Please stop. Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding. Here's the important part. Since you're clearly a man of impeccable taste and style, I-I came down here to ask you: what do you think of the boots? I'll be in the cab. G-CWOK-approved."
810,3,19,walter ,Pulling... Them.... Off.
811,3,19,woman ,"Jerk! No. I love it. Yeah, your top. It's gorgeous. Is that 100% silk?"
812,3,19,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, in the spring of 2008 something kind of strange have been happening to your uncle Barney. He's been doing great with a woman. Ted from 2030: He's only been gone a few moments but when he return... Ted from 2030:...he gets slap! It kept happening... Ted from 2030: Until finally Lily was approached by a mysterious woman who wants her stay away from Barney...so when it happened once more... Ted from 2030: Barney knew who to look for... Ted from 2030: Kids, sometimes you can do something right a thousand times in a row... Ted from 2030: But then, that thousand-and-first time... Ted from 2030: Kids, sometimes you can do something right a thousand times in a row... Ted from 2030: But then, that thousand-and-first time... Marshall:...that kind of money only goes for real paintings. Ted from 2030: Lily's first move on a great art challenge of 2008 was to display one of her favorite paintings at her friend's gallery. The night didn't go so well. But then at the last minute... Ted from 2030: So the next day, Lily took her painting to a coffee house that displayed local artists. Ted from 2030: After four days without selling a single painting, Lily was getting desperate. Ted from 2030: And just as she was about to lose all hope, something amazing happened. Ted from 2030: Marshall explained that he was building a fancy new Web site specifically to sell Lily's artwork to veterinarians. Lily & Marshall: Thanks."
813,4,1,april ,"So are you... nervous about the game? When my family gets to Yankee Stadium, are the tickets under your name or mine?"
814,4,1,barman ,Last call.
815,4,1,barney ,"""Bogeyman with a teleprompter."" That's hilarious! Great joke, Robin, great joke. Are you kidding? That was a great joke. It's smart, funny, beautiful, the whole package. It's everything you're afraid to let yourself want. In a joke. ""Bogeyman with a teleprompter."" Classic. I could tell you knew something was up with me, and you're right. But I can't tell you what it is. I should tell you, but I can't! I have to. I never will! I'm going to. Let's just drop it. What's up with you? I think I'm in love with Robin. It's not ""sweet."" It's like a disease. I slept with Robin one time and I caught feelings. I caught feelings bad. I used protection and everything. They're terrible! I can't eat, I can't sleep. She's all I think about. I close my eyes, I see Robin. I, I hear a song; it reminds me of Robin. I sleep with that chick, I'm thinking about Robin. I'm sorry, I don't follow you. That's like saying, ""How can an ant carry ""20 times its body weight, but root beer floats are still delicious?"" Are the two even related? Really? ""Boyfriend""? I don't want to be Robin's boyfriend. I don't know. I just want to be with her. All the time. I want to hear about her day and tell her about mine. I want to hold her hand and smell her hair. But I don't want to be her stupid boyfriend. Look, Lily, are you going to help me out with this or not? Deal. So just call her up? Hi, Robin..(he jabbers something and hang up) She wasn't there. I left a voice mail. Yeah, but those were just booty calls. On a booty call, you barely even have to talk. Around 9:00 p.m., you say... Hey, baby, it's Barney. You busy tonight? Sweet. See you in half an hour? Can't wait. But the later it gets, the fewer words you need. And by 3:00 in the morning... Sweet. It's no worse than your super-obvious code words. Ah, ah, it's her, it's Robin. What do I do? No-no-no-no, aah! Robin... Great to hear from you. To what do I owe the pleasure? Help me! How are you feeling today? At what age did you first get your period? No, I did not. Robin, I was wondering if... Nothing. Gotta go. Bye. That was just a practical joke. I'm not really in love with Robin. You should've seen the look on your face. There's cameras right there and there and there. What a legendary prank that we're never going to speak of again. Where are the boys? I thought this was a group thing. Why? Wait, wait, I can't do this. She'll never take me seriously. She thinks I'm some womanizing idiot. You mean the insecure, touchy-feely she-male who sounded alarmingly close to Ted? Wish me luck. So, Robin... tell me about your day, and not just what happened, how you felt about what happened. I'm not looking to problem-solve, I'm just looking to listen. Like what? I'm being Barney, and I think tonight's going to be de... wait for it... lightful. Delightful. Is insurance going to cover that? Sometimes they don't. Your teeth look fantastic. Thanks. I don't always want to be that guy. Sometimes I want to be someone you can have an actual conversation with. Now, tell me something about you that I don't know yet. Seriously. Why not? We both know you're more than that. Promise me you'll apply. Promise me you'll apply. To taking chances. You know, Robin, there's actually something, I do want to talk to you about. Of course it is. One more for the road? So, here's the deal. Would you excuse us for one sec? What are you doing? Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not. I'm just some guy who's in love with the girl that just left, and she's never going to feel the same way. So I'm just going to go. And that was it. My name, and tell your nephews to bring their mitts. They're going to be in foul ball country. Come on. The Robin stuff was completely true. I choose bimbos. Bimbos make me happy. Bimbos make me feel alive. Bimbos make me want to pretend to be a better man. This whole thing with Robin was just a fling, but at the end of the day, my heart belongs to bimbos. Oh, I'm not confused. You know who is confused? Bimbos. They're easily confused. It's one of the thousand little things I love about them. I love their vacant, trusting stares, their sluggish, unencumbered minds, their unresolved daddy issues. I love them and they love me. Bimbos have always been there for me, through thick and thin. Mostly thin. B- man don't do thick crust. What up?"
816,4,1,girl ,Morning.
817,4,1,lily ,"Barney, no offense to Robin, but that wasn't that funny. Okay, what is so urgent that you called me and begged me to come over at 7:22 in the morning? Barney, just say it. I don't believe it. I thought you called me over here to uncuff you from your s*x swing again, but you're in love? That is so sweet! Barney, you don't ""catch"" feelings, you just have them. And they're good. You love her? Barney, how can you be in love, and still be sleeping with anything that moves? Barney, you're going to have to stop screwing around if you want to be Robin's boyfriend. Well, what do you want, then? Barney, what you just described is a relationship between a boyfriend and a girlfriend. And a pretty clingy one at that. I'm a kindergarten teacher. I see a confused, little kid in the corner trying to eat the lefty scissors, I gotta help the poor, little b*st*rd. But only if you stop sleeping around. Deal? Robin just needs to see this new see of you. Just call her up. You left a voice, but it wasn't male. Barney, I don't get it. You've called a million girls a million times. A question mark? You got laid off a question mark? Rhinoceros. Great. Now we need a new code word. Just ask her something. Something personal. Just ask her out. Gross. I lied. They're not coming and I'm about to leave. Because... they're not in love with Robin, and neither am I. I mean, she's great and sweet. I'm not going to pretend that I haven't noticed her body, but this is off topic. Good luck. We both know you're more than that. Show Robin the Barney I met the other day. Ted hit that for over a year. I'm so sorry, Barney. You can't give up. You know, it may take some time, but once Robin sees the new you... Damn it, Barney. I mean, for the last time, you can't... you can't be in love with Robin and still be sleeping with every bimbo on the planet. You have to choose right now. What? This is just a defense mechanism, because you're afraid of getting hurt. You're just confused. See you, Barney."

819,4,1,marshall ,"Hey, Lily needs some gift ideas for Stella's wedding shower. Does she like to cook? What's her favorite color? Well, does she have any hobbies? Dude, you don't know anything about the woman you're marrying. What color are her eyes? Which is? No, Ted, I like Stella a lot. She's a Mets fan. It's just that everything with you has moved so fast. You've only known each other a few months. Don't you think maybe you should slow things down a little bit? Get to know each other better? We have to go. She's never seen Star Wars?! Ted, the only people in the universe who haven't seen Star Wars are the characters, and that's 'cause they lived them. That's 'cause they lived theStar Wars. I told you. You didn't know this girl well enough. What if... you show it to her, she doesn't like it? Star Wars is your all-time favorite movie, and whether or not Stella likes it is actually important. It's like, it's a test of how compatible you guys are. You can't. I do. Off to a bad start. I'm making sure my best friend is marrying the right woman. That's what I'm doing. I really do, don't I? Should I leave, too? She's up to the scene where Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy escape from the Death Star's trash compactor. Great scene! Okay, we should have just heard... but Stella didn't make a peep. I'll tell her you still want to be friends. You hated it, didn't you? Wookiee. He's a Wookiee, and his kind is actually more intelligent than they appear. That is Ted's favorite movie of all time. He watches it when he's home sick with the flu. He watches it on rainy Sunday afternoons in the fall. He watches it on Christmas Eve. Ted watches Star Wars in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad. Do you really think that you can pretend to like a movie that you actually hate for the rest of your life? Then, Ted's a lucky guy. Bear."

Be Barney. Right. So I went to the chiropractor yesterday. That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour. That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man. Who are you? Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you? There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply. Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel. It's not as easy... I promise. To taking chances. Yeah, why not? Hold that thought? April, have... you met Barney? April just finished her shift, she's looking to blow off some steam. You were so nice to me tonight, I wanted to return the favor, wingwoman-style. So, as I was saying, Barney is the Yankees' new second-baseman. And Barney, April asked if tomorrow, you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match. You can't make this stuff up. So, you two kids have fun."
825,4,1,stella ,"No. Oh, God, no. You want me to marry..(laughing).No. Oh, I'm sorry, Ted. I can't. Mark Johnson, the quarterback from your high school football team, already asked me. Yes. I know dudes think it's girlie for a guy to cook, but us ladies? We find it mighty sexy. Oh, yeah, she did. I'm on fire right now. Delicious. What's in this pesto? Peanuts. You know what, sweetie? I woke up so early and I had a really long day at work. And there was that whole thing where you tried to k*ll me. Can we please just go to sleep? Dale Harris, second grade. You're talking like peck on the cheek or a full-on passionate making out? OK, yeah, Dale Harris, second grade. Dale Harris, second... Billy Devito, sophomore year of college. Slut. Benji,1981. I watched it recently with Lucy and I just thought, ""Oh, that dog is so dead right now."" What about you? You know, I've actually never seen Star Wars. Sounds like a plan. I'm gonna grab a beer. You want one? It's some words flying through space. I'm not going to read that anyway. What? You were staring at me. You don't look so bad yourself, mister. She kisses him on the neck Yeah, Ted, I'm losing wood over here. What's going on? Wait, it's really important to you that I like this movie, isn't it? I'm not gonna like it with you staring at me the whole time. Go to your room and I will come get you when it's over. Go. I loved it. What was that? It was so good. It's so stupid. First of all, how do they understand that walking bear they hang around with all the time? He goes nin nin nin... They're all like, ""That's a good point, Bear, ""let's try that."" I do."
826,4,1,ted ,"Will you marry me? It's Ted! Actually, I don't know. Don't know that either. Yes. She's exactly the kind of person who would have hobbies. And interests, too. I am one lucky son of a bitch. What? You're crazy! I know plenty. The color of the ocean after a storm. Beautiful. Okay, so I don't know every single detail about Stella. What's really about? Do you not like her or something? Really? I'll have a whole life time to get to know her better. Right now, I know the one thing that I have to: that I love her. Really? You know... My grandma taught me how. Yeah. I had a lot of time after school to watch her cook because I wasn't good at sports. Oh, you know, the usual: basil, garlic, olive oil, but can you guess my secret ingredient? Yes. How did you know that? OK, let me think, what else? No, I clearly need to know more about you. Let's do firsts. First kiss? First time you had s*x. Stop it. Prude. Molly McKenzie, junior year of high school. First movie you ever saw. My dad took me to an old drive-in to see the original Star Wars. You've got to calm down. Dude, it's just a movie. It's just a movie. It's just a movie! If Stella doesn't like this movie, I can't marry her. You want to watch it again? I just thought it'd be fun to watch a movie tonight, and since you've never seen Star Wars, I figured why not? No big deal. It's pretty good. The movie's already started, so... Oh, my God. Marshall appears behind the couch. What are you doing down there? What are you doing, hiding behind the couch? You need to get a job. Nothing. You look really beautiful tonight. Great scene, great scene. Star Wars fun fact number seven... George Lucas based the film's structure on Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. He also owes a debt to Campbell's work with comparative mythology. Nothing. What part, what part? Great scene. I'm gonna take a look. She's not even watching. She's texting. I don't believe this. I believe, she knows this is important to me. She's blatantly...(Ted looks at his phone) ""Stop watching me, jackasses."" Yes! I am marrying a woman who is not only hot but loves Star Wars. That's the dream. I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me through the space-time continuum. We did it. We did it, you m*st*rb*t*ng little b*st*rd. Champagne for everybody. Ted leaves the room."
827,4,1,,"Ted(2030): Kids, there is something I wish my dad told me. The longest pause you will ever experience in your life is the one that follows asking the question... Ted(2030): Your brain goes into overdrive, imaging every possible response. Ted (2030): But if you're lucky, she may answer with the single greatest word in the English language. Ted (2030): Stella and I spent that summer happily engaged. Marshall was still coping with unemployment. Ted(2030): Lily threw herself into her painting. Ted(2030): Barney was rehabilitating from his bus accident. Ted(2030): And well, Marshall just kept coping with unemployment. Ted(2030): And Robin continued to uphold the high journalistic standards of Metro News 1."
828,4,2,barney ,"Goliath National Bank. The world leader in credit and banking. God, I love Goliath National Bank! Our company just bought them out in a ruthless takeover. Took two months. Cost 2,000 jobs. It was brutal. Who wants a T-shirt? (He throws one to Ted.) Hey, Marshall, they're hiring in the legal department. I could get you a job. Italian. I don't like Chinese. I just said I don't like Chinese. Weird meats, funny music, side of rice. Why are we splitting hairs? I just said I don't like Chinese. I love this burger so much, I want to sew my ass shut. Name two places where things get stuffed. You know what's not a drag? Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying. Get this. You know who works out at my gym? Regis Philbin. No. No, we don't know where it is. I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear! OK, Regis, we will, we will. All right. You know what else is a mouthful? All that double-talk other banks give you. At Goliath, customer satisfaction is our most important investment. How lame is free automatic bill pay? How lame is 3.3% APY online savings? Yeah, that's right. Hate to make you look stupid in front of your friends, but you left me no choice. He laughs. Reg... (He takes his phone.) That guy scares me. I think I'll leave him a text. All right. I want... to take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie, then take it back to my place, put on a little Terence Trent D'arby, and then I would just... fool around a little bit. Nothing serious, just take it slow, you know? You know, Lil, when times are tough, I like to remember the uplifting words of my favourite song. He starts singing. ""We'll be on your side when you need a friend. Through thick and thin you can always depend. On the world leaders in credit and banking. Goliath National Bank."" Member FDIC. Barney Stinson. I'm sorry, this is...? Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now. Onions? Okay, no onions. One of 9,000 convenient locations. What the... It's not my... Stop, okay. She hits his knee. Stop that, Lily. Marshall, Geez. Will you just tell her already? Well, technically not together. You won't have access to my floor. If only there were an easy, convenient way to get some cash right now. Member FDIC. This feels so good. I'm worried I'm gonna get this burger pregnant. That's outrageous."
829,4,2,everybody ,Sweet! You shouldn't have. That's so kind of you. Are you kidding me? What? Yes! What? Come on.
830,4,2,lily ,"Barney, Marshall didn't quit his last soul-sucking corporate job just to go work at a bank. He's gonna be an environmental lawyer. We had sushi last night. My God. This burger is so good. It's like Christmas in my mouth, meat Christmas. Probably tucked between her legs. Honey, I'm so excited for you. After all these interviews, after all these disappointments, you deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat. Barney, I hate to break this to you, but working for a bank's kind of lame. I think I just had my first burg-asm. And you got our wedding vows off the Internet. Marshall's not doing so well, guys. He really needs to get a job. It started a couple of weeks ago. Hey, baby. Did you put on pants today? It was funny at first, but then it became a daily thing. I thought, ""Okay, well, at least he's not leaving the house like that."" Then, one day, he opened the door to get the paper. Day after that, went downstairs to get the mail. We've got to find Marshall that burger. No, if Marshall says this isn't the burger, this isn't it. Excuse me. Did you guys change cooks or something? Because my husband was here 5 years ago, he's sure he had a different burger. Robin is trying to take the plate. This is your fault, you and your stupid bank. You did this. I will never use a Goliath ATM ever again. Goliath National Bank sucks. It's the worst bank on the face of the earth. Attention, New Yorkers, this bank sucks! They suck! They suck, suck! Tell me what? Tell me what? What? Where? But you want to be an environmental lawyer. You've got great pants. I love you. I'm sorry you didn't get your burger. I paid for the cab. I want to get tiny fitted sheets for this burger, and just... crawl into this bun, get all cosy, and die there."
831,4,2,man ,"I couldn't help but overhear. I know the place you're talking about. It's a place called the Corner Bistro. Greatburger. You know, that burger place isn't gone. It just moved to a new location. And I can tell you where that is for a hundred bucks."
832,4,2,marshal ,"So I went for a walk in the big, scary city. And I discovered something amazing: it wasn't scary at all. All right. What's the word? Thank you."
833,4,2,marshall ,"You are confident, you are energetic, you are focused! I thought you started that yesterday. It's okay. Guys, guys, guys. When you've had the best burger in NY, every other burger tastes like my grandpa's feet. But you guys eat up, enjoy my grandpa's feet. It was eight years ago, my first week in New York, and for a kid from Minnesota, the big city was a scary place. Oh, thank God it's just you. Why would I have to leave? I can have anything I want delivered, and New York City cable is awesome. Have you seen this public access show with the old Jewish lady in a bikini? (Laughing) It's disgusting. What if I do, Ted. I don't have a switchblade. I don't know how to break-dance and win the begrudging respect of a street gang. No. Look, the old lady in a bikini is back on. I'm just gonna lie back and get comfortable. Okay. (He takes the bat discreetly.) Fine. And then, right when I started to get a little hungry, I turned a corner... And there it was. So, I went inside. Ted, you got to wake up. Wake... I'm all right. Ted, I've just had the most amazing burger of my life! It's this awesome little place, Regis Philbin eats there, so it's sort of like a celebrity hot spot. But the burger. The burger. Dude. I don't know. (Looking to his watch.) Does stuff in New York stay open past... 9:30? Wait, Penny Noir was a drag queen? Anyways, we never found the place. Now, eight years have passed, still... No burger. Okay, here we go. No, you don't. Oh, the Corner Bistro! It's amazing, I spent a quarter of my life searching for the best burger in New York City, but silly me, it never occurred to me to check the highest-rated burger in the Zagat guide. Wow, thanks a lot, guy. Let me return the favor. Great cup of coffee: Starbucks. Robin, I've tried every so-called best burger in New York City trying to find that burger. Or at least forget about her. We're going. But none of those places even came close. The autographed picture. That's the one, Mr. Philbin. Do you remember where it is? No. That's where my story ends. Now I'm doomed to walk the earth forever searching for that green door and that red neon sign that says ""Burger."" Yeah. I knew it was on a numbered street! I cannot believe we're finally gonna have this burger Green door, red neon sign. Guys, this is the place. I've actually, I prepared a few words. Thank you. This isn't it. It's not it. Just a burger? It's so much more than just a burger. I mean, that first bite... Oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like a sesame-freckled breast of an angel, resting gently on the ketchup and mustard below. Flavors mingling in a seductive ""pas de deux"". And then... a pickle the most... playful... little pickle, and then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce, and a... a patty... of ground beef, so... exquisite...swirling in your mouth, breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savories so... delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread. This is God... speaking to us through food. Okay, look, so, so this, this isn't the place. All right, it's no big deal. It's another place with a green door and a red neon sign that says ""Burger"". I'll just... I'll call every restaurant in Manhattan and ask 'em what colour their door is. No big deal, right? Let's do this. Heads! It's going to be heads. It's almost usually heads. Hey! Nope. They laugh. We're going. 106. A numbered street. Of course. Stop the cab! Wait. This is it. This is it. It was ri... it was right here. It was... it was right on this very spot. I got a job. Goliath National Bank. That's why Barney's been going on and on about how, how great Goliath is. He wanted you to be excited for me since we will to working together. Yeah and I also want to be a Harlem Globetrotter and get paid in candy, but in the meantime, I need a job, and this is, this is a really good one. It's great pay and there's good benefits, and to be honest, it gives me a reason to put on pants in the morning. You know, I have my whole life to save the planet, but right now I'm kind of really excited to wear pants again. I love you. It's stupid. I think about that first week in New York. You know? I was 22 years old. I had my whole future ahead of me. I guess I just kind of thought that if I could have that burger one more time and feel that way for one more night, that I might be able to check that off the list, and grow up, go work for the stupid bank, and just... be happy. Let's pay the man. I haven't worked since March. Thank you. This is it. It's exactly the same. It's the best burger in New York. Go ahead, eat up, eat up. If he does get that burger pregnant, I have dibs on the delicious burger babies. You were just freakin' teasing us."
834,4,2,marshall voiceover, And I ordered the burger.  So we went out to get another burger. But after hours of searching...
835,4,2,regis ,"That is unbelievable. Wait. This is it! No, really."
836,4,2,regis philbin,"What are you waiting for? Get out and find the burger!  Let's go, all of you!  Now, Kathy, your last flip was heads. The one before that was tails. You polled the audience; they came out split, 50/50. No help at all there. So, for $258,000... I have to ask you, Kathy, what's it gonna be: heads...or... (His phone rings, he reads the text and starts to leave the studio.) Excuse me. Oh, boy. I've got to go. I've got to go!  Regis. I'm at the place.  What? Uptown? He breaks a mail box. Fine, fine, I'll be there in 20. If you get there first, medium rare.  This isn't it."
837,4,2,robin ,"Great, we'll take five of those. Yeah, I'm freaking starving. I just finished a seven-day cleanse. I finished early, OK? (To Wendy) Five of those. No. We always do this. We spend an hour arguing about where to eat, and we end up here anyway. I haven't eaten for two days. Can we please, for the love of God, just order something now? Oh. God. Of course, mine comes last. Go ahead, start without me. And you've had the best burger in New York? You couldn't find it? Where do you think it was? So I take it you've tried the Corner Bistro. Green door, red neon sign that says ""Burger?"" I know that place. I've walked by it a million times. It's on West 12th, right off of 7th. Finally. No... I will eat your hand. Please, go ahead, start. Just shut up and eat. I mean, it is just a burger. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this isn't just about a burger. What about the underpants? How big is Marshall's underpants radius? I'm not eating that burger. Finally. Damn it. I don't understand. Where is the burger place? That's fine. Let's just eat here. But... food. They're unopened. They're barbecue. Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me."
838,4,2,ted ,"Okay, first of all, you look like the last pick in the draft. And, second, why are you so excited about some bank? So, what do you guys want to do for dinner? Really? You want to eat here? Wait. What about sushi? I had Italian for lunch. Chinese? Indian? Indian isn't Chinese. Mexican? It's like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's. Where the chef k*lled it and ran it through the meat grinder. You are being ridiculous. (Taking the bat.) Tell me, you left the apartment today? Marshall, you have to get over this paranoia. You are not gonna get mugged. That's it, you're taking a walk. Come on, go. Go outside, go, go. Leave the bat. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? I want one of those burgers right now! Do you think they're still open? We didn't know our way around. Just getting back to the apartment took us three hours and one very helpful drag queen. There was that one time we thought we had a break in the case, remember? We should probably call Regis. Oh my god. I'm never brushing my teeth again unless it's with a toothbrush made from this burger. Marshall, you might not want to hear this, but... is it at all possible this is the same Tell them about the underpants. Everyone's got an underpants radius. For most of us, it's the distance from the bedroom to the bathroom, but as your self-esteem gets smaller, your underpants radius gets bigger. Come on, Lily, he'll find a job eventually. Lily, I think we're all eating that burger. What? Uptown? Where? It's not a burger place anymore; it's a Goliath National Bank ATM. We can't eat here. It's an ATM. Robin, no! Give it. Give it! I have any cash. All right, Marshall, remember. It might not taste as good. This place has changed, you've changed, New York has changed. Just... don't get your hopes up too high, okay?"
839,4,2,waitress ,"Yeah, we get this a lot. This place is modelled after this other place uptown with the same green door and ""Burger"" sign. 106th and Manhattan Avenue."
840,4,2,wendy ,"Oh, we just got a new cook. You have to try the burger, it's amazing. Five burgers. Five burgers. I can come back. Robin, yours will be right out."
841,4,2,,"Ted from 2030: When I first moved to New York, it was dingy, disgusting, ugly, flea-ridden, stinky and altogether terrifying, but then, sadly. The whole city started to go uphill. The streets got a little cleaner, the rents got a little higher, and one by one, the crappy old places we loved began to disappear. The Elbow Room, an old punk rock club, became a drugstore. McHale's, a working-class watering hole, became a fast-food place. And Fez, a Moroccan-themed lounge, became a bank. And not just any bank. Ted from 2030: That was the plan, anyway. (We can see Marshall in front of the mirror of the bathroom.) Over the next few weeks, Marshall went on a lot of interviews. Ted from 2030: A lot of interviews. Marshall(to the mirror): You are flexible on salary, you're willing to compromise, you're not gonna cry this time. Ted from 2030: Too many interviews. Marshall(to the mirror): You are sad, you are beaten down, you will get through this, come home, get in your big underpants and take a nap. Ted from 2030: Which brings us to September 29, the night of the burger. Man in the street (Distributing pamphlets): Your search is over! Marshall (Raising hands in the sky.): Damn it! Where is this place? Regis Philbin (Lifting weights): Of course I remember the place. It was the best burger I ever had. I still have dreams about this burger. Beautiful, haunting dreams! I wake up at night screaming, ""Get out of my head, burger! Get out!"" Regis Philbin(He knocks in a bag of boxing.): No! I never wrote it down. But not a day goes by that I don't regret it. (To Marshall) Why? Why? Do you know where it is? Regis Philbin (Threatening him with his fists.): And if you tell me it's at the Corner Bistro, I'm gonna smack you right in the face! Regis Philbin (Taking Barney by the collar): Listen, Blondie! Don't mess with me! Daddy needs his meat. Regis Philbin (To Marshall): What about you, Lurch? (To Ted) And what about you, satchel-mouth? (Giving a card to Barney) This is my cell. You find that burger; you call me day or night. Marshall (taking Robin's burger in his hands): No! Robin! If any of us is gonna eat a burger tonight, it's gonna be the best burger in New York. We're going downtown! He throws away the burger. ""Million Dollar: Heads or Tails"" - Studio set Marshall:Let's just go inside then. Shall we? Waitress:Yours will be right out. Regis Philbin (in front of the last restaurant): Barney, where the hell are you? Regis Philbin (screaming): Onions? Man in the streets: Your search is over. We got girls taking off their clothes. Robin (Licking an envelope.): A hundred bucks? That's crazy. Ted from 2030: So we paid the guy, and 20 minutes later... Ted from 2030: And so, after finally tasting again the burger he'd craved for so many years, Marshall got up the next morning, put on some pants, and went to work, and he never looked back."

843,4,3,barney ,"Well, I must go to Stella. Tonight is the big night. I tried before, I always failed. This time I will succeed. Tonight... I am a lesbian. Robin, your lipstick. Hi, Ted. T-Diddy! You've missed that! First, I no longer have my gold medallions. I sold them when they are out of date, 400 years ago. Yeah, and I want another drink for this girl, Doris. I know I can ask this aircraft lesbian. You can be at 22h. No thank you. I play not with aquariums unless they are my two favorite animals: the pilot fish and torturlute. Did you see! Marshall. Lily. Stella. I fall not rest until we not make me respect for another person's knuckles brushing against mine so sweet, but manly.Small, small... Small, small... Small... Who's the baby? Know that as long as it does not have what he wants. No, deserves.This fist will not waver. It... bow... not. Guys, I'm sure the dog had to soaring after swallowing the tablet X. Too good! Go! Air Hockey. Well done my fat. Seriously, I thought it was the only one. Too much!(Robin arrives in the basement) You're glowing. Tape the Barnacle. How so? Naughty. You can not. If you call now, you'll regret it. I slept with me full of women who were then sent to graze and then decamped. And sometimes they take the phone and they call me and do it again. And when we finished, I see that look on their faces, that look that says they hate themselves and they would never have known. But if you could see this look... In fact, you can see that look, there is a video, http://www... This is the look. I'll give you $ 100 for hitting my fist. $ 200. $ 10 000. They are magnificent... manly tears of pain. They are not emotional. They are a little emotional. Robin, hangs up. Do not do that. Do not do it. It's scary to bet on itself, if you do not, nobody will. I'm not saying that to pat my fist. Even if a punch would be great. I mean it. Oh, yes. Tape for safety. You can not beat A.C. Pity! Nobody needs to know. Chronicles of the Oscar-winning on urban neurotic.Tape! Small town, big men, then tope. Silence embarrassed. Tope then. Look, it did. You think you're there for something? Oh, my God! Thank you! Oh, I k*lled my arm. My arm has never been so sore since I was 13 the day I knew how to close the bathroom. Cool!"
844,4,3,biran ,I can not do that. I can not do that.
845,4,3,joel ,"So, Ms. Papillon wants to return to his cocoon. You can put your socks with your apology, for you have already been replaced. Brian is the makeup and it could not be more excited. Look, although I want to see what college is over for the camera, if you can be here for the 23h, you can get your job."
846,4,3,lily ,"Robin has had the job of presenter. I'm sorry, Ted. I am a New Yorker pure juice. I am programmed to despise and hate New Jersey and all it represents. Why I say that? You hate him more than anyone. Ted, if you m*rder*d me and bury me in New Jersey, I'll haunt thee for ever. I'll leave you alone. I'm sure you had your reasons. It's you who wrote, right? With the next train, you can be in McClaren's to 23h. No, I have to change. I'm not feeling in New Jersey. Yeah, probably. Not good enough. Yes, why not. I thought they came to live with you. You hate that job. How they made you call the Hurricane Hector when he was pouring with rain? You can compete with anyone. You're Robin Scherbatsky. Confident, strong, great. With super long legs that look great in shorts. Drop it, Barney. Your arm should make you suffer. It's the tears? Where is Robin? If you hang up no... You can never be in town in 30 minutes. It is called Paxton. Ok, this is crazy. You can not believe that New Jersey is better than New York. In New York, there was Broadway. No need to say more. Look, Stella, I understand that coming from New Jersey, you think not to like New York, but believe me, Marshall did not believe it either, and now he would move for anything. but, Marshall, you love New York. It really stops. I think so. Good job, Barney. What's the matter? I'm sorry."
847,4,3,lucy ,"Hey, big. There was noise in the cellar. I can not sleep without a story. Why do you not read me one?"
848,4,3,man ,"What's up, Ted? We dined with O'Rourke. I guess is the New Jersey-vegans, now. Honey, look, T-shirt with dogs."
849,4,3,marshall ,"Theodore! But it's empty now. You want us to go in New Jersey? Oh, that's great. It's waiting for you? Why it looks silly? She had a stroke? You wore towels. It's pathetic. It's Saturday night. We should get drunk in a bar. I know this sounds depressing, almost tragic, but it is a fact. No snakes on that plane. What? No! You deserve better than that. It's not so bad. You can put a mini fridge, there, and perhaps an air hockey. So, your first day? No! You're in the eye of cycorde. New Jersey is not so bad. Stella has a lawn. You can have a lawn mower. They sell there. I've seen with a cup holder. I saw a deck chair with a cup holder. I even saw a hammock with a cup holder. You live in New Jersey, you will not have to hold a cup. You'll be on the other side of the river. You'll be in New York all the time. You see? All the time. What do you think guys? Beagle, or Boston terrier? I hate New York! Sorry, but it's true. Today, I passed PriceCo. You've already been? It's huge. The New York stores are cramped. When I turn, I spill something. I'm like a big monster out of the ocean to destroy bodegas. Yes, except I hate it. I'm too big for New York! I try to hold seats in the cramped subway or stoop under doors over 150 years. People are taller, have larger doors. What is your problem? It is too noisy, all the time. Yes, it is the city that never sleeps. Well, I would sleep well. I'm tired for 8 years. Tired and scared, with black and blue marks on my elbows to try to keep between the gateway for elves. New Jersey's great. There are department stores, and lawn and you do not have to wear a cup. For the rest of your life. I'm not afraid to say so. I love New Jersey. Just kidding."

So hurry up and vote for the cutest dog in New York. Four workers were electrocuted when a subway train derailed. Stay here for more... de-rail shocking. Joel, people died. Tonight is my last issue. I arrived in Metro New One as a small caterpillar. And for 4 years, this office was my cocoon.But tonight, I turned into a butterfly ambitious. With an eye on the horizon, a look at the truth, and an eye on you all. Stella has already warned me. It was not. It was not my first day. I arrived and there were 20 people. In fact, I have not really got the job. I just had an interview. I know. He told me that I had had it. I got it? I got it! Thank you! Thank you! I'll call and beg Joel for giving me my job. It was not so bad. A cycorde. That sucks, but I can do what? I will not have another job. You would have seen other women in the interview. They were all more experienced, more ""ethnic"". There was a black girl with blue eyes. How can I compete? I called Joel. Come on. I will not call. Shirley, this is Robin. I called Joel. Sorry, I know, OK? Stop! Joel, this is Robin. I'm sorry for saying all this stuff. Ok, I have half an hour to arrive at the studio. I bet on me. I bet I can be there for 23h. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. I go to before I go down first. Oh, thank you! Wait. Good evening, New York. Our story tonight, the baby panda at the zoo in Central Park made his first tooth today. I think that makes him a... Bear molar. Bear molar. Bear molar. You know what? It's really over for me. Good night, New York. I have not officially got the job. It's OK. They offer me another. Foreign Correspondent. I... moved to Japan."
852,4,3,stella ,"Sorry, we could not wait. It cooled. Are you okay? Exactly, why not you invited your friends to come here? Well, there are games, there are movies. And there shall be beer in the garage. You really hate this part. No, I understand, you're New Yorkers, you need a bar.You could go to the coolest bar in the state, which is so close that you will not believe it. (They descend the basement) and bang, here. The coolest bar in New Jersey. Sorry. Who wants to play Scrabble? Look, the letter ""X"" is a bit difficult to read because a few years ago, she walked into my dog. You know, we should get a dog when you come to live here. Super. This is Robin. Yeah, it could play in the fire escape, be friend with the guy who sleeps on a couch in the driveway, biking on Broadway. Great idea, Ted. not Drink Beer! I remember when I bought it. That was before she became pregnant with Lucy. You can go pick on PriceCo? While you will be there, get yourself a map. You surely will go there all the time. You got the beer? And you registered? Why? What? My daughter goes to school here. All his friends are here. I have lived here all my life. My whole family is here. This is my house. I'm at the EPA. And since June 1, I am the deputy mayor. It moves not, end of discussion. That's what being a parent. I want to uproot Lucy. It is. New York is the largest city in the world. Where the dream come true and of pigeon shit tastes like tapioca. Want a little secret? New Jersey... is better than New York. New York is full of crazies, snobs and bad people. You know that once an old woman called me a slut and gave me a cat in his face? And you want to know if it's the same in New Jersey? 86th and Lex, right in front of your dear little Papaya King. The people of New Jersey are nice. This is the kind of place where you know your neighbors. Yes, that kind? Claxpamon? It was Atlantic City. New Jersey coast. Bruce Springsteen. It's in Hoboken... New Jersey. You know what, Ted... Live wherever you want. I do not care. Really?"
853,4,3,ted ,"Oh, no! Take pictures, okay? Oh, no! Hi, Matisse. Oh, no! Oh, no! What's up, G? Yeah, okay. It's just that... You know, I want to spend time with you, with my friends. I seem to spend my life on the train. It's a great idea. Why? Lily? What? I love New Jersey. Why you say that? And then he walks past me. I hate you not respect the queue more than New Jersey. In fact, this is false. There's nothing I hate more than New Jersey. Great, huh? No, it'll take a while. I have to drop a massive New Jersey. So New Jersey is not my favorite place. But when we get married, and they have moved in with me, I will never stay there. Unless I see the Giants and I evacuated New York or I get rid of a body. And if I assassinate and bury you somewhere else? Yeah, a stroke of genius. This speech is really good. This is a modified version of one I did when I left the swim team because of an ear problem. It's part of the team. Stella has not found a babysitter, you're stuck. Instead, we'll all stay here and it'll be awesome. Come on guys, you promised. We stay there and we try to have fun. We're all here. Being with friends. It's not that the primary? That's great! We have darts. A half ping-pong. An aquarium. Look how it's getting a great night as planned. One could make the bait and watch them fight. For torturlute? You're right. When I what? Me too. My God, I moved to New Jersey? I can not live here. I speak of New Jersey in general, not the basement. She wants me moved? I do not get it. It was discussed there for months. I thought that after marriage, Lucy and you could sit here. I understand why they want to live in New Jersey when you can live in Manhattan? I thought my apartment was one of his reasons for marrying me. Thank you. I can not live here. I hate being here. I would k*ll myself. It asks me no problem holding a cup, unlike you. I'm sorry. You are in New York? Are you in town? When was the last time? It's been closed for six years. I can not do that. I'll tell Stella she and Lucy are coming to town and that's it. Yeah, I took a pack of 144. The rest is in the trunk. No. Was in line for the pictures, my hair is in the air... I want to live in New Jersey. I can not. And I see no reason that you did not come to New York. Yes, but my apartment is close to the Metro. How does it ""end of discussion""? It never was. People with kids are moving all the time. It would be great for Lucy to grow up in the largest city in the world. Better than...? You think...? I... The Empire State Buil...H and H Bage... The center Linco... Zabar's... Papaya King.New York is the cultural and intellectual center of the planet. Hey, I know my neighbors! At the other end of the hall, there is... Clax... pa... I. I love this guy. New York has Greenwich Village. Sinatra. But that city he sings? This is not ""Secaucus, Secaucus."" I understand, OK? I see what you mean. I guess... we could live in Brooklyn. Hey, Lucy. What are you doing up? Sorry. Go back to sleep. Ok, I'll get your mom... Let's go. I moved here. Really. New Jersey wins. It's great. This is for what?"
854,4,3,voice ,"Let's be clear, when I say ""you"", I mean the interview.You have the interview. I do not want there to be confusion.You only maintenance. Not the job."
855,4,3,woman ,"We lived in Manhattan. All the time. It's been a while. Funny, not that we lack."
856,4,3,,"Ted (2030): During the fall of 2008, I had a little problem. Ted (2030): I lived in New York, but Stella was living across the river in New Jersey... Ted (2030):... So I took the train all the time. Ted (2030): So, it was always as if I missed any. Ted (2030): Children, your Aunt Robin was tired of his job, tired of lousy production... Ted (2030):... tired of the stories she had to announce. Ted (2030):... and most of all, fed up with stupid puns. Ted (2030): So, when she knew she was national presenter, she could finally say the words she longed to say for years. Ted (2030): This Saturday, when Robin left for his first day, we crossed the river to experience the amazing nightlife of New Jersey. She leaves home and takes Stella the bike that is on the porch. It is 10:31 p.m.. Marshall and Ted back. 10:47 p.m., Robin is the bike on the train. 10:56 p.m., Robin slalom between the cars. Ted (2030): Children, believe it or not, but Aunt Robin swears it happened like this... 10:59 p.m., Robin arrives at the studio of Metro New One."

All your stuff are idiots. Like everything else you bought the medieval festivals. Give me the stick. Let's go! Yes, what a moment of incredible human sincerity. Yes, it's been two weeks. This is an intervention. Oh my God. This is one of p'tain of pleasant surprise. This is about what? P'tain. We know, darling, you know. This is a brand new vest. Specifically, those with fire.

I will bake cookies to fill R2-plump. Oh, honey. What? So if we continued the evening up there? Forget it."
862,4,4,man ,This is an intervention.
863,4,4,marshall ,"I think it'll work. Moving is very moving. As you will not get bail, I thought you could pay me half. Because you've treated this apart as John Bonham treated his nervous system. Proof A. What is it? Encyclopedia? You know, it'll have you ""dia-pays"" for it. But you've ever done. Second, the evidence B. You're also responsible for damage to Robin when she was your girlfriend. Do you remember the time you got drunk the pack of beer and you've become Super Canadian? $ 20 if you manage to run it through the door. For America. It's true. We live. Two wonderful weeks... and oh yes, I will continue to wear it. I control. I can remove it whenever I want. And? No Stella. I just said ""No Stella."" It was perhaps for your hearing problems. It's getting serious. You see? We want him. We are all really happy for you. Even you, you will meet more girls in 22 years when you get 80. What challenge? I did not challenge. I would love to see it, but I've not challenged. Water has flowed under the bridge... ""Dear Ted, Stella seems to be wonderful. But you do not know enough to get married. You do not know probably not enough to get involved in raising a child with her. You do not restore her service or her child or yourself by throwing yourself like that. Just take a little longer. "" It was there for months, OK?That was before we know Stella and that way as she's great and what you train super torque. That's why we decided to not make this statement. And we're here. You know what? This may be because... when it's good, you know. Of course it does. My sensors indicate that your shortbread levels are dangerously low. I'm on it. Hey, man? Come here a minute. Know that this is quite normal. The major change can be frightening, and fear... it is one of them. So... why not you give me the knife? Give it to me. Go. That way I can unpack too. I will stay with you forever! We had a nice life here.That's why we rejected the package. Because unconsciously, we all know that it would be stupid to leave. It's safe and warm here. There is a downstairs bar, a robot cookie in the kitchen.This is my house and I never leave! I can not believe my father had read this letter at our wedding. Everybody says it's good to change, right? But it's what's good? Barney, it was not a gamble. Person... Okay, it matters not. Not at all. Yeah. That's enough, the trick of ""old."""
864,4,4,robin ,"Barney's crazy if he thinks it'll work. You have not finished? Why is it so long? Not me. The key? Discard tips and not looking back. I go to Japan. It took me half an hour. I could take 20 minutes, but a friend called me in tears. It will not work. Well, that's exactly the kind of crap to throw away. It's like love letters, directories or the ashes of people.They take up space. In addition, she will let you not keep half your mess. What damage did I do? Stanley Cup game six?

Frightened by the slightest change. Terrified by all that is new. Desperate to cling to your comfort zone. I can not go to Japan. What was I thinking? It's so far. I speak the language. I have not even good pictures of you. Why? It is French, it's like playing tennis without a net. Amazing. Wendy, you can take a picture? Barney is an intervention."
865,4,4,stewart ,What's going on? Thank you. This is the boost I need. I love you all. No.
866,4,4,ted ,"There he is. What are you doing? The best memories of our 20 years were held in it. It's not that throw stuff in a box. You look back at the past. But it is. Finally, everything changes. I will live with Stella, you will be in your new apartment. You start a new job in Tokyo. This is the end of an era. We should make a toast, but not with the usual shit. Your bottle of Scotch the most expensive. Excellent. A bottle of beer with it, and what do you think will cancel the Scotch? Look at this. A photo of the day we moved. So many good memories. So you keep a photograph? Why not? Like what? There is not enough drinks in the world that I drop my scourge. Wait, why I pay more? That's not true. An Encyclopedia ""World Book"" of 1986. It is with these that I grew up. Do you think we should say-die encyclo-pil. It's a common mistake. But if you look at the direction of the bar on the ""e"". The symbol of this encyclopedia, you'll know it is a diacritic which aims to change... Hello, good topics. Look what I won at the festival. Catch it, guys! Girls, stop! It's good enough! Barney's fault entirely. As fat burning on the mantelpiece, for that matter. About the hat. This is about the exaggerated English accent. It's weird. By removing the closet, I thought I saw the banner. And the flag was burned. Why new? And there are letters from you all, with ""Ted"" written on it. You prepare a response for me? That was why? The sandals? Hair products? My God, it was for Stella. What? You think I should not marry Stella. You think I should not marry. Obviously, it was not, it had agreed to make interventions more stupid to work on interventions. We made too many interventions. What was your biggest problem with me and Stella? Stella. You kept it on you? I want to hear the other letters. And if you changed yet? Go Lily, listen to yours. I can hear yours? You've already read the intervention on my pronunciation. Where is the letter of Stella? Come on. Thank you. Because I really need you to handle it. Of course not. It's not like what you said was nonsense.You you were worried. But you score a point. It all happened very quickly. I guess, but we are still at the stage where one seeks to know himself. And Lily, you may be right. Stella will not like my stuff. As the robot pot cake. This is the first thing we bought here, remember? My collection of James Bond. You know, we looked at them in order, and... Lily spoke with this weird English accent, until the next month? My cleats signed by Bernie Kosar. My lamp elephant.The English phone booth. My sombrero! I unpack. I never leave this apartment. I'm not ready for this responsibility, let alone to be the stepfather of a 7 year old daughter. If I get married and moved to the suburbs, in a twinkling, I exchange old! Hey. What? Who wants to go to the same old bar, sit at the same place and drink the same thing? The same thing! My favorite! Oh, my God! I am moving to New Jersey. And you should move into the new apartment, and Robin should go to Japan. Because it will age like it or not, then the real question is: do we want to go forward or clinging desperately to the past and end up like that? You know what? I take care of the warranty. It makes me happy, because every hole in this apartment is a memory I will never forget. But on one condition: you put all 10 tickets aside every week for next year and come back here and buy this tape 50 years of age, and a toast to the incredible year full of change that we had it. Remove from us. My new family and I, Marshall and Lily, in their apartment and Robin in a number of English-language journalists in the West Pacific, ending up here in New York to celebrate this day... The day we closed one chapter of our lives incredibly, to open a new one. Remove from here. So, let's raise our glasses of scotch at $ 2 500 for a year of hell. It's smoky, with hints of cedar and old... You see the difference between that and tape for $ 10? Good idea. I have the tape. I will get my problem."

No, I recognize a lost cause, when I see it. That's why I'm not recycle. In addition, Ted getting married, it is my interest. You know... I worked on an issue of utmost importance. I admit I was baffled. Until I decided to take the bull by the horns.(Barney written on a board: how to lie down again with Robin) Then, finally, I décryptais code. ""GIVE THE MARRIAGE OF TED. "" Let's hope. This weekend is my best chance to start with it. Lily, kidding. I want to look cutesy and romantic, but this weekend, Robin will be the only girl that I will draw. ""The Collective Namaste Yoga and Meditation."" You have anything like Scotch? I need alcohol. I'm not gonna do that stuff with Robin.Look at that. Berry cocktail, conditioner meninges. I dream, these drinks could make a girl smarter. What hell Ted brought us? What? No. Robin must come. Dude, Robin has to be there. What are you parl... Co-witness, I'll handle this. Robin, where are you? OK, in a few hours. Have a good flight. Bad news. I can not have it. Robin is gone. Yes. I'm here with someone. Dear wife, thank you for the interest you have for Barney Stinson... I regret to inform you that at this time... There are currently no positions available. I will not do, huh? Let's go to your room. Far from it. And can be the whistle. No problem. I just need to tidy up a little. Of clothes on the floor and... The towels in the bathroom, a real mess. So, give me 10 minutes... to restore order... The girl on reception."

874,4,5,lily ,"Hi. How are you? Yeah. Ted, in high school, his marriage was you, right? No ""You not married, Ted?"" No ""You're making a big mistake, Ted?"" Have you stopped the fight against marriage? So you come back to Robin. You'll never there. Too many opportunities. The first bridesmaid drunk, you'll have your head under the dress as a photographer of yesteryear. It's not really the place I imagined for the wedding of Ted. Honey, will see the dirty hippie to the reservation there, we, we'll take to drink. There's no alcohol. I do not care, why do such. OK, this would be weird without Robin. But not contradict the bride. You should be more delicate with Stella about Robin. The brides are very stressed before a wedding. Well, of course, I was under control. The florist told me that roses are medium pink pale pink that means. Medium pink pale! All're done. Our wedding hall uses a boiler instead of a forced air heating. This is the thing that concerned me. Why are we still married? Poor Stella must be the crazy one month in three days. You wait for the next crisis, the rules you, you're a hero.After, you dealt with on about Robin, but this time she will say yes. This is a bride. There will be another crisis. Great! What is it? You'll never get there. No chance."

Even worse, I'm 90% sure that this kind in which you spoke was the lead singer of Spin Doctors. I know. I understand something is ""no ex"". Why would we want that history failed to come see one successful?It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners World Series. It's embarrassing for everyone. It should not come. It's the right decision. Do not you remember? After a while, is that the waffle."

God, this steak is good. 4 days before and he fled with a consultant from Whole Foods? I do my make-up more for him. I do not shower more for him. I shave armpits more for him. Now, so close to the wedding... Got some bacon or something in the sauce. I love it. I would not be refunded. I will lose thousands of dollars. You are Barney? I heard you were a real b*st*rd, so listen. Tomorrow night, I want to do things so nasty and depraved that I forget that it was supposed to be my wedding. Bring her. This is the big day. You hydrate? Your back will look like a Jackson Pollock. I have been vegan for 2 years. I need meat. I am a teacher of Yoga. All positions are possible. Your room in 20 minutes. No preliminary. OK, let's go. Who's that?"

OK, I'll be there. I gotta go. Good evening. And I'm Robin Scherbatsky. The talks have been arrested in the Middle East. Despite a promising start in the final negotiations, the talks foundered on security. Your new husband dismounted me out three times a day. Driven by concerns about the environment and oil prices, sales of hybrid vehicles rose 11% over last year. Hello? I'm off to the airport. What did Ted this time? I understand. It's OK. Can you imagine not traveling I did. I was on a plane, a whole day. But it was worth it to see you get married.How I would have missed it... thank you God! It's weird. It's weird. You know how it feels to be one of the former married? Yes, but it's not that long ago. See you marry another woman is not really something I look forward to. I just thought if I changed my mind about marriage and children, it was nice knowing you were there. That's not it. It's just... Maybe so. I mean, of course it does. The kind of thing that leaves no one fell swoop. I'm not a guest over. I quit my job. I return to New York. I thought I wanted this job, but...Getting back to my real life. And you should go back to yours. You married. Listen, this is precipitated. It's as if you started a book by the end. You are the most romantic. You stole a blue horn for me. You tried to make rain. It was a coincidence. After all this is how your romantic quest comes to an end? You hide in the wedding of another in his house in his life, without thinking twice. This is not the end spectacular than you deserve. It's not Ted Mosby. Yes. You stop it. (Robin drinks the glass of a sudden) My God, so, stop. I spend a very bad day. I've stolen scotch at the duty free. It tells you? I have no room. In fact, I thought I could stay with you. And a girl naked, tied to your bed. In addition, Barney."

So every little detail on Shelter Island, the sun managed to sleep... I'll finish it. You know, she always wants to overtake. I like it, but there is a part of me that would like it all falls apart. You think about what? It might help. It's true. Recovering your marriage, we reimburse you all that you paid for. Ted and I are getting married Sunday. I've wasted years waiting for the father of Lucy decides to be ""ready"" for it, but it has ever been. That's why we had never married. Come on, must be spontaneous, I dreamed that Tony is spontaneous like that. The programs are great. It is not our names on it, but otherwise it looks nice. You're invited Robin? You gave me no warning. I'm not sure what to think. Yes, but it's your ex girlfriend. It's weird. It's weird. Not what you imagine is to see her boyfriend's ex marriage. When the former are present, I dunno, it brings back...things unresolved. Close with your ex, do you know that the flame will not turn back? Have you bet money against you in this quarrel? It's important to me. I would have never invited the father of Lucy. No, Tony is the last person I want to see here, OK? And Robin is the penultimate. My daughter, my daughter does not come to our wedding. Tony was the lead here tomorrow, but cash hurt my marriage, and he will not take him. It's been 5 years. Why not turn the page? Hi, my heart. You've missed. Just one second, OK?Tony invited you? At our wedding? This was discussed. No ex at our wedding. Why did you do that? What does Robin here? I thought I was clear. No ex at our wedding. You've invited! It's weird. It is as if it was not over between you. Tony and... I can not look after him. Will you tell him to leave? You can say it's my fault. I'll talk to Robin, she knows it's not personal. Your father has finally finished drooling? Who wants ice cream? Of course. Take that, bitch! I won! Have his former close... it reveals unresolved problems. With your ex not far, which tells you that the flame will not turn back? It's as if it was not over between you. I've wasted years waiting for the father of Lucy decides to be ""ready"" for it. I dreamed that Tony is spontaneous like that."
882,4,5,ted ,"Hi. It was just dinner with her sister Stella and her boyfriend.They married before us. It seems that the lamb is great here. Did you need protein. I take the lamb. New objective: Our marriage is to kick the ass of hers.Our marriage is to take the head of his, press it down the toilet and flush 20 times. Hard to know where is the problem. No, Stella, it should help. Pay for dinner. Do not worry.Taking Charge. We get married on Sunday? It is sure to be ready for this? I'm leaving. And I'm also... spontaneous. (He throws a glass of water on his face) I would not have done that. We need you to come, this is my marriage. This is my marriage. You gotta be there. It is. No time. Do we really have to rent the cars for tomorrow. Guys, Stella and I have a little problem. Actually, I spoke to Robin. It is a little late, but it will be there on time. Yes, of course. Can I help you? Are you happy. You like him. But no. Come on, we're friends. In addition, we already had our Thanksgiving last relapse, it is not old. She already has his ticket. It would not bother me. Tony is great. Invite him too. Robin will soon get on the plane. In addition, it unleashed a lot of work for that. What should I do? That's true, this is my best friend. Girl friend. My best friend girl. Aldrin Justice, the last word. I will not tell him to come. It's gonna be the worst phone call of all time. OK, Robin arrives. You know, I'm fine. The former should be able to go to weddings. I'll tell Stella to do with. What do you mean by ""delicate""? What do I do? And if there is no other crises? There is a new crisis. What? So, first thing tomorrow I'm going to talk to him, convince him to let me take Lucy, then boom, crisis solved. Stella is happy. Robin comes to marriage. We did a little karate? OK. Not yet. Soon. Actually, I've already had s*x many times. Why I always corrects people? Look, here's the thing... Tony, stop. It is also a great day for Lucy. You'll have to put your problems aside and think about what is best for her.Whether you like it or not, it really should be the wedding of his mother. I take Lucy with me. Let's cuddle. But you're part of. You are now. Let me talk to Stella first. To be fair... your ex is here. Come on, it's not weird. You can talk to Tony? Robin made the trip from Tokyo. I should talk to him. Sorry to have run away like that. You can not come to the wedding. What? It's not weird. It was broken, there is more than a year. So, I was your backup plan. It's flattering. Why do you mention that? There was nothing between us. It's true. We went out together, but... we have moved on.And we got what we wanted. I marry, You have the job of your dreams in Tokyo. And they lived happily... You what? What does that mean? I did the rain. I love Stella. This is good. If you feel it all... I think it is good that you come to the marriage."
883,4,5,tony ,"Sorry, sorry dude. You have my alarm activated defense. You must remember these things. Stay alert, rest life. What brings you here? I thought you'd be in a bridal suite with my wife. That's right, tonight is the big night. Oh, man, you gonna make love to the mother of my daughter. You and Stella. You're lucky. I could just... I am very happy for you. You can not take it. You're right, man. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just... You see all... made me realize what I had. I'm sorry. Lucy is everything to me. I will lose it with this family, I am not one. I have not been invited to the wedding. ""Road Trip"" OK? (They are on a boat) ""Road Trip 2, back in the car."" I get it. You see all... made me realize what I had."

885,4,5,,"Ted (2030): Children in a relationship, you develop as a telepathy with your partner. Ted (2030): Children, morality often happens at the end of the story, but this one is too important, I will say now: Never, never, invite ex to your wedding. If I was given this advice, it would have changed everything. Ted (2030): Robin was serious information. Ted (2030): It was the first English news channel in Japan. Of course, the info was a little different there. Ted (2030): And the day before the wedding, Stella and I made the trip to Shelter Island. With others not far away. Ted (2030): So the morning of my wedding, I made the way home Tony, to take Lucy. Ted (2030): The children, if I had left Stella talking to Robin, this story would have ended differently. Ted (2030): And now, how I met your mother. Ted (2030): But I have not done. Ted (2030): Children, sometimes you think you live a story, but the truth turns out to be quite different. (Robin is on board a boat, Ted is in his room and read a map and Stella is also on board) In those days, I thought it covered only the presence of Robin marriage. (Stella Tony covers his coat) If only I had understood what it was about. Ted (2030): Seriously, kids, do not invite your ex to your wedding."
886,4,6,barney ,"I watch this young man dancing near the jukebox, and I can not help thinking... Stella may have made the right choice. Ouch! Assumption. He is not pretending to be happy. Ted is really happy. He did not want to marry from the start. Ted had the best train dodge since Stand by Me Well, not the first kid, but others. Hey, kid. I did not know you'd be here. Girls stairwell. Guys, let him go. He is happy. Listen, if Ted was married, then he would be married, he would live in New Jersey, and he would be married. It is well. Good, let's eat. Let Flat Michael's? Okay, Ted, is there a place in Manhattan where one can dine? I will not in this table. Possibly, in this one. Where may well be nuts Ted? You should check the garage in the grip of Stella. Lily, you're all been there. When we loose one, it's not pretty. The kids are great. I am a person who... Well, are facing. There are a bunch of people I do not want to see... as the group of ""girls that I skipped""... but if one of them came here, I would stay there, and I would look into his eyes. For some, this would be the first time. Son of a bitch. Do you mind? Becca is this girl who lives in the North. I saw her from time to time. Bedford Hills Federal Penitentiary. And yes, the visits were of a conjugal nature. Really. And that I had with Becca was a perfect relationship. She was allowed to call me once a week. If it becomes too sticky, the armed guards stoppaient. I've never had to pay for dinner. In fact, this is false. I pay taxes. I guess we all paid for dinner. Thank you, guys. Anyway, at the last visit, I screwed up. I know it's hard, baby, but I'm in a prison too.Imprisoned in my heart. This room is ready or what? We can...? That's why I'm here, baby. I am your strength. I'm...Oh, my God. Hello, stranger. (He hangs up with the first woman prisoner and will talk to another who has just arrived) Barney Stinson, attorney. Let's talk about your output. Now I have letters from Becca who say, ""I'll come see you the day I get out of here. I'll hang your eyes in my rearview mirror. ""Women, eh? Boy, this sure is another table. What are we talking? Wait a second. Sorry, continues. My poor. Being forced to grow up in Canada with America, right next door. The blue line? It's hot. There, there. You can fly it into the lamp? Fasten your seat belts!Not you, Ted. Come on, Ted. She left you on the altar. I have ants in my leg! From cold blood."

888,4,6,father ,"You said the same about our rabbits. You remember how they were delicious? Guys, you have behaved splendidly there on the ice.Splendidly. You go outside. I come back with soft drinks and pretzels. What do you do? You are teammates, hockey players.Teammates do not kiss! Hockey players do not kiss! Oh, my God. I have no son."

891,4,6,lily ,"Ted, the wedding was yesterday. It's been 24 hours. No, it is a mess. A mess. And one must be there for him. Hey, man. Oh, the farm. I'm sorry, is that you have experienced something traumatic, and we try to be there for you, but do not you leave us, and it irritates us, selfish little whore. Sorry. Super. Thank you, Ted. Well, The Meatloaf Charlie? This is ridiculous. You can not live like this. Someone told me of a tapas bar located in the white zone. I actually remember it. Oh Oh! I remember. He is serious? You're maybe Ohio, but you live in New York now. We do not bury our emotions in New York. We take our emotions and they are sent to the other side! I dream! There's not one person on Earth to which I would hide under a table. How dare you pronounce this name to me? This is the last person I would like to see here. Michael purifier. This is a guy I was in high school. Michael was next to me in Biology. It was a failure for the entire college, but the summer before the third, he grew 30 cm and joined the baseball team. It was becoming a cool guy.Until one day... Are you kidding? It was the third. I had a choice. Oh, my God, purifier! It gauze? Of course purifier. Or rather Gazeur. Gazeur! The Gazeur nickname stuck. He had so much ridicule, he had to change schools. It made me always feel guilty. But if Gazeur... Michael...came now, as hard as it may be, I would go to Gazeur...Michael... and I should settle things between us. That's not true? Who is it? From Robin's father. Why? You do not think you'd feel better if you talked to him? You're gonna say what? Wait, wait! Where it goes? His taxi has missed the exit for the Lincoln Tunnel. She stops. OK, wait. Wait... Wait. Listen, Ted, it's great that you're angry... Okay, tell him that."
892,4,6,lucy ,Mom!
893,4,6,man ,"Come on, give me my son. Grows."
894,4,6,marshall ,"How can he dance here? He should be trying to smash the car with a club of Stella. Dude, you make some? We are concerned that you faced not what happened with Stella. Do you remember when Lily left me? How I buried my emotions? It... I... miss him so much. I should have been worse, OK? I should have my nerves, follow your advice and burn cases Lily. I have not done it, and that's why I took so long to get better. So Ted, I want you explode. Release your rage.Ready? Now! It leaves you on the altar, and it's you who're avoiding? It's that ""one"" small dicks? Oh, you laugh. She took to win. Will the yelling. Ted, this is ridiculous. We do not need. Stella is a party. It comes back. (They go back under the table) We all think that you need... Wait, where is Barney? (Barney is in the next table) We think you should talk to him. What? It's sad for your father, Robin, but congratulations for this game. Sorry. Well, well you do. You're going to confront it. You have to get angry. Go ahead. Looking good. Stella hated Star Wars. She lied to you. Seeking your feelings. You know it's true. No. The waiter asked him: ""Do you want covered? ""And she said:"" I'm going home. "" Finally. Finally, my friend. I know and I love it! It's great! Sir, we will pay gladly handle that has been broken. I love Ted angry! Lets get out, man, let out. Yes, Ted. Come on, buddy! What are you doing? Sure. It kills!"

896,4,6,robin ,"You wanna hang out? Yeah man, you've been a rock. Why? Ok, how about Hurley's? It's that thing? The sea is blue. What? She turns around. Who is Gazeur? You did what? Clearing the air, as before. Oh, man. It does not happen often. You are welcome. Who is Becca Delucci? Not me. If the last person I wanted to see, came in I would not talk to him. My father. I have not spoken to him in 3 years and I want to start now. It goes back to my birth. He wanted a son and the fact that I am a girl has not changed. My full name is Robin Charles Scherbatsky, Jr. And it only got worse. At 8, he took me hunting for the first time. I want to shoot a deer. But they're cute. My body started to change... It was increasingly hard for him to act as if I was a boy. The worst moment came in my 14 years. My junior hockey team had just won the ""Squamish Invitational."" And everybody came to my house to celebrate. You're an idiot. And Kyle and I are doing anything serious. It was only the blue line. You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that ""crease"" speaks for itself. After that, my relationship with my father has cooled. I moved with my mother, let my hair grow, was a Canadian pop star. Young normal stuff. That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what? ""I wish not to be raised as a boy, that thou teach me not to hunt, fish and smoke cigars and drinking scotch because girls do not do that. And you know why I run like a girl? Because I am one. "" Yes. This is so exciting. I understand! Why take it away to bring him back in New Jersey, anyway? Get rid of your demons!"
897,4,6,server ,Do you want covered? It's going guys? This is your almonds.
898,4,6,stella ,"No, I'm going home. Ted, wait. I know."
899,4,6,ted ,"It's funny when I think about it. I was sure that Stella was good. When she left me, I was so devastated. But you helped me overcome that. Now the hard part is over. I came out a little louder. You know, I do not think further of it. This is the work of time, I guess. I know. That's all I advance. A new chapter in my life begins today, and we'll celebrate. Here, we need two things.We need Kool and the Gang. It's time the jukebox! It gauze? Girls, I'm fine. I'm fine. Barney, I'm fine! It is not necessary, and it is rather unhealthy. Sorry, ladies. What do you want for dinner? It's OK. It is between the 44th and Lex. Impossible. It is near the gym Stella. We could cross. Everywhere else, it's going. Stack between his office and dry cleaner. Sorry. Two blocks from her mother's hairdresser. Of course. Look at this. A reference card I made. A guide to places where you can meet Stella Zinman. The red areas: to avoid. White: OK.Blue: the sea Yes, I avoid it. What is the problem? It goes like this. No, 'on', it is the people of the great state of Ohio. When life is hard, we take the pain and bury us. And if the pain goes, is buried pain over another. Why cope when you can avoid?All I have to do is to never see her again, and I will have a long happy life. So who wants to eat? Super. Let's go. Not yet. Can we have almonds to the table? Well done, Lily. This place looks cool. That you talked about? Oh my God! Oh my God! OK, stay cool. We'll just have to manage it. Everyone... follow me. Think, think. Guys, stay there. I'll take a look. Marshall will look. She looks happy? She talked about me? I do not care.Where are the almonds? Let me go. You'd do the same if you were in this situation. Really, not one? Not even... Gazeur? Let's just eat here, if possible. Thank you. You have a daily special? Really, you hide from anybody? Not even... Becca Delucci? Where exactly in the north, Barney? You see? Are you afraid of Becca. Lily is afraid of Gazeur. (Marshall head out from under the table) are still under the table. Oh, my God. That's it, and that's it, the style Ohio. The problem manifested itself. It has been avoided. It is a party.Here you can dine in peace... Really? How so? You kept it for quite some time, eh? It has returned to you. I'll talk to him. (They go out from under the table, but Stella is gone) She's gone. I'll catch up. There she is! I see. It is two taxis right front. Not lose it, OK? I will face it. Bluntly. I will say, ""Sorry it did not work. ""We will discuss in adults. She'll tell me his views and... I will listen. What I should have done more before. Come on. There is no question of moving his arms, stomping feet and get angry. This is Stella and I finally communicating. Clearly, it was... That's his problem. In the name of all that is sacred... Maybe she goes to his office. If she goes to her, why you go to...? Oh, my God. Tony lives in the city center. ""At home"" is Tony's apartment. She would move in with me in New Jersey and moved to town, Tony? The bitch! I have the balls too! Me too! That's it. That's it! I know exactly what I say. (Ted comes out of the taxi) You chose the wrong guy. You chose the wrong guy. You did a very, very, very bad choice. What were you thinking? This guy? You kidding me? Have you learned anything these past 8 years? You'll be sorry. You know it? You'll be sorry, and you can do anything about it because it is too late. Anything you can do is start up your life miserable and disappointing that will never be as happy as it could be with me. Goodbye. Look, I'm not there to pick you. I am here because I need to know that you know you've made the worst mistake of your life. Okay. (Ted is still in the taxi) This is what I say."
900,4,6,waiter ,Have you decided? Certainly.
901,4,6,woman ,"You're the only thing that kept me here. Hell, no!"
902,4,6,,"Ted (2030): Children, on your wedding day should be the happiest of your life, the culmination of a perfect love story. My marriage, at least the first has not gone so well. Ted (2030): But all my friends wanted to be there for me, I would, seemingly, well. Ted (2030): Finally, after two weeks, emotions eventually overflow. Ted (2030): And I realized... all my friends were haunted, but there was a difference between my and their ghosts. It was not too late for me. Lily:... and that you face all that, but... you only have one chance. Take a moment and think about what you will say. Ted (2030): So I got out of the cab, ready to tell her everything, ready to explode but then... Ted (2030): Here we go at once. And it was over. At this point, I was not angry. I saw that she was made to be with him.Children, you might think that the only choices are to swallow his anger, or swing at someone. There is another option: you can let it flow, and when you do that, we can forget and move forward. And that was the perfect ending to a perfect love story.It was just not mine. Mine was always there, waiting for me."

Are we ready, Marshall and me to have a baby? So, are we ready to have a baby or not? Marshall is really excited. But I think he sees only the good sides of it. The other day while playing with the little Jeremy, I was talking with his mother. I will be as carbon copy Charlotte. Worse. At least, her husband works at home. Well, he deale of shit, but it is a caring father. Marshall is always at work, and I'm afraid to hit all the work if we have one now. Well, that's perfect. That's why I called you.

I do not either. I dream, it has been lost. That's good that we have broken. I had totally forgotten your psychosis on the kids. God thank you, you're not my mother. You're an ice queen. All you have breastfed baby by a frozen brain. You're in good company there. Okay. When you have finished, you could ask a magician to heart. No argument. Super. Your cell phone rang. I answered.

916,4,8,barney ,"I want to take this moment. The last time you and I are just competing for the title of best friend Ted. Exactly. Draw. But it's all about to change. Is it correct that you are an architect? You draw what now? I think you'll love what's happened at work. That was my first question. Who's going to draw? I know. ""We're Swedish. It's so cool with our baguettes and our Eiffel Tower. "" It's France. No matter, I told Bilson... Bislon, saving your... No, I get up, and I told Bilson... Bislon, saving your... Music. Imagine a patriotic music. Bilson, with all due respect... it would be terrible if a job that would suit American architects was relevant to a band of French. Where is our patriotism? Love of country? Our love of all that... Yes. I know a great American architect who would be perfect. Ted Mosby. All you have to do is come and offer your drawing, I take care of the Board, the project is yours. It's not the best. We three, we'll work together. Yes, totally. It works like this: one of us goes into the office the other and said... Marshall, the teleconference begins soon. And then you go up on the roof... and drink beer. Basically, it is of ""Mad Men."" I'll spank a secretary. What series? And then you throw the bodies of cans at pigeons. I will realize your dream. Ted, it's incredible. Detail. Shadows. The liveliness of the lines. This is exactly what Princess Leia would look like, topless. No, that's fine. Lily Aldrin, little secretive. For years, I say that our gang needs a Woo, and thou hast hid me in a whole herd. Attention Lily. The world badly needs the Woos. If there were not Woos, there would not Girls Gone Wild, no bachelor party girl, no pool bar in Las Vegas... all the things you hold dear would not exist. Industry shooters memories would collapse. Just like the glitter body and that of Hummer limos. The mini cowboy hats would be worn by the little cowboys. And when ""Brown Eyed Girl"" happen on a jukebox, you do not hear... that silence. And ""Brown Eyed Girl."" But who would Woo, Lily?Who would woo? Would you? You'd... Woo? Well you'll excuse me, I have a date with Bataille and Fontaine. You did not have. The Board... Sven decided to choose. I've done everything to change their minds. But they did not budge. I'm sorry. Finish Your Beer. Fill the machine. It's okay. All withdrawals at ATMs are free. Good grief. I told Heather to put everything back as it was on your desk. Okay. So? It looks like we had our man. I not think there need to see... Oh, my God. It's me! I've never known so far, but I've always wanted. What does this button? It's building the coolest of the universe. It could not be more awesome. It's not my office. The building was well Ted. That of Sven was better. And I will not let the fact that I am the best friend of Ted influence business. It's a lie! I chose it because it... He breathes fire, Marshall. I have not even paid attention. I never made a career choice by selfishness. I am a professional. Go. Spend a good day, drunk, and throw the bodies of the pigeons. Like what? That's great, Sven. You are so much cooler than Marshall. He has not even mix. Who wants a foam? It's the call. Got it? In America, when we work late, you lie on a conference call, and here we ascend a few beers. It's great. It turned Sven. Those guys were morons. Of course, they had cool ideas... really cool ideas. In fact, I wonder if it's not too late...The fact is: you have the job. The committee realized he had erred. In addition, you are precious to them and they want you to be happy. Your plans were the best and you deserve it. You should know one thing that you did not get the job early. You see, Ted... You know... Why you helped me? You are truly the best friend Ted. And me too. Tie.Thank you, Marshall. Me too, buddy. No, even if you pay me. I have an inner ear problem. That's right, girls."

I swear, at school, Jillian is not so Woo. No thank you... drag ignorant. You do not need a Woo. Nobody needs it. None of this stuff... Ted did not get the job. But this is not the biggest disappointment of the day. You were seen to Woo. You who did Woo? Oh, yes. Your nose is growing. You've become best friends with Jillian now? Like what? I can Woo. But if. Wooo! The same things are funny as singles. I had no cowboy hat, and it was the day of fire safety at school... My God, ***** s. This is our theme. LL Cool J stuff always comes out? You are a bunch of prostitutes. You must have STDs. I get it. Because I am happily married, I'm a schmuck? You say that to make me feel not like an old married. The poor girls... and Ted.

Listen to this. Lily sent me a text message. It was at this bar, The Giddy Ups with full of Woos. You want to go to the current GNB building and just... I dunno, just a little pee on it? Bilson? I just wanna say, I know that you chose Sven, but... Ted Mosby is extremely talented, and... he would have made a hell of a job. Teleconference. Now. You wanna tell me something? Bilson told me he wanted to give the job to Ted.What has happened? What is your problem? This is the big break of Ted!You have betrayed to work in the brain of a Tyrannosaurus, which, incidentally, if you knew the dinosaurs is very, very small. You have not chosen one of Sven because he was better. You wanted an office dinosaur. ""Fire Marshall"". How could you do that to Ted after all that happened with Stella? You are an egoist. No. For two reasons. A, pigeons are smarter than you think. They are resentful. And two, it's our last conference call, Mr. Stinson. There are repercussions to ride a friend. Because, that. You have tested those purple shots in test tubes? I took five. I believe that there is no alcohol in it. What hat? It was Bilson. Bilson wanted to have a head office in the dinosaur, Barney convinced him that it was really, really stupid. You did the right thing. You got a well deserved boost. And then it would have disappointed Ted, and it is finally... very happy for the moment."

I have never heard of this before Jillian, and suddenly, it's your best friend. You do not stop talking about her. Yeah, but Marshall is still there. There was not much time to talk, just us two. This is where the story gets really good. So it goes... I wish we had time for girls. I love Marshall, but I am not free to express myself. OK, but I want to stay too late because... (Marshall and Ted joined them at the table) Do you remember... this thing last month after going there? You know who said it was going, but she gave me tips. That's great! No one. Your friend has a birthday here? She has what, 19? It was not like a Woo. Perhaps it is that holidays like Mardi Gras and the day of the year. Maybe this is a cyclical Woo. So, Jillian, it seems that when you not flash the bartenders, you are mistress of CE1. How is it? It's been what? What? Given that, do Woo? I have not done Woo. That's not true. It's just... You're married, I'm still single. Whenever I'm with you, I'm usually the 3rd wheel. Sometimes it's nice to go out with other singles and doing stuff you do not. As to Woo, Lily. As to Woo. That's not true. It's not you, that. Someone won a trip buttocks until the first dance floor of the canyon of spanking! What are you doing here? That's what the fireman's helmet? Really? Who sings that? Lily, it does not work. You should not be there. On the contrary. Why do you think the Woo Woos have to when they win a drinking game? Or when a guy takes off his g*n t-shirt? Because that's all that life brings. These are...People really sad. And when she go out with someone who has it all, someone like you, it's disappointing. It takes them Woo. Look at those girls. Look at them and listen to what they mean Woo. Right now I am like them. I have no job, no boyfriend, I'm confused. So... occasionally, I need to Woo, but when I need to talk about something concrete, it is to you I turn. You're my best friend."

Woo is a kind of a young woman, who, like the cuckoo and the nightingale, takes its name from its singular it produces. Also, a Woo can be triggered in different ways. On one particular song on the jukebox... Ted (2030):... to a cheap shooter. On a ride on a mechanical bull... up, everything and anything. Ted (2030): The weeks that followed, I immersed myself in work. It was great to be on a project I really wanted to heart.Finally, the morning of the presentation arrived. Ted (2030): I came out pretty confident about my chances.That evening I met Barney. Ted:... will radiate power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen.

You're not the only one who provided e ""Dude-haired."" Pretty! What made you ask? My God! Guys, guys! That's him! This is ""The guy naked""! Wait, Mitch, I have to thank you. We all tried ""The guy naked,"" tonight. I want you to know tonight, as crazy as it was, took me out of my shell. A toast... Mitch. The sum of its parts makes him a man.But when it serves its parts, it becomes much more. It does not fit the definition of a hero, but he is the one I needed. The hero who helped me get over the disaster of the failure of my marriage and I was almost back in the saddle. He lives in the shadows. Is this a dream? The truth? A fiction? Damnation?Salvation? It is all that and also, no nothing. Because it is...""The guy with hair."""
939,4,9,vicky ,"Yes. Oh, my God! Ted, you're so funny! And I can tell you that you have beautiful eyes. Well done, hothead. Stop! Go and tell the director he owes us an entry. One of those with shrimp! Nothing. You were saying? And then his cane missed the last step and fell, while, I swear, at least 2 minutes. God, I love old. Thank you, from you, it's a real compliment. I love you to be an architect, it's fascinating. I could listen to you talk about design structures all night. And that's it. Yeah, this book is a shit. An idiot with whom I left it out there. This is in Mexico. (She returns to the kitchen) You know who writes good poems? Jewel. She has rotten teeth and she lives in a car. It has stuff to tell."

941,4,9,,"Ted (2030): Children, it is believed all know how long it takes to recover from a breakup. Ted (2030): But you're beginning to recover when you meet the person who puts you in the game. This is the story of how I met this person. (Ted takes the elevator with a woman. She goes out and Ted is in the elevator) Children, if you go swimming, you immerse them directly. (Another, he finds himself again in the elevator with the woman) First, you dip your toe in the water. Ted (2030): You take the temperature, to get an impression. Ted (2030): And you come back gently into the water. Ted (2030): Or, you know, the b*mb. Ted (2030): Children, I saw a bunch of crazy stuff on entering the apartment all these years. Ted (2030): But one of the craziest things I saw happened when I was a roommate with your Aunt Robin. Ted (2030): That night we all had something to prove. Robin wanted to defend his honor. Ted (2030): Lily needed to prove she could finish his list. Ted (2030): I had to prove that as scary as it may be out, Stella and I had forgotten I was ready to return. (Barney from the bar with a woman) And Barney had to prove that he too could be ""The guy naked."" Ted (2030): This is where I saw, lying on the table, a book of love poems by Pablo Neruda. The same issue I had in college. And the bookmark was my favorite poem. Maybe I was wrong about this girl. It was perhaps a future."

Except with a lightsaber, but that's in for 3 or 5 years... I'm on the forums every day. In 3-5 Thanksgiving, I découperai turkey with my saber green. Listen to me, trust me, I fought hard. There is no pride to be learned. My brothers. That's the monster of guilis! Wait! Go! Go! Cocoa break. So you fought. Seriously. Why should I pay? You know what, Doug? I will gladly pay.

You should have thought before beating them. No what? I knew it! You have not even given a single shot. Who's the wimp now? Answer: you. You know the old saying: ""If you can not assume, do not pretend to have done, do not laugh and refuses glasses blackjack and not defend your friend, who, coincidentally, lived full of fights with his brothers.

It has made us laugh. Poilade good, actually. I said that you did manicure every month. And you played the harp in the dance club of the pre-reform in college. Sure. We were all agreed that it was a guy who had beaten and that you had nothing to do with it... Affirmative. It's true. They have nothing to do with it. Look at them. Look at him. It would not 5 minutes in combat. It is as limp as spaghetti. No. Ca Apparently, Uncle Marshall and his brothers did more than fight. It's so good to be home. Mom, Lily, good job.

957,4,10,robin ,"What? That's not true. No, I say there are plenty of legitimate reasons to fight, it is perhaps not beautiful, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. No, it's true! I love it! I have a culture of hockey. If a guy is a fighter, it is rather sexy. And scars, seriously! If a guy has one, it has a Robin. And if he lost a tooth, I lose my panties. Just look at that eye. You look like a bad boy. I did not know you had it in me. You. That you had it in you. My God, it's hot! Tips to captain the football team because he gave you his ring and you were so cute in your evening gown? Barney? I was looking for you. I have tickets for the hockey game tonight. It's stupid.

Marshall looks like. He lost weight?"
958,4,10,ted ,"Thank you. Can I see the menu? We'll have to go elsewhere. In this bar, I will always be the guy left at the altar. It sucks! We lost Barney. He understood, there is little time, he could hold a conversation with just the titles of sitcoms ""black"" of the 70s and 80s. It is not play ""You know Ted."" What? No, sir. Not at all. What? Some guys are sitting at our table. But you know, it's good. Our help? Sorry, you just said... He wants to be fought? As with our hands and stuff? A fight. We gotta go? Yes, I forgot. She is sexy fights. We should go. There is an explanation very simp... Today we are going to braid friendship bracelets. I'm going. With which you fought? Break cocoa. OK, it's time to fight. Oh yeah? I seem to remember that this guy was well dumped by his girlfriend for a Taekwondo teacher. It might sound crazy, but... I need that. I think it's an experience I do. I go there. ""We""? No, you did. There was nothing we. He thinks he fought with him. Come on man, no one will believe we fought, we look at. What are you doing? What? To go home? You hit me in the nose! Yes, I cry!

He's not here tonight. Yes. That's... What is it? Assault! They continue to attack us! I can not go to jail! I could read a bunch of books, writing short stories. Drag me all the time.

You're at least they said we were one of the best medieval music group of the academy? Wait, so... they attack Doug. The angry, irrational, violent Doug, who now knows, you pushed under a bus. Look, you do not understand, you beat these guys all by yourself. Yes, look at me! I could hold at least 5... Yes, spaghetti with meatballs... Mate it. Look! A fight was not a good idea, actually. And that's my story. I learned that it is not right to fight and must never do. Damn!"
959,4,10,wendy ,"Cranberry Vodka, gin and tonic. Scotch and soda. Ted, I'll get you a menu... but I promise I will return."
960,4,10,woman 1, So you've just beaten?
961,4,10,woman 2," But I do not understand, what they did to deserve this?"
962,4,10,,"Ted (2030): Why do they fight? What is it hidden in us that drives us to settle disagreements with our fists? (In Lily's class, two boys fight) Whatever it is, this is from the beginning. Ted (2030): Children, I fought just once in my life. And that's how it happened. You know I have recently been abandoned at the altar. And the worst when it comes to us, apart from being abandoned at the altar, is what happens after. A steady stream, persistent and unbearable pity. Ted (2030): I spoke to Doug, children? Not? Well... Ted (2030): Doug Martin was in McClaren's bartender. He was always in the corner. Ted (2030): There are three things to know about Doug. The first is that Doug is a bit violent. Doug:... collapsed, so he's down. And it hits him! He made this face, trembling. What we did is that we left it there. I ressers? Ted (2030): The second is that he was weird about her hair... Ted (2030): But the third is that he was very faithful with its regulars. Ted (2030): Maybe a little too faithful. Ted (2030): So that's Doug. Ted (2030): I was 30. And of those 30 years, I was struck once. Ted (2030): There was this thing in colo. Ted (2030): In college, I studied Kung-Fu. And some other stuff. For the goat, it would be a few months after. Ted (2030): The idea is that I had never beaten. Barney:... no one sits at our table. Ted (2030): In fact, he knew they risked a small community service, surely no criminal charges. But he was furious against us. Ted (2030): And here, children, the only fight I've ever had.What can I say? For starters, a punch to the face, it hurts...very badly. And what hurts more? Ca (Doug gives him a punch too) All I remember is waking up. Ted (2030): I have not told them what had really happened. Ted (2030): Children, I would tell you that fighting is malet need to do it, but it's useless. So I tell you this: do you ever fight with Uncle Marshall. It's a big tared."
963,4,11,all ,Marshall! Robin! Drink! Holy shit! Holy shit! Everyone comes to play. Take all your worries. (Robin puts on a mask) Let's go to the mall. Today!

If I could see her naked. If I could see her naked. And fours. Ted has a little sister who is so playful every day. And if I meet with her breasts, I will play! Little sister, Little Sister!What? I can also celebrate Hanukkah. Hi. What are you doing tonight? Why, hello. I was expecting you. I needed one that rotates. Can I talk to one second in the kitchen? Not touch the chair. I praise him. I can not believe that thou hast hid thy sister all these years. First, I'm flattered. Then it's just jokes. A friend can joke on a friend's sister. Does not mean I'm going to act. You do not trust me? Okay. All right. I'll just... take my chair and leave. I have already called to add a person. No, nothing really... I'll take the vichyssoise with a hint of cream. Dairy ballonnent me. It, it means he will not. You do not have any illusions. There he just says the obvious. Exactly. Do you need relationships. If only Ted knew someone who works at, say... Goliath National Bank, then...expect. What? I work for Goliath National Bank. Incredible! Before you say or do something, give me a favor. Move away. It's a Prada. I think your prospects are good for GNB. U you have shown me that you can take any position. I hope you get the job. Nothing makes me happier than to fill an opening. You've sneaked? Oh yeah? You see, Ted, you have so little faith in me and Heather... And as we can count on Lily to sneak. Ted, you know, I'm not a saint. And yes, it is true that the times I drove your mother at the airport, say that there has been a... sexually confused and confusing time in the parking lot, but I said I draguerai not your sister, and I thought. You should have me believe. Your mother and I, we kissed."
965,4,11,heather ,"It's nice to see you. I took your room. Did you know you see the room of Miss Gottwald opposite? Ted, it was 62 years. Incredibly gay. (They return to the apartment) Dude, quail out there. So... I found an apartment today. Yes. And I hoped you would have drunk a little more wine hand side before you to ask you this, but... I need you to lease the instructions. I really need your help. What's the matter? You do not trust me? Listen, Ted, I want to get into finance, but... you see me like I was four and I wanted to become an astronaut. Very nice, this briefcase. I intend to pay it, Ted. I love this kit, but I can not afford. You were right, Ted. I'm ready to bend over backwards. Barney and I, we did nothing. Because you deserve it. You're so convinced that I am still a teenager out of control, you forgot that I grew up. I'll find a hotel. I will take my business later. Merry Christmas. I do not need you. You've signed the lease. Because you trust me and that's a good idea? Thank you."
966,4,11,lily ,"Go. It's not like that. Great news. Since that time Heather happening in New York, Ted has never left the Barney show. Do not tell me anything! You know I can not keep secrets if it's almost Christmas! Robin offers you an iPod! It ripens, just as you see it yet. Ted, many women have a period kleptomaniac. And yes, maybe sometimes they happen to mow a small object because it excites them in a strange way they are not explained. But... If it reassures you, I will accompany them to GNB, tomorrow. I will say that I'm going to lunch with Marshall, but in fact I espionnerai. And I espionnerai. And shit! Not enough! I have a secret. No! It has not happened. It happened something. Nothing. After the interview Heather, I went to see Marshall one time, when I came back... My God! What? I'm really sorry. You will say nothing. Ted, Heather begged me not to tell you. She hate me if she knows that I sneaked. You see? She has not bought the briefcase! It is responsible! And no chance that she slept with someone here.She turns the page. This is the new coasters? I swear, these coasters are thicker. You know what? It's a new batch of old coasters. I will confirm with the bartender. My God!"

968,4,11,male 2," It's weird, but is a reassuring side to be worn like that."
969,4,11,man ,"How are you, Marshall? I played hockey today. I hurt my knee. I poured beer on it. I miss the game of the Vikings.Minnesota! Okay. It's been two beers and Bemidji... who ordered the mini burgers? Damn! ""Son""? Nice story. ""Host""? Are you Canadian? If you want to imitate a Canadian, just turn off the light and act as if you were afraid! Sorry. I had not seen. Are you okay? OK, I apologize. Take a donut, it's a gift. The following comes from Ontario: Marshall Eriksen."

973,4,11,marshall ,"Hi. It looks like a spring day in Minnesota, there was no q'il all the taxis, the skyscrapers and the blacks. Not if Prince is on tour. Hi everyone. This is Robin. Turn drink. And you? Hey, man! You got anything in the leg? Go. You're wrong. Oh, yeah? I have the best score. Without boasting, I caught... a pike of almost 1 m. The biggest fish virtual nobody has ever taken. Finally... freshwater. The match. The Vikings were 2 minutes to go to the Super Bowl, when our striker, who had not missed a year's messed up a penalty and we lost in overtime. Damn! Yes. My father, I had never seen him cry in my life, wiped away a tear. He said... ""A small part of me just died, son. "" Do not let... anyone here know that you're not from Minnesota. Hi everyone! I said, good evening everyone! Beautiful story! But it seems a bit familiar. I see what you do. I've brought here because... I was sorry for you. And there, it looks like you're trying to steal my bar. With the nearby Canada, Minnesota, we like to make jokes on your back and they are often on the same theme. Yes. For example, everyone, how many Canadians does it take to change a lightbulb? ""What? No, the bulb is dead? I'm afraid! "" Where do prejudices? A stereotype appears, and suddenly, it spreads like fire. Asians misbehave, the Scots are stingy, the Brazilians are too many stamps. I doubt it works.You can not hang out with people who belittle your beloved country. I take you back. Please, no scene. You can catch two fish with a hook. It is Canadian! Robin is Canadian! She is Canadian.It comes not from Bemidji and she knows bugger all about the Vikings. During the 1999 NFC Championship, when the Vikings lost... Gary Anderson. He is retired. It was a case of fly fishing... in Canada. Sorry about what happened inside. I was stupid. I should say anything. But if. We love you all. If you ever leave again in Canada, we jump on a plane, you are pursuing, and after that Barney has dragged some of the club with which you have spoken, we will bring you here where you are supposed to be. This is not New York without Robin Scherbatsky. Yeah. I was hoping that you say that. Just like home, eh? OK. You come home in him, he apologized and you file a donut free? Sorry! All is well! Sorry. I think you will recognize. I will throw your body anyway. I will throw your body into Canada Day! Dude, you can split the screen. We know the words."
974,4,11,robin ,"Hi! I'm Canadian. No need to coat. This kind of weather does not scare me. And? You went to the hospital? I love the guys here. This is real guys. Without shampoo or manicure. The guys from New York are 10% chick. My God! This is Fisherman's Quest? I played all the time FQ at the time! I'll take my hat fisherman. Thank you for bringing me here. This is mine. ""I drink to forget the 1999 NFC Championship""? I love the passion you have for your Vikings. It's like looking for hockey in Canada... What? Why? They will do anything q'ils learn that I am... Bemidji. Bemidji, Minnesota. Go Vikes! So my father and I were in the NFC championship game by 99. And when we missed the penalty and lost... Holy shit! f*cking. My father that I had never seen him cry in my life, wiped away a tear and said, ""A small part of me just died, son. "" That's what I tell my son. If I am fortunate to have a son, I will call Rashad Tarkenton. I know! They all bought into. What? You think I'm trying to steal your bar? Host. No, I... What was that? As fear of the dark? This is stupid. Why do you think Canadians are afraid of the dark? No, wait. I have something to say. Everyone. Let me tell you something about Canadians. Why Canadians are not of birthday wishes? Because they are too afraid to put out the candles. My God, I love this place! No, but I can catch a fish and use this one to catch the other. Rashad Tarkenton. You know what? I'm glad you know it because I am proud to be Canadian. It was not a good NFL team or Prince, but we invented Trivial Pursuit. Anything, the Earth! In addition, in Canada, you can go to a strip club full of alcohol and order. And yeah. Moosejaw in the Bay of Fundy, you can whistle your pint of Pilsner while watching a minor girl to get naked. Jealous? In Canada, people do not care where you come from, as you are whisked away nice and possibly a cigarette, or when a donut. I am proud to come from the ""Great White North""... and I want to be right now. And was not afraid of the dark. Finally, we do not really like, but like everyone else. I'm sorry. That was your cue. I should not have my own.But every year during the holidays, I am homesick. And so far, every year, I had a reason to stay: a boyfriend, a job or something. But... This year, for the first time, I have nothing. What? Thank you. I miss sometimes. I wish I could close my eyes and find myself one hour in Canada. How did you find this place? There's only one way to know. It's OK. thank you. It's like home. No one likes the dark. You were a member? You sing what?"

That's the history of Heather. It has been six years and three high schools for his baccalaureate. She took the opportunity to ruin two cars, being married for five days, and spent nine weeks in a tree only to find that no one intended to k*ll him. And there, Heather said she moved to New York. It will not come out. Remember when she talked of going to college here? And then the day of admission... Where are my TV and my couch? Nothing but the TV is 2000 balls. Wait. Where are you? Damn. This is Barney. I never will. Every year, when the greeting card of Mosby happens... It's still him. I should answer. Hello, Barney. We go to Marshall and Lily get a full Kathy Bates, Misery exception. Want to go? He hung up. Hi kid. It looks to go. How are things at home? I know. She looks good? Answer. One second. It is not our chair. You've made yourself? How did you know that Heather was coming? Really? You're like ""Weird Al"" Yankovic to write that song on how to jump my sister.

You really can not tell Lily. Really? Let me think. We'll talk later, OK? You're my sister. I just think you have no idea of the difficulty of succeeding in New York. It's not a good idea. Heather and Barney alone in his office? And I do not want to be guarantor for the lease. It is about a girl who got caught for stealing, eight months ago. It suits me. Good luck tomorrow at the GNB. I'm sure you will impress them. Very friendly, the security camera, too. And there is one another. And a security guard. Yes. You got the job yet. Must push the door, not pull.And that's it. Thank you for having watched yesterday. Maybe I was wrong. She seems to have been able to manage with Barney. It will perhaps manage New York. Why? It's been what? I knew it. I've always known. It remained the same trail irresponsible. And when I see Barney... And how! OK, enough! I can not believe you hast slept with my sister! And you, you're mature and responsible?It's responsible adult to go to your first interview in New York and banging a stranger? You've always been immature and irresponsible. You'll always be immature and irresponsible.And I cosignerai not a subscription with you, let alone a lease. Come on. Lily saw you. What? Why do this? Merry Christmas. Look into it.

Barney, admit it. You always have feelings for Robin and it tortures you. You must learn to express your feelings. Perhaps you should see a psychiatrist. I entered. It was always like that. You remember, in law? The bank statement arrived today. You have booked a hotel two blocks from your school, a Tuesday. It's that, Marshall? What's her name? Barney, it's crazy. No, it's wrong. You must learn to get it out. As we did in my kindergarten class. ""The time for emotions"", every Tuesday morning. That's not how it is written. I warned you. When ex relapse, ultimately, it hurts someone. But nobody is listening. This is the story of my life.My nice face that prevents people listen to my message. What is your problem? Get out of here.

I was working and I had to take a leap here...reading this magazine. In... the room there. Well, Robin. Nobody likes reading a magazine at work. You leave your office holding a magazine... You have to read a magazine. That's why there has magazines. Exactly. And the worst part is, this piece of my hallway door to the toilet. It's exposure to criticism. It was my head. The boss. Anyway, I'd rather do it here. No, certainly not. Reminds me of a bargain between three parties where no one would discuss a certain event happened. An event... persuasion.

Do you have any? Wait. Maybe she has not found it weird. Sold. That was the case. Everything was going well. I felt more and more comfortable, more confident. I could conquer the world. One morning I'm in the eighth with a magazine. The celebrities extend their clothes? I also extend my machine. (The man breaks the wall of the toilet where Marshall is located) Do not enter! It did not last long. I just... reading a magazine. Here at work. It's the funniest thing. I was on the net, looking at hotels when I realized something. This is stupid. I decided it was time to face my complex and do what I had to do and once that decision, everything changed.

Yes, of course. I know. It's like riding a bike, man? Sold. Why are you here anyway? If this is a problem. You've done all the way here to read a magazine? I am willing to bet that there is a place to read this magazine at work. You know, a room with a little man on the door? Have you thought about maybe not reading a magazine when you read a magazine? No, I'm sorry. This is our house now. Marshall, you should also read a magazine. Give me your key. It seems more important than it is. We will not get there, OK? Nobody will get hurt. It has established rules. This is like telling Fonzie be cool. You can do it watching TV! As folding laundry. Yes, not that one. And now they sleep together, we argue more. Yes. Thank you, Barney. You were right. Peace was established. More than once. Last night we did when I answered the phone. Look, it's a private thing between me and Ted. It is not even discuss it if Marshall could read a magazine at work. Have you booked a hotel room just to read a magazine? We can make love. Hello. Sure, it was a good one. Personal memo: leave it lying around the pizza box more often. It was weird. Bizarre, weird, weird. B-I-R-A-Z-R-E.Bizarre. Come on, Lily. Do not your Ted. What do I do? I think we should stop sleeping. Ted and I, it's like cigarettes. You take one into thinking it is good. And very quickly, you buy one carton per week. I must stop it. So, you stop that, huh? This is for the best. It was fun, but I do not want it becoming weird. Colocs? Sold. Dude! Actually, what you did not care for us? I thought you had the perfect plan. I go step-louse. If you are looking for Ted, he was released. And... our little arrangement is... completed, by the way. Epousvantable? He insisted. He said ""no longer able to do"" if ""it hurt someone."" I think we all know who he is talking about. It's not obvious? Yes. This is Ted. You know how it romantic. He can not separate the physical emotion. It is kind of... Right. It's not like you, you know? In addition, we are friends. I want to complicate matters by committing. Hanging out with friends never works. So... you want to go eat a taco? You love them, right?

Last night, Robin left a pizza box lying on the floor, so we had s*x three times. And this morning before leaving for work... we kissed. What? This kiss has violated the spirit of our arrangement.

We'll be buried under the snow, that's what will happen. Robin, I'm sorry. You're not a robot. If you are, you are a very advanced model, and the human race has no chance. You did not choose to show your love through rituals tacky, and that's good. But maybe we did that because we have always done and we know no other way. What I know is that if there sitting alone at the airport, I have to go get her.These are the rules. I know not how you thought I draguais you, but... Where is she? What? She would have called me and... It not return until Thursday. It was all the way here and not return until Thursday. I feel stupid. Listen, they say nothing to Lily about everything, OK? Especially the part where thou dredges. That's it. The whole thing was a sign. Let us end this ancient ritual. I will not get it. Dude, that was weird. Really. Yes, really.

The bar is open! Who wants a beer? There's no sink. And you get out of the kitchen. Hold a bar, it sucks. Is closed. We said no last drink. We must do. We can do one thing. Caring for a bar, it's boring. We should stick to what we know. Of course! Why was not yet formed a band? Dude, I do not believe that you've ever done this far.You'll have to go back and redo all that way again tomorrow. Robin you really dredged? You're not really looking for it?

Ted (2030): To find out what it meant to have the keys to the bar, I must revert back to the night when I released five little words that everyone says at one point in his life. Ted (2030): Like all stupid sentences of five words that every man in her life said... Ted (2030):... we would regret it. We knew not yet. Ted (2030): It was then that Uncle Barney and I had a telepathic conversation. Marshall at the office: I do not think less. Although I must warn you that there seems to be a surplus on my side. Ted (2030): Children, sometimes in life, the planets align, everything comes together, and your timing is perfect.(Marshall and Lily calls Marshall called Lily but neither Marshall or Lily of the horizon. Lily sits on a bench and Marshall as well) It was not one of those moments. Ted (2030): As I said, it was a storm of three days. Tuesday... Ted (2030): Wednesday...

I can not believe you that turns the country. Unless a bear attacks you in 3 seconds with your legs and you break his neck, it has nothing to do in your demo. Folks, sorry to stop you before Marshall falls into tears, but Robin, check it out. What you need is a super video resume. Like mine. I present to you: Barneysvideocv.com.(The video starts with an expl*si*n) Hello. Barney Stinson, you have achieved great successes in business, sport and personal relationships, and have been an inspiration to many people. How could that be me? He is an Englishman. What would you recommend to your many admirers who want to reach the peak of their potential? The first thing to know about success is that it will not come to you. Most people associate success with money and power, but in fact it is a mindset. And when it comes to success, the only limit is that there is no limit. Exactly. Because that's what the world wants to work.People who seem to take risks, but never do anything. In fact, you do things will turn. I write a book about this phenomenon. No, it would be... You listen? All my life I have dared to go beyond the possible. Until the impossible? In fact, beyond that... where the possible and the impossible meet to become... the possimpossible. Inventing your own word shows creativity and vision...""Visia-ness."" If I can leave you with one thought, is this one: nothing... and all... is possimpossible. (Several assembly passes with a song) This guy is awesome. Absolutely not. It would be stupid. Stinson, Barney Stinson singing this song, it would be really stupid. One of the fans who think this guy is awesome. Perfect and available.Great, Great, Great, Great, Great, Great... Great, great. Barney Stinson, committed. This jewel has earned me 11 jobs. Now, we talk about it. OK, we should get started. I have much to shoot, I can not use the tapes I have of you. Let's start. What does it mean to be a reporter for you? Cut! You're mired in details. We need you to be vague, at ease with buzzwords like ""synergy"" and ""dynamism"". You can invent a word, as... ""Relationality."" All right. Do not do it. There are many exciting stories to cover in Canada. I just read it, the nephew of the mayor of Winnipeg went fishing on the ice and took a pole of 7 Kg Live from the worst place in the world, I'm Robin Scherbatsky. I like it. Come on! relationality, this is mine. Showdown. You're not the first to wear it here. But it expresses the power. And that, too. Now, I need you break these 15 bricks with your forehead. I am a man. You're a woman. Assume that you can do nothing. You must prove that society is wrong. There is more in 1950. Yes, you can. Why? What's the matter? Oh, my God. It's horrible. It'll be along to commute. I've finished your video resume myself. I posted it to all channels of the city. A guy called from Channel 8. He adores you. He wants you to pass an audition. I said no. Robin Scherbatsky do not audition. He is given the job or anything. No. He cursed me and hung up. But after Channel 12, called. They'll love it too. They offer you to host their new talk show in the morning. I sent them shit. They want you even more. So they increased their offer by 10%. Congratulations. Looks like you'll have to stay. I am the master of possimpossible."

The dancer's hip, Marshall's ax dancer. Come on, guys. It did not hurt while dancing. Obviously, the stirrups were too far apart during his last visit to the gynecologist. Barney, I do not understand. You doing anything in these clips. The possimpossible? Oh yeah? Barney, it was ridiculous and foolish. What? Honey. You're always sorry for the joke of the dancer?They joked. We all know that this is a basketball injury. What? What? I do not know how to answer that. How many dances are we talking about? Why do you dance much, and I do not know why? You hurt the hip like that? You know what? The two geniuses are going to remove that crap on their CV. You're not Dr. X, and you can not do the dunk. Forget. What are you insinuating? A species of b*st*rd. It teaches kids... I can eat a lot of hot dogs very quickly. You can dunk over, hip cardboard! I think so. You're not going to dance?"

If you think people liked your show, it's wrong... No, guys... it does not work like that. Robin will have its license if it works in his field. You could stay if you got married to a U.S. citizen. Yes, it might work. No. The procedure to formalize it would take too much time. It will not work. No, no, I understand. Your origins are part of what you sell. Moreover, in 'Special jurisdiction' on my resume, I put that in Minnesota, I was dunk champion Nicollet County in 1995. Yes, why not? Many companies have a basketball team. They like that TonnerreVanille can still crash into the net. Yeah, TonnerreVanille. The ghost of snowshoes.The gate man. I was not very good in defense. Bine sure if.

Yes, absolutely. I have something to say. I dance more than you think. I dance... more than you think. I know. I think... I would say... average. I do that when I'm alone. When something good happens, and I'm excited and move, and I... I dunno, I want to talk about it. Super! Thank you, Herm. It's not funny. The doctor said if it gets worse, I should have surgery. You know who has not made a lot of vaginas in college? Dr. X. I know! Does July 4, 1995 does remind you of anything? Yes, but you can not! How dare you? These hips can... It's OK. Later.

1020,4,14,rochelle ,Presenter. You must have a mirror finish. What is yours?
1021,4,14,ted ,"And only 60% of them are prisoners. It's terrible. And bad... also. The problem may be your CV. Have you seen like mine is ventilated? Yours is too busy. No one knows. It was a mysterious and awesome DJ. His identity is still secret. But this phantom waves changed the face of the campus radio. No. We will not let them. One of us will help you find. Maybe there is something in it that people do not like.We'll watch it, OK? You've put champion dunk in your CV? You can dunk more. I have a technical question. Is it easier to dance when you do not have external genitalia? Is that you? You INTERVIEWED yourself? And a little Scottish. You were supposed to be on a motorcycle to say that? It's you again...? You sing a song about you? Impossible. I've taken a light beer. I know the dancers count calories. As a vaginal rejuvenation? Who? It was perfect! Marshall and I are the only ones here with shit on our resume? What it's related to your job as mistress? Guys! Robin must leave Canada. 33! Why nobody comes to my events?"

Finally, except Lily."
1025,4,15,barney ,"No, I must go. Maybe I did not like. My God, you think that the male spirit is really so simple, we all have a favorite type? Lord.Asian, big tits. I go to the bathroom, then I'm going. OK, to Saturday. (Marshall is in the doorway) I was thinking of a brunch, and perhaps a hike. I love you too. A plus. Nowhere. At the beach. It's winter. Laser Tag. At home. Shut up! It is you who are going somewhere. What are you doing here? Who? These are my friends. Ted, Marshall, Lily and Robin.Guys, here is Loretta. My mother. Mom! Yes, you got me. I guess you can leave. Ted, Marshall, Lily, Robin. I present to you Betty... my wife. And my son, Tyler. She wants me to live long. Me too. Will in, little rascal! I'll see you at the bar? It's a long story. As you know, my father had to leave my mother when I was a baby because he became presenter of the Just Price. She had to raise my brother and I, all alone. And his only wish was that his son did not end up alone like her. And there seven years, she fell ill. I do not think she was going to make. So I decided to fulfill his wish. Mom. This is Betty. We're engaged. I hired an actress to play my girlfriend ""Betty"". His real name is Margaret. It is mainly small theaters. Superb actress.In it a Moliere. I say no more. This is political. I should not talk about it. But there is a problem. Betty has a slight tendency to improvise. You see, Mom? I found someone who makes me happy. As you wished. And then my mother went better. It was miraculous.But I had to keep ""Betty"" and make a casting to find my son, Tyler. For a while, it was enough to borrow / keep the baby from neighbors. And once at Christmas, my mother was drunk at the grog, I went out with a bag of flour and a Chucky mask.But eventually I had to audition. four, eight... thirteen, you stay. The other, you can leave. Apparently I'm better actor than your son. Bring those from 11! And that's how the role of Tyler went to... Grant. Really? Look. Tyler? Tyler? Tyler? Grant? You see? This is amateur work. Believe me, the child stars had better possession in the 80s. Karate Kid's a great movie. This is the story of a young karate enthusiast whose dreams led him to Karate Championship All Star Valley. Unfortunately, he loses in the final against another loser. But he learned an important lesson in accepting his defeat. No, I'm for the other loser from New Jersey who barely knows karate. When I watch Karate Kid, I'm for real karate kid: Johnny Lawrence of Cobra Kai dojo. Do not get dumber than you are, Lily. No, no question. The truth would k*ll her. On the bed ""race car""? We talked about it a million times! You get no slogan! I can make another cast. Will remember your sentences for the big dinner scene. Just a little script. Things that my mother will be pleased to hear. The nostrils dilated. They do it when she gets mad. I love it. As now. Like now! Sorry, my little bear. Continues. You really like that for a relationship. Funny story, the other night, this little rascal had a nightmare. He came to tell us what it was, you remember what you said? Page 4... Tyler said: ""In my nightmare, mom and you did not know how much I loved you. So I'm here to say it was great...like that. "" We're a happy family. No weak link in this scene. Bravo! Go and eat your ice. Guess who is not lactose intolerant: Tyler. Tyler will go there and enjoy every bite. Yum! You're not gonna get us out a slogan. I, yes. Follow me. I... been betrayed by my best friend.How could you do that, Ted? Think of the poor Tyler who tries valiantly to hold back tears. It's good my boy, you can cry.Weep! What can you have to say for yourself? Sorry. What? For God's sake, what are you talking? No, not at all. Mom, you leave us a moment? You've lost your mind? What's wrong with you? How do I explain this to my mother? Mom, I've got something to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. Tyler is dying. And Betty said that when he is gone, it will go out. So it may soon be over. None of this is true! The truth is that... Betty and Tyler are actors I hired to pretend to be my family. I just wanted you to think I had the life you wanted for me. I wanted you to be proud of me. It sounds crazy, and I'm sorry, Mom. No. Really? Is it not? I know! They are not horrible? So really, you angry with me? Really? I'm really relieved because in reality, I am also far from being a married man can be. My stories with women you would shock and horrify you. Seriously, you can not imagine what I could do. Mom! I'll try. Nope! Hans Gruber, the villain class. At the end, it is trapped.This is the title character. The teacher who is watching. This is the only one who passes the whole movie in a suit. What is the title, Robin? Who among us has not shed a tear when his small red eye goes to the end and he can not k*ll these people? Sorry. The film... They even try to help!"
1026,4,15,betty ,"But forget, one meatloaf, after what was said Dr. Grossbard on your cholesterol. Guilty. I love you. I'm pregnant! Really? Thank you. I know not, finally, the purpose of Brecht's work is of course... You know it really theater. Look, if you want, I can give you advice as an actor. I would love. Rule number one player... And I really thought that Barney had forgot our anniversary. So I rushed into the garden, smoke coming out of my ears. You better stop! So I go out raging in the garden, and... candles everywhere... and a string quartet. You come to believe? Rule number one player: ""Do not be afraid to improvise."" Rule number 5 player: ""Invent a rich backdrop for your character. "" Rule number 8 player: ""Do not be afraid to come to blows. "" You were amazing! You really become that character. Breathe loudly as if the result would be hard to say. I love you. Do like I was nice."

1028,4,15,grant ,"Yes? At least one person who still loves to play. I miss that. I hate. But what can I do? I get no phone call. Come on, you're still beautiful. I love your new nose. That's it. Neither do I. But it's funny. I can not. I'm lactose intolerant. How were my tears? It may be like that in your new job. I know. We are sorry! I thought something was happening."
1029,4,15,lily ,"Look. Three beautiful blondes drinking bad decision juice at 8am. Seriously? They are blond and stuffed. This is not your type? You noticed that Barney is weird lately? Yes. You think it is possible that Barney Stinson has a girlfriend? Wait. Where are you going? My God. He goes to see now. Where is she? Your girlfriend. You did not really like, huh? So that's what we hide you? You did not want people to know that you're a momma's boy. It's crazy. Did you actually cast your own son? It sounds like your mother kept your child's room as you had left. Wait. When you watch Karate Kid, you are the wicked little blonde? I can not believe that there has never met you. Who knew that Barney's mother was so great? I'm sorry? Warm? Remember to marriage, I said we would be together forever? On our return down the aisle, your mother leaned over and said, ""Not forever, darling. Marshall will go to heaven. "" She hates me, Marshall. But that's okay, because...Forget. Nothing. You want to go do it again in the bedroom of Barney? Really? I hate your mother. No, not at all. It may be time to tell him the truth. And I just wanted to say, if I was never cold or distant, I'm sorry. It mean a lot to me if we could be closer. I love you... Do like I was nice. I mean, it's really nice of you, Judy.You too. See you soon. OK, and Breakfast Club?"
1030,4,15,loretta ,"Nice to meet you. I feel I already know you. Barney can not stop talking about you every day. Betty and I are going to prepare dinner. There will be something for everyone. It's beautiful. I wish I could stay for small children. Thank you, darling. Actually, I was not so perfect a mother when I was younger. Yeah, I was rather a drag. A drag, darling. A dirty streak. I am not proud. But...Finally, I had fun. There's no pleasure as intense as... to watch a guy in the eye and say, ""I do not know your name, and you either, but... the next eight minutes we're going to flinch foundations of this gas station toilet. "" Then to proceed in opposite directions. And just drive. Finally, all this is history now. I did the best I could, but... Sometimes, I wonder how Barney was able to become so perfect. In two minutes, meat loaf! And my boy Ty-Ty. What's new? It was cute. I will take a little ice in the freezer downstairs and make the ice creams in the kitchen. It's time for ice! My God! I do not understand. There was chocolate and caramel. There are lots of kinds of noodles and marshmallows. Honey, you okay? My God! What? Well, Betty is not your wife? thank you God! I do not like this woman. Yes. And Tyler... I know I am his grandmother and I'm supposed to love him, but I hate him. ""Tyler not love! ""What does that mean? With your fake friends over there, I wanted to shoot myself. I'm confused. I do not know why you thought having to do that. I love you, perfect family or not. I love you, no matter what. Really. Whatever. I love you always. When you were 3 years old, I left you with a babysitter and spent three weeks with Grand Funk Railroad, from one guy to another like a bang. Promise me one thing. If ever you meet someone special, do not run away. Do not like me. Take a chance, okay?"
1031,4,15,marshall ,"Pretty radar chest. This is my wife. Now that you say, Barney did something weird yesterday at the office. I thought he was talking to a girl he just wanted to jump. Or Ted, but now I know more. Where is Barney? Bob Barker is your father. It's a huge Karate Kid poster above your bed. Do not say that. I'm sure you were great. Barney Mom? Loretta. You must tell the truth to your mother, OK? Listen, this is a nice woman, loving, a little too direct that deserves better. I do not feel well to the idea of lying to a woman so warm, OK? It reminds me of my mother. What? She was joking. You're going to say what? The handles are great. Listen, Lily, if you learned something today, is that honesty is important in a family.Whatever your feelings about my mother, we've been together for 12 years, baby. I think I can handle it. You know what? I hate you! Thank you very much, man. Tonight I will not sleep. You can stop with that? I know. Sometimes, honesty leads people to say bad things about the woman who always took care of me because I was the runt of the family. For God's sake, I'm just a 92 m! My mother. That I understand that. You tell me when you watch Karate Kid, you're not in San Daniel?"

You do not like playing the son of Barney? I know what it is. I am a presenter. But I had to accept a job on a morning show that starts at 4:30. I thought evolve much faster than that, you know? I'm almost 30 years. I have not had surgery. Wait. You wrote that we will have dinner? What kind? Come on, Barney. You have no idea of the difficulty of getting a job beneath you. I really liked your tip on the bones of dinosaurs. Perfect. You see? Even in a role that you hate, you manage to love what you do. You think so? Thank you, Grant. You're pretty smart, you know that? The taxi is here. Who speaks it? I have one. Terminator."

It is even more in Manhattan. Where does this girl? He stops. Come on, Grant looks pretty good. I just remembered where I know you. I saw you play at the theater of disorientation, Die heilige Johanna der Schlachth&ouml;fe by Bertolt Brecht, last fall. You were a revelation! Yes. Yes. Sorry. You got a Brechtophile before thee! Mrs Theatre has won my heart once and has never left me. Every year at Christmas, I created a piece for parents with all the kids. Cut! Cut!

Something even funnier happened to Marshall today. I have used questionable methods to skip a very silly girl. You're kidding me! So far. Tells the story, tells the story! I'm not kidding. I almost do not want you to hear, because really, for the rest of your life, nothing will ever be as fun and you, curse you for agreeing to hear. You gotta hear it.This is too funny. Wait. Expect.

Laser tag your skills are almost nonexistent. And your wardrobe, it's like, what, you're allergic to fabric quality?Seriously, pull yourself together. What are we talking? Pant, pant...

You thought I would buy tickets to WrestleMania? It was ironic. Before you say a word, I think you should read Les Fleurs du Mal by Baudelaire. Say I had a beret different every day. It was pretentious. I want to make a scene, but in your list of wines, there is a Chateauneuf-du-Pape listed under ""C&ocirc;tes de Provence"".You should tell your waiter. Schopenhauer had a discussion daring, in which he opposed... I'm sorry. Sorry. (She goes out then comes back) The color palette is a bit derivative of the first Van Gogh, right? I'll have a beer. You want one? A beer. I decanted Bordeaux. It's a moment you move away. I intended to break. OK, you're right. I'm good in literature. Gifted in art.Good at identifying a French wine for less than a kilometer from where the grapes grew. But... I'm really bad to watch someone and say what I feel. Ted, wait. In fact, ""good bye"" means ""until we see each other again."" So I guess you mean that in fact, we'll meet again?"
1042,4,16,lily ,"Those with a show at 5am? What do you want? Sometimes it's like that. The same thing over and over again. One of my students ate glue. Karen is here? My God, it was a real idiot. Of course, for you. You had it turned into a zombie of andouille. You pass me the salt? Let's go! What? You can not get back with Karen. My name is Lily and I approve this order. You know the story. Ted and Karen had a rocky relationship in college. It always happened like this. They were having fun, being obnoxious until one day... They hated it! Then Ted went up the noggin and took the bus to Providence to tell Karen's four truths. And finally, all over again from scratch. Are you kidding! I can not believe that thou hast called. Why do not you invite him to lunch as you're at it? You have to lunch? As my high school boyfriend, Scooter. The Lilium, not stupid. Sorry, I have no scooter for you. It is this server? Robin, I will have to borrow the butt of your g*n. How can you break bread with this chick? What has happened? Ted, darling. Go outside and bite the curb. I arrive in 1 minute. What do you mean you forgot your pants? And the spare. Ted, you're not going out so easily. While the history of pants is fun... That's nothing compared to this crazy thing with Karen.Ends. Why do you say ""the restaurant""? You've embraced elsewhere? Marshall forgot his pants today, and yet you are the stupidest in this table. assh*le. February 5,... In 1998. I painted... Ted Horn, critique my painting, anything, that's your business. But I catch you eyeing the mess of my guy and you lingered? You'll be received well. He had eaten my fruit bowl. The fact is that Karen is a dirty pervert, you can not bring into our lives. I just give something to Marshall. But I'm in a hurry. I can give it to you? And you give him? What are you talking? Marshall forgot his pants, so I brought him one. Awesome. Thank you. I'll finish for you. Ted left without saying anything, and Karen got exactly what she wanted. You know, this is perhaps good that you called Karen. Wait a minute. You said that you never reparlerais him?So how do you know she has followed your advice?"
1043,4,16,man ,"Look at him. Yeah, or the fallopian tube. Sorry, dude. Sorry, dude. My God. How could you? Auditions for Oliver Twist are down!"
1044,4,16,marshall ,"So you do really? You really gonna go to work at 2am. Who is a fan of a program broadcast at 4am? You know, as usual. First, nothing is funnier than that. Then it's not such a good story. Dude, the gold medal of the andouille de Vire. I want to eat your brain, but only if it is organic and free range. It's... a TV. I know... you was ironic. Me too... I'm ironic. This makeup has one month to go. I met with parents of Lily. I have never looked so stupid. Get off me! Okay. This morning I was in the gymnasium of the box to play basketball. The guys from work can be quite violent with their taunts. I think that the knees are made to bend like that. He may have torn his cruciate ligament. I can be a bit watered down dialogue, whatever... I searched my bag to get my stuff working... Okay. Say it. I forgot... It is not the worst, no. That would be the fourth worst.1: Super volcano. 2: An asteroid falls to Earth. 3: Any record of Evel Knievel is lost. 4: Ted called Karen. 5: Lily is eaten by a shark. After that, they broke. Ted was totally depressed, and we waited the necessary time to tell him what we thought of it. Bye bye, the slut! How was it? I regret it at all. Go back in your little head it. Why do you want to lunch with an ex? As my lunch with Nicole Barsamian. My ex. Hi, Nicole. You look pretty. Already? Who? You must cancel the luncheon. You must embrace strangely. You can not change the subject like that. It was nothing! I had a small problem, so I called Lily. I forgot my pants. I forgot. You have a bringest me. Last Thursday, the mustard? You have a goldfish memory. You did what? In his defense, I had just the muscle. It's a foregone conclusion. Ted is Charlie Brown trying to shoot and Karen, it's Lucy who takes away the ball at the last second and sleeping with. You have understood me.Ted falls in love, and Karen is going wrong with a playboy, who says... ""Sorry, dude."" Damn! Stop changing the subject. You have gone too far. You are complicit in breaking the heart of this poor guy.And you, you are best placed to know how it feels. What? Okay! Lily came to the office to bring me my pants... Because I forgot. As you can see on page 44 of the contract... You can look at page 44 of the contract? What has happened to Karen? It shows my calves."

1047,4,16,robin ,"Hello, everyone. I do not for me. I do it for the fans. They are. Put me know. It's been what? It's good. So a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos? Come on, guys. You are four young people active in the most exciting city in the world. And you have nothing to tell me? Wait. It's really funny? He forgot his pants. It's pretty funny. Less than a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos. I mean, he... he forgot that he was already one? Moron, the monkey. She came to see you in college and when you had my back turned, she brought the guys in your room? No. As my lunch with Curt. My short-barreled 38 Special Police! I knew that I had left it somewhere. Every time I watch the news, I pray it is not my g*n. Who is Nicole Barsamian? I still lost. You come to believe? How to say goodbye in these situations? A kiss on the cheek, too familiar. A handshake, too formal. The pants. What do you mean by linger? The game is the game It happened to us? Where was I? Do not worry. I will say nothing to Marshall. What is the result with the bimbo? You really do speak of your pants? Is that all? It's the story? I am impressed. For you too have worn it all day?"
1048,4,16,scooter ,"This is super funny! I forgot your humor. Why? You like the servers? I can be a waiter. I will become the best server in the world, and you'll love me!"
1049,4,16,ted ,"The addicts who have not sold their TV? My ex, Karen, is in New York. The usual routine. It was not that bad. What? Bluntly. Bluntly. Bluntly. So, Karen in New York. Bizarre, no? I never said I'd do that. I thought it arrives. That would be the worst disaster if I called? You find pepperoni fascist and you're so right, so... (He finds Karen in bed with another) Oh, my God! Karen! I broke up with Karen. Super. Look who's here! It's gonna be 10,002 Maniacs, because I have tickets to Natalie Merchant... I was an idiot. It was my first real girlfriend. I was crazy about her. We've all done things we regret in college. In the third year, Marshall has grown the goatee, wearing a beret and Rasta required to be called MJ Cool. So you really think that I should not call? OK, OK. Interesting information: it is already done. Because I will not invite him to lunch... again. I'd do that, of course... if he had not already occurred. It was a lunch and not eat wheat. It was nice to be back.We even laughed at the idiots we were. Say I had a picture of Moliere on my backpack. Bluntly pretentious. I hate change, but take us brushettes and fresh mozzarella. Grazie. It was great. There was an odd moment near the end. So... Karen was the first girl I really loved. And after the year I had, I dunno, I think of lunch with her reminded me what it was to turn 18 and life ahead. And I would remind everyone that at least I was wearing pants. That's all. It was just a kiss in a restaurant. As in a tree? No, it was not done in a tree. What is his problem? Lily, let's be honest. We know both your motives. You hate Karen because she lingered. Why paint naked? Relax, it was just one night! And three after. And one morning. But at least I had pants. Even if, in fact, I had not. You know the sleeping pills you take for your crazy schedule? They are stronger than you think. False! You got to let the right answer in your pants, because that's exactly what did not happen. Sorry, dude. That was me. Me. The one time Marshall forgot his pants? And you did not give him. Not this time. You have a boyfriend? You're unbelievable. You do not have the guts to break up with someone decent. So, you've preferred to ride it all. We're both zero for that. But... I think we need to change.Why do not I would start? You are really hurtful and reckless.Goodbye. Sorry, dude. Of course. And that for me, too. Later, she spoke with Jerry, and the discussion was that it avoided breaking with me. Right. On this subject... After breaking up with this guy, we went out, we slept since we're together. It's really okay, this time it's different. Here it is. Be nice!"
1050,4,16,waiter ,What would you like? And for you?
1051,4,16,wendy ,"Happy is that way at last. You know, after you have rejected nine times, I almost drop. Actually, there is one thing I wanted to give you. It's a tie!"
1052,4,16,,"Ted (2030): In 2009, your Aunt Robin had a morning show.She had to get up early enough. At what point? 1:45, Robin joined Barney, Ted, Marshall and Lily to McClaren's. Ted (2030): Children, I think you talked about Karen. Ted (2030): It was my girlfriend in high school and at times in college. She was beautiful, intelligent. I was crazy in love with her. The only problem, Marshall and Lily were not. It should probably come out of this as soon as we opened. Ted (2030): Because that's what happened. Ted (2030): An afternoon at Karen. Ted (2030): This time, the playboy with whom she deceived... Ted (2030): You see, children, sometimes when you have to have a difficult discussion, the better to do..."
1053,4,17,all ,Hi.
1054,4,17,barney ,"It's unfortunate! I do not know what it is, this shrew. Okay, she has boobs, but... In fact, I see. I've never seen. I've never seen. I've never seen. I just said. We should not celebrate. Ted has just been dumped.Tell us everything, everything that happened. Seriously, do not forget any details. She said what? You, you said what? How you going? If you had to redo it from start, perhaps you...? What a story. What courage to share it with us. Of course. You think I'm sleeping in it? First, it's a tie night. Second, it's not for comfort. This class is to be at any time. Let me tell you a story that happened to me recently. But it could happen. If it happened and I was in top form for these oiled bitches, I would regret it. Marshall wearing a nightgown! He wears a nightgown! You know when they say, ""Remember, he was wearing a nightgown? ""It is now! This is a nightgown. Call it, ""Held danger of Ninja,"" if you want. You stay still a tr*nsv*stite. Nice to fly to Neverland with Peter Pan? Me, again! It was nice to get out of bed to accompany Charlie to the chocolate? Oh, me, me! Something about Scrooge! Come on, guys. I do all the work. It is pretty! You know not to play bridge, eh? If the angel Clarence says it's true, it should be. Why are you wearing this stuff? You can not even give five. I have to stand still to avoid offending my pajama suit.But at least I do not wear a dress. I feel a little breeze there. It's nice. The Little Barney says ""Mahalo."" My God, what has happened? The show! Sorry. It happened something? It's called a shirt. Calm down! Let us be calm! I have a question. This is how when you're in bed? You're at home, every night, and Lily layer always with you? Tell me about marriage. The coffee too? I love flowers. And sometimes when you're afraid of making wrong choices and you're not the one you wanted to be, what it does? It's beautiful. And it helps you to find other girls to sleep with?"
1055,4,17,barney by nightdress, Your grandfather was a wise Olaf.
1056,4,17,karen ,"Hi all. They are real diamonds? I did not say that I loved. I'm sure that minors exploited in Sierra Leone you would type in five if they still had their fingers. But it's nice.Meet me at the top. Now! No, it's you who love the Chianti 2002. Expect. What is this? What's she doing here? Have you slept with Robin? Why I believe you? Why I believe you? I knew it was a mistake. It's good. It's over. What are you doing... (She kisses him before he finished his sentence) Lily rose and explained everything to me. And she gave me this for you. Sabotaging our relationship? I must admit that even setting the bar really low for judging friends, Lily really outdid themselves. Clearly, we can not see her again. I know. It's hard, huh?"
1057,4,17,lily ,"That's because he met her in high school. This is his first girlfriend. How can they call it a ""daily""? 4h, it's still the middle of the night. You impressed me. We want to encourage you. I just want to sleep! How did that happen? Wait. That's your pajamas? You sleep in pajamas suit? This is not ""a"" skin flick, it's the scene... Forget it. Ted, it will start! Wait! Marshall did nothing. It's me. I made you break. I did it for your own good. You do not see how it was horrible. She failed the test of the porch. You, Me and Marshall are friends since college. Imagine how they account for one another. So when I look to the future, I see us all together. (Lily imagines the scene) When will retirees, sipping tea on the porch of our house, playing bridge all day. It will take over. So whenever you go out with someone for a while, I take the test of the porch. How that person will fit over the years?And when I think of Karen... Karen has failed the test of the porch. She had to leave. Do you like is great, you, me and Marshall. Really, think about it. It is really great! So for that you will marry, one that will join the Team Géniale, the bar is very high. I say that I did well, but... I confirm. You can uncross your legs? So you're really angry? I'm really sorry. I hated to do it again, but Karen had to leave. Never! Six. No one! Angie. In the second year. She used you to get revenge on her ex, and you will not see it, so... Do you remember this strange girl who wanted you to marry him after two months? You loved him in trouble, but you thought there anyway, so... Ted, I did it to help you. You're addicted to the commitment. You fell in love with these women, even if they do not deserve you. If there was any chance, I swear, I would have done anything. As Victoria or Stella. Stop talking to me as if I were your enemy! You know these women cry, but you have the luxury of not knowing what I know: you have these breaks tragic surely avoided a first marriage crap and very expensive. You do not want the truth, because deep down, you want me to watch over you. And basically, you know that none of these women would have been the mother of your children. I did what I had to do. Just as I did! No, it's not... I did it because I care about you! Robin was different. I did not mean that you break, but you wanted different things and you refused to settle it. I could imagine the porch. I was just trying to make you talk about your problems. I did not know it would lead to your break. I have a funny joke. Where you see yourself in five years?(Later that night, Lily is with Robin at McClaren's) You know what's funny? Funny questions. Where you see yourself in five years? Not that I want to make you say, but surely you want to get married. You would surely be in Tokyo or Paris. I was not... Or you'd been together too long, and would have had an incredibly bitter break without even remain friends, and we would never become best friends. It is what happened to your jacket? Ted, I'm sorry. No matter who you marry. I know it will be great because she will think you are. To prove my sincerity, I have prepared a surprise for you and Karen at the top. Kisses, Lily."
1058,4,17,marshall ,"Ted, Karen is an idiot. I put the forms there. For us, Karen is an idiot. For him, this is the first to have touched his pen1s in hand himself, his mother and pediatrician. That is clear. Sure! Weather. Sorry. You know what? This Friday, everyone will come home at 3:30. We leave the pajamas and watch his show. I hate Robin not to have done better. I knew you were listening! In your face! It's not look comfortable at all. You wear a tie. Why have the class at any time? Sorry, dude, but it is the nightwear most ridiculous I've seen in my life. Finally... I do not care. It's comfortable. What are you talking? I would never... There's nothing to admit! It's important to stay active. You're better off without her. You know what? Go ahead, laugh. Several reasons. A: You can not wear anything underneath. Two: It's sexy. Three: My grandfather was Olaf and he died at 107 years. Four: No elastic waistband leaving its mark around my Thanksgiving belly. And five: each night as I sleep, it's the most wonderful and free feeling in the world. I feel... as if I was flying. That's how I'm going to bed at night: happy, light. With a heart full of joy. And you? That's where is my CD of Creed. You think that's good? Come to the mouth of heating.It's like your bazaar was on a tropical island. A shirt. I do not like this scenario. Come, let's check. Yeah, marriage, man, unconditional love. You can wear what you want and you get laid. Sometimes when you're married, the smell of breakfast wakes you ready. The cafe also. Sometimes she even puts a vase of fresh flowers. It says you're great and everything will be fine. I guess. If you have agreed, perhaps. The guy had a hard day. We'll talk tomorrow. Good night, champ. PS: Sorry that the envelope is opened. I read what she wrote. Marshall."
1059,4,17,robin ,"Disgusted! Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thank you. I got a great deal... They need a finger to do what I think. It's almost 2am. I must work. It's been almost a month. I'm used to. And then the show is not bad, right? You've ever watched? Your favorite item? Have you ever looked. I know, this is basic and bland, and it is smaller audiences than the Korean channel that does that Kim Jong Il by the horse. But, friends, it would touch me to know that at least once you look. You're the best. Hello, New York. I'm Robin... You have not seen the show? The routine. What? We do break? What does that mean? And why they wear a night gown? And you? I would surely be in Argentina. Or Tokyo, or Paris. My God. So, without you we would come out still together? Do not say that. Soot, breadcrumbs, placenta. You have not even registered? So, it's over? beef pie, macaroni and cheese, butter cookie house. Thank you. Basically, Lily made us break. If it had not been there, we always go out together? We should make a pact. If the years pass and only 40 years old, one is always alone... A girl dreams of hearing those words. A million times, yes! Genre? Just one thing: no nightgown."
1060,4,17,ted ,"Sorry, can not stay. Nice set of forms. Believe it or not, my friends do not have a say on which I frequent. This is my life. I decide. I arrive. Hi, guys. Bad news: I was Karen plated. Go ahead. This is totally stupid. We were together, you know, we laughed... It's you who love the Chianti 2002. Looks like the earring Robin. Bizarre. It's you... I know. What? Of course not! She had to be found in the laundry. Maybe because I've always been faithful, when thou hast deceived me 6 times, bitch. Right? I too would have said that. Maybe because I've always been faithful, while you... I love you... That's it. She's gone. A coffin. It's not an anecdote, it's a porno. I know. I live with Marshall for 12 years. Every time I put something, it's a victory. I arrive. Marshall, I found an earring Robin on your dresser. You know why the other was in my bed? You hate Karen. You told me to break it. It's you. Did you put the loop in my bed for Karen to find. Admit it! Why was it on your dresser? I swear, if you tell me the truth on the field... You made me break with Karen? Are you sick? What right did you do that? What is this test? I can not believe you did that. It's pretty awesome. I confirm. You can cross your legs? I know. I mean, I guess if you get all this for Karen, then it may be better. ""Redo""? How many times you made me break with my girlfriends? Like who? Creed? Oh, my God, I have to break up with her. Who else? That was you? It's crazy! And if one of them was to be the mother of my children? Or Robin. Or Robin. You made us break too? You made us break too? You have made us break up? You have made us break up? You have made us break up? You made me break with Robin? I can not believe it. I need another drink. Seriously, just what is your problem? How could you do that? Lily has just told us it made us break. It turns out that Lily has decided to sabotage many of my relationships, including ours. Where do you see yourself in five years? I would probably get married. In Argentina? We have a deadline, does not it? You can not manipulate people like that! I've known you for 12 years, but I've never been back! I want to hear! Stop cuddling! You got no right to interfere in my relationships you. You're lucky. You have found the love of your life in a dorm you turn 18. It gives you no right to play God while others are still looking for. You worry so much about who will finish with you on the porch. You know what? Keep it for you. I realized that no matter what my friends think of my girlfriend, but it really matters what my girlfriend thinks of my friends. Yes. If you wanna be my guest, Lily is a sacred stove. Normal Marshall dies at age 68. It makes you wonder. Maybe. She was right. We were not ready. We needed to move forward, we do our stuff. It is always the case. Will you be my wife back? Okay, that's it. Do we must etablire rules? I know. As not to become huge, that sort of thing. I'll never wear."

We did it to protect you. Sorry, Ted. Not at all. Kiefer Sutherland, souvenir glasses, tights and a Pancake. So we... invented the working group. It was enough just to gather a team. You see Roy Waterman, Vice President of Venture Capital? It's actually... Roy maintenance. (In the hallway...) I'm sorry, Roy. How would you like to make you some money? Louisa Mendoza, Vice President at Capital exécutie, It's actually... Louisa from the cafeteria. (In the canteen...) Louisa, I need your help, but forbidden to speak. Exactly. This is an important secret. How do you say ""secret"" in Spanish? Okay. Albondigas. This will be our little albondigas. I have balls, please? Arthur and Nasmith, the eccentric genius, investment guru, it's actually... Arty the cracked one-man band of 15th Street. (In the street...) Excuse me. One can argue? It was completed with the group of trainees and paid $ 50 for them to look enthusiastic when you talked... Good job. When you played third base for the softball team GNB. Sorry, we knew you'd be unemployed soon. We wanted you to feel good. Friends do that. Sometimes, yes, to protect them. You're like me, people? Have you ever considered the amount of fish species? And... the name of these fish?Here are a few. ""Trout. ""Right? ""Sturgeon. ""I think so buddy.""Salmon. ""I'll say it again... Salmon. Who thought it was a good idea? ""Bar. ""This guy is what I mean. ""Halibut. ""Thank you, good evening. How do I? Timeout. You do not like fish? Whatever... This proves my point. You lied to me to protect me. What if we told you that you found another project to GNB, where you have to redo part of the 20th floor. It turns people here. GNB think we need a safe place to meet new. Read it. Who the hell... The Old King Clancy is? And fame, this is Harvey Léplateaux? Hey, Mister Whisper. You should not be up there to draw your super PTE? What? You're kidding. Why? So, do we want it?"
1072,4,18,marshall and barney, I have to say?
1073,4,18,robin ,"You know, the celebrities, they like really weird s*x stuff. Believe me. It's embarrassing, but I... I came home one evening with a celebrity. He wanted to do weird things with me, so I left. That's it.End of story. Not you, Barney. I'll tell you anything specific. But all I will say is that he is Canadian, but you know it. And he brought home by offering to show me a single collection. As you collect stamps or coins. But I say nothing. I know not what you call it, but we have a name for it in Canada. Listen, I've already said too much. Yes. I'll tell you. But only if you correctly guess the three parties. Right. Well, the only thing that carries the woman is skates with his hands. It's like the Moustache of Chicago, but the person below wearing a combi. I dunno, I want to know. These people are crazy. Okay, but I say only if you find the person, the act and the collection. No. No. No. I would have accepted it. No. For me, it's called a... No. Well. You really want to know? But this info does not leave the table. So? This is not the person is the sexual act. It's like the Sacramento Turtleneck, but with maple syrup. No, it's the collection. Harvey trays. These orange trays they give you when you eat at Harvey. Restaurants? Will you take a trip on the Trans-Canada Highway, you have a hollow between Milverton and Wawa, where you stop eating, eh? At Harvey. More than 12,000 customers! The Frozen Snowshoe. Oh, my God! You know Racket jelly? This is the most famous pro wrestler of Canada. I met him after his victory over Rick ""The Daredevil"" at the Rogers Memorial Arena in Kamloops in 2002. A classic. Right. And I'm serious, do not tell anyone. It's very impressive, The Frozen Snowshoe. So... Snowshoeing Would you like me... Old King Clancy one?"

1076,4,18,ted ,"Wooden beams immersed in natural light from the atrium.They will love it! On the roof, a Zen garden to pray silently. In the lobby, a fountain where local kids can make wishes. The new GNB, your workplace and your home. Thank you, and.. welcome home. Yeah, it's Ted. No, no. I have not approved the change in plans for the new GNB headquarters, which I am the chief architect, just 30 years. Yes, I'm single and I give to charity.What is the relationship? Okay, bye, Mr. Mayor. You know it was bogus? I just had a conversation strange. A woman at the GNB told me that the new tower was abandoned last month. It's crazy, right? What is this look? What's going on? How are you? I'm frustrated. The least innovative thing in my drawings, Bilson cuts with a machete. I hate to depend on what kind of guy. Are you kidding? They still come to turn a guy in my box.Bilson, is heavy, it is clear, but without this project, I have more work. Thank you. I needed it. Well, I go back to work. I must insert a plank in the dark hallway of Bilson. You have understood me. So the tour is canceled and you really have lied to me. I think so. My two best friends have planted and I saw nothing. This tower was the dream job and it went up in smoke. I need a drink. Wait. If they canceled the project a month ago, why did I go every week to see the new working group? That was one of the most inspired designs of my career. I was so excited. Wait. It explains what happened to Louisa. Louisa. What can we do about it? Do not like you not understand. You feel the same. After all! No, it's not good! Damn, you're in the working group! Is there anything else you want to tell me? My lap of honor was bogus? Lying? False! Never lie to his friends. I should never have lied. Super. Very funny. It was horrible! You've just read a list of fish. It has nothing to do! I lost one month of my life to work on a dead project. I could have spent that time to find new contracts. Instead, I'll go tomorrow morning and probably get fired. Best Screenplay, my boss yelling at me going in front of everyone. Hello, lying bastards. No lies before I go to work to get fired? You're the devil. If it's a lie, it's really bad. And I will do what? Wait, what is a P.T.E.? What does that mean? It's horrible. Why have a special room to turn people? Leaving space dismissal, you get into what I call ""the Renaissance Corridor Quiet."" Here, an oval room of rest with psychological support. Right there, after the fountain of the New Departure. And here it is. Instead of a sad and gloomy cell, a protective womb... giving birth to a new life. Thank you. Absolutely. OK, I think this wall... What? But... I'm more about the project. Bilson fired me. Actually, I just resign. I can not work for large corporations with no heart. In selling me your ""working group"", I was the most inspired work of my career. In fact, you reminded me how my job could be fun when I'm not dealing with Bilson, so... I resigned. Yes, sir. But I have good benefits and I have made a great decision. I'll start my own box. Ultimately, I am grateful. After he proposed a career change, I made an impromptu presentation with a four-step approach that put him in the knee. Yeah."
1077,4,18,woman ,"Yes, and I also know that the draft of the new headquarters was abandoned last month. Nice try."
1078,4,18,,"Ted (2030): In spring 2009, I was hired to design a new headquarters for Goliath National Bank. And I hasten to add up to the plans of architect my paw. Ted (2030): There was a problem and his name was Bilson. Ted (2030): Bilson k*lled every one of my original ideas. Then one day the GNB has withdrawn from the project to create a new working group to oversee my plans. Everything changed at once. Ted (2030): Everything was fine until one day in the elevator. Ted (2030): Reluctantly, I agreed to design a room where people turn. But I was determined to put my key. Marshall, Lily and Barney: Yes!"

This game is all I have.And I nearly enough tickets for the remote controlled helicopter. Pity. You regret it. What shall I do? I'll tell you that Ted and I will do. We will introduce and apply the PQ everywhere. Ted, laser tag has no age limit. As the striptease in the West Midlle. No list of Murtaugh. There's nothing on this list for which you're too old. In fact, if you did everything on the Murtaugh list, I would call it a nice weekend. Challenge accepted. The next 24 hours, I will do everything on the list. And after that, you go to the PQ laser tag with me. I'll spend three hours listening to you talk about architecture. Come on guys, you do it! ""To pierce the ear. ""Done. Well, I go to a laundry at my mother. (Barney hand, then returned several hours later) Do you mind if I use your futon? Put it there, guys. It's on the list. ""Landing on the futon with a friend rather than going to the hotel. "" What, this? Just a quick foul '. Just a kid like me has to worry about. Then, ""pushing a medical"" on the list.

""Making an autoresponder message to two annoying.""Done. It will probably cost me a few appointments, but it's okay. It's good. New bet, then. If you can finish your list before me, we will cover the laser PQ and you pay toilet paper.Biodegradable and not this crap. I want up there forever. Bet held. I just had a little ""screw up my knee and it hurts"" incident. It... ""Helped to move the sixth floor walk against pizza and beer."" Ted Calls. I want to go. It answers? Hurry up, Robin. Come on, Ted. I was given aspirin and I do not think it was. No, he remains a. ""The beer funnel. "" No, no. Okay. You won, I hate it. I hate it. My back is k*ll*ing me. At the rave, I was mistaken for a cop. I have an earache so I can hear... I hear my own ear. Think about it. My clothes... What... Take that! I have redeemed you your best costume for twice its price. This is... $ 30. And throw the shoes. You won, Ted. I will not make anything of the Murtaugh list. I'm too old for this stuff. And then the hospital. Really?"

1082,4,19,father ,Sleep is for the winners. You go to bed when you get labeled. I give you two points for trying. But I take off two points because of your big head.

I was training. That's my little angels. You are luminous beings of light. Gender: joy joy! Because that's the point of playing, having fun. Everyone. This is a participation trophy, everyone has one. Marshall, they were in kindergarten. It teaches not basketball like that. Are you kidding? What kind of sociopath told you like that? Your father was hard on you. It's ugly, but you do not have to be like him. You can learn from mistakes. OK, enough. This is not how we will raise our children!And that's not how you gonna lead this team! In tomorrow's game, if you're anything but a teddy bear with the cotton candy and rainbows, I foudroierai gaze so hard that you bruise! The times I've found your internet history, it was a mere side! Is that clear? Is that clear? Do not look at me like that. Stop yelling at me! OK, but I'll do it my way too. With the guitar. They look different, the children, but make sure they feel surrounded. I understand that you like it not. I know, baby. Thank you. Yours is."

(He throws the basketball on a kid) you not being there! You fall! I will not attack, Lily. I attack this pervasive culture of failure. I have to toughen them if you want to win the match tomorrow. What? You not count... What interest not to do? How do you know... Lily, what were you doing with the team before I arrive? The point of playing is to win the trophy. And if you do not know who wins, wins the trophy? Everything that's Chinese to me. Sure. I learned that way. Come on, Dad. I'm tired. I'm trying. With my father, no mercy and I did not ask. I really need to call this guy. Continue stretching! Errors? Lily, result. The guy was successful. He taught me to be a winner. This is what I teach these kids. And besides, this is what I will do with our children. There are different... Yes, ma'am. What is ironic is that... I know I was a little hard on you, the last two days.And I apologize. Today, we will not think of victory. We'll go there and... have fun. Let them score easily. Now you're sitting. Great.Addison is not football. Do not shoot! Unless you find it funny, in this case, have fun though. It was not a foul, referee? No tone, Kenny. Good job. Thank you very much.See you later. Good job, guys. At least, there are no points, eh? No idea of the score. It could be 53-0. It could be something else.It's 53-0. You do not do anything wrong. It's great that you lost, because in life, no matter the effort you make, or how much you try, people give you things. Since graduation, jobs, promotions. No matter what you do on the ground, as... As you're having fun. I take it anymore! Your coaching is crazy! I'm sorry. But is what I can do it my way? There is a werewolf on the ground! It can not be legit. It was not a market, right? You're k*ll*ing me! You k*ll me outright! I beg you to put me in one. I love it. I worked hard. It's nice to be appreciated at its true value. Your way is perhaps not completely stupid."

You are banned for life! My great... you cause me problems since you joined this club. But damn... if this is not the best battle of PQ I've ever seen. You are returned... And right away.

Do not tell me you have never seen Mackleroy and LaFleur. This is the best action movie of all time Canadian. Mackleroy is a young Mountie whose horse is k*lled by evil Americans, and LaFleur, his old partner grumpy and Afro-Canadian, just buy a nice fishing shack in northern Alberta... What? It's still one-man band? Because it was crap. An agreement of honor! Are you sure you want to do that? You know how it is. There is no futon. What's the matter? I'm too old for this stuff. There's a side admirable in its way to remain young.Who wants to be old? It's not perfect, it's pathetic. You can not skip to the end.The best thing is the journey. And Robin. He watches football and I'm... Your ear begins to feel. Okay. It's good. You have your own list. A list of things that you are too young. Do all these things and tell me if you still want to be old. An agreement of honor! Or you helped steal the sixth floor. They were in a hurry and left the pictures. Okay. I call it. But it is 4:30 am. It will not be awakened. I have not called yet. As a manager, I threw in the towel. This bet is over.Your ear looks like a Danish pastry in a French breakfast. The Russian beer? I will take a bierofski. Bierofski. Got it?"

And by the way, too old for laser tag. Yeah, whatever. I added laser tag to the list of Murtaugh. It's hard to admit, but with age, we can do certain things.This is why I have this list, not to make the mistake of thinking that I can still make a sleepless night. Or eat a whole pizza in one sitting. Or put posters on the wall without a frame. Barney, you have more 18 years. If you did the whole list, you would die. It was not a challenge. And if you fail? It works for me. Robin, you do the honors? There's some pretty hefty on the list. Finally, do you really think Barney is going to get ear pierced? You got anything in your ear? It looks like the inside of a pumpkin after Halloween. OK, Barney? You seem to have a bad back. This guy. Life is a meal and old age, the dessert. I get so many worries about the future. Where will my career? Who will I marry? When you're old, you do not worry, because all this has happened before. You got pumps and a comfortable seat for the stairs. That's perfect. I thought that, too, you'll understand when you grow older. I hate to refuse, but you told me that the turkey was extremely thin, and see for yourself. What? Removes ""colonoscopy"" and ""sleeping with an old"", and is a cinch. Well, if I finished first, it's six hours of study of American architecture from the early 20th, and you can not ever do something in the list of Murtaugh. This is for your own good. ""Put on reading glasses. ""Done. ""Yelled the boy from the neighborhood. ""With pleasure. (Ted was about to leave when Robin and Barney come but this box) What happened to you? How did you do? 16 pm! Supper time. Got up at 4am... Done. Okay. ""Take time to answer the phone. "" Done. It happens. I found these weird Russian beers, in the basement. Yes, it's... a little hot. I hope this is not a problem. You know, yesterday I went to bed at 20h because it was on the list and I could not sleep... because it was 20h. So I watched Lethal Weapon. I still could not sleep, so I watched Lethal Weapon 2. And then 3. And in the middle of Lethal Weapon 4, I realized..."
1094,4,19,,"Ted (2030): The Murtaugh list was created around my 30th birthday. It all started with the beer funnel your uncle. Marshall:... two, one, chug! Ted (2030): In our 20 years, with each party, this funnel came out. And to our 30 years, none. Of course, at age 20, the day looked like this. (Marshall and Ted fight) But to our 30 years, the day looked like this. (Ted is sitting on the couch, the trash next to him) Then one day, in the suffering of the worst hangover of my life, I realized that one person in the world understood me: Detective Roger Murtaugh, played by Danny Glover in the masterpiece 1987: Lethal Weapon, known for his often repeated motto: Ted (2030): Stuff. He said, ""I'm too old for this stuff. "" Ted (2030): In fact, Marshall was to coach the basketball team's class Lily. He thought it was funny, but Lily was dizzy: training father. Ted (2030): The next morning, Barney woke up on the futon in the living room. Robin:... soon... Barney:... we... Ted (2030): Children, over time your Uncle Marshall rehashed the story this game hundreds of times. And in fact, children from the other team were older than one class. But harping on the story, they looked like that. Ted:... that Murtaugh kept repeating: ""I'm too old for this stuff,"" but every time he says, he changes his mind, made another movie, and stuff. What I'm trying to say is that... the toilet, age.Will cover the PQ laser tag. Ted (2030): Because they did not want to argue in front of children, your uncle and your aunt Lily Marshall had a telepathic conversation. Ted (2030): Was it the determination of Marshall, Lily of encouragement, or the magic combination of both, but in the second half, the disorganized group of little urchins... have actually made things worse. In fact, according to Uncle Marshall, in the second half, the other team had even grown.And one of them had changed into a werewolf. Ted (2030): When the final whistle sounded charitably, the score was, according to the estimate of Marshall, 118 to nothing. And even if they did not win, everyone, including the coach, received a trophy for participation. Ted (2030): Stuff. He said ""Stuff""."

I think about her all the time, I guess one day we will run towards each other in slow motion and I wear a suede jacket. No. Perhaps. Ever. I know not. Listen... I just need to get rid of that idiot PJ. If Lily was there, she would know how to get rid of him. You're not Lily. Lily is a diabolical puppet master, the subtle situations to achieve its ends.

I'm going to the toilet. I'll miss you. I still have to go, but I could no longer stay away from you. What? It's on what? Do you not feel anything? You're breaking up with me? Welcome Mosbius Designs. Listen... you're great. But I chose another job. This is for you. Robin, I hope this letter will offer a conclusion. You will really miss. I'll find something."
1105,4,20,robin ,"Yeah, sure. Anything you want. It's not work! I know you're nervous, but we must stop procrastinating. You've spent two days to choose the pen official Mosbius Designs. Who are you? What's going on? You're right next door! So now Ted is assisted to do nothing. Yes, the guide. This table just told me that you're an idiot. This idea of being a guide is to procrastinate the fact of calling customers. Okay, but PJ does not help. At noon, when you go to any walk of reflection, that leaves us time to spend together. Tell me, PJ, I have a question for you architecture.Ted's ass what taste? It's locked? Listen, PJ. And I want you to think seriously before answering. You tell me I can not go to the bathroom with me? Why does it excite me? When I leave the job, it is 5:30 am. Got an idea of guys I meet? So, you get up very early to discuss the European market? How is it? What productivity? You did not call a single customer. Seminar? This is our apartment. You let a cake on the counter, Mama's going to offer a slice. One more. I'll miss you too. It is driving me crazy. When PJ was working, he was sexy. The keeper of the key toilet. A sexy guy that says when you can go to the bathroom or not? It's the dream. I have to stop, right? I know not break. Listen... Dude, I know. Yes, it's just... It's not really... that, you know? I feel it. But friends and others. If this is what you want, I totally understand. Are you kidding? I took the key to the toilet without asking. Are you gonna do? Are you okay? Sorry? No one goes to the library, so you do not care of this type. And you must pick up the phone and call customers. You wanna talk drop? I described as the perfect guy ""funny, intelligent, passionate, ambitious."" And apparently, I just... ""In my apartment."" You thought that you would have understood, now? You can do it. It looks good. Now known as a real customer."
1106,4,20,ted ,"Come on. She will not like it. It's funny for the guys, not girls. For the guys. I told you so. Thank you. And thank you for letting me use the apartment. A little thing, do you mind to cut off the TV during labor? Sorry. It's just... I can not concentrate during the Wheel of Fortune... A penny saved is a penny, Helen! I've suggested! I removed the felt. I make fun of that? The felt is back. I would not refuse a cup of coffee. PJ is a great help. Install the desktop, create the Web site. And in return, I guide a young brilliant mind. I want you to go out today and... put your hands on the buildings. Okay? Sense the vibrations of the concrete. Listen to the stories that you tell the stones. And going to the cleaners. All right. I do not procrastinate. I just want everything to be perfect, right? I have only one test. You see? It is useful. No, I guide him. Ted Mosby? Hello? Hello, PJ. Where are you? You're never late.You're mounted on the Empire State Building? Listen to the old lady. She knows stories. Take your time. (Hangs up) Wait.""Ted Mosby House."" The call comes from within! (He opens the bedroom door and discovered Robin in bed with PJ) This is not the Empire State Building. You can not sleep with my assistant. I try to work here, me. How did that happen? Inspiration... do your work. There's billions of guys on Earth. Why do you sleep with him? First, I know Simulates-man, this is a good match.Second, it must stop! If you distract PJ, you lose productivity. Once launched the website, printed brochures, and the choice of games at the business seminar, I will call. Okay, until Robin sleeps with my assistant. Good news, PJ. The brochures just arrived. Great choice for coverage. I like that instead of one of my creations, you to choose that. You think so? Listen to PJ, the website is still not done.You're not even come to the seminar... In fact, I saw a sh**ting star... and you're late every day. Sorry, PJ. I must be concentrated. You're fired. You're fired. Stop. You've already tired of him. ""It's the dream""? The dream? As mentioned by Martin Luther King? My God, this is the worst break. Are you kidding? I was going to do my walk with wisdom. Want to go? And if I did not think the books? There is a history of architecture on a famous architect who designed the library. She was perfect. But every year, sinking a few inches into the ground. Obviously, the building was condemned. He forgot to take into account the weight of books. This box... it's just me. If I ever thought not to books? The more I delayed the launch of my box, the more it can remain a dream and not something that I screwed up. It's like if I quit before it began. Are you kidding? At 30, I had to have an insolent success, being married to the perfect woman, maybe a kid on the way. Instead, I'm just a guy sitting in his apartment, which is a competition look with his phone. And who loses. Hello, Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. I learn about your design needs, present or future. I looked confident? Great."

You make the long tail, but once inside, you hold on, hoping not to lose your keys. You can not. You must wait three days before calling.This is the rule. Sorry. Can you repeat that? I do not mean the I-fuck-ever. Jesus. Seriously. Jesus began this thing for three days. He waited three days to return to life. It was perfect. If he had waited one day we would not have known he was dead! They would have said: ""Jesus, are you? ""And Jesus would probably have said,"" You okay? I died yesterday! ""And they would say:"" You have the air alive, man. "" And they should explain his resurrection. And the miracle. And then the guy would say, ""Okay, whatever you want, dude."" And he will not come back on a Saturday. Everyone is busy doing chores. Weave, cut the beard. No. It looked exactly the right number of days... Three. And it's Sunday, they are all already in the church.They are all there, ""No, Jesus died."" Then, bam! He burst through the door, crossed the aisle, everyone is excited. And by the way, that's where he invented the ""tope there! ""3 days.We wait three days to call a woman because it is the time that Jesus wants us to wait. True story. What? We knew he would try to call three days before, so I took his cell phone and changed his number from mine. ""Piti texting""? Yeah. Or... it pretends to Holly and we are in the bath. It should. Or... it is said that red is our favorite color and found the look ""cowboy"" sexy. He put the boots! Or... we remove our shirts. Maybe that door below, a black bra with lace. It is hot. Too! Tell him we slowly drag our... What do we do? The crazy eyes, ""I'm going too fast and I will f*ck up everything."" We all know what it gave. And it's coming. It shows all the telltale signs. ""You like architecture? We should get married. Ha-ha.MDR. Just kidding. So what? "" ""I like beer. We should go to Germany. MDR. JP.MDR. "" ""My parents divorced two years there. It was really hard. MDR. "" And then we met Stan. A guard who works nights. And he had not finished. No matter. It's OK. Well, if Ted does not say, I will. I love you. How is this possible? It's all there waiting! All was well until he sends a text message for Lily and ruins everything. Yes. (Barney out of the bar) Or... That's it, man. This is the ""I love you."" Stan. What? ""I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend. "" Easy. You? He speaks clearly to me. Okay, one: It has never been proven. Two: If anyone had any dreams about gays one of us would be on me! Finally, look at me. Now look at you. An octogenarian still in her closet would not be in this state. I train every day. One thing we know about Ted is that he likes a nice body. This body would vibrate. I know. It's weird. Crazy, no? Ted had dreams about me gay. You can tell us. This is a secure area. No more dreams? Nothing disturbing or erotic? Machines force you. They want to watch. That's how they erupt. And also, it was really funny. You work right? What... Yeah, it will be fun! Look, I'm kidding! It explodes! Do you like magic?"

We wanted to call the chopper too early, but then he... sent text messages. Poor, little Ted. It should... He should say it estnous. It's better. It was funny. He should say that it is us. It's better. He bluntly put! It was great! But it's time to tell him that he wears. It's better. I believe that wearing anything underneath. There, he wears only cowboy boots! Here we go! I think we'll... have s*x with Ted. No, actually it was for his good. It protects it from itself. He really likes this girl. He had that look. The same he had with you the first time. It's been that Ted did not like someone. He stored much... We thought him to say ""I love you"" when he contacted her. First: he jokes with the marriage. Deuzio: it's far too early suggestions crazy travel. Third: it says too early personal things. Yeah, but that's the problem. Ted did not say ""I love you"" as easily as we thought. So, he explained everything and once finished, there was something fascinating. He eats here every day. Far from it. It's... really nice. You want me to send it to Ted. I knew it. I do not know... what comes to the bread here, but it touches me... here... and here. It is perhaps not in love with us. I do not understand men. Do... you come back? He replied! ""I probably should not tell you, finally, we barely knew, but never mind, I say it anyway. "" I would like Stan to be there. ""I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend."" Ted Why send text messages to a girl he barely knows, where he says he dreams about me gay? Dude, I'm his best friend. That's the trick. I hug you, no. Who would not want to cuddle in this case, on Sunday morning? Wrapped in the quilt while it is raining, and there are muffins in the oven. I'm cuddly, bitch. You must do. Ted and I, we lived. I know what he likes. There are things I can do it... he époustoufleraient Why do they sleep with Ted? And by ""me"", he means Marshall Eriksen, star of Ted's gay dreams. Look at this guy. How is my best friend for 12 years? Your feelings are quite natural. That's it? OK, what do you say that. You know that someday in the future, machines will rebel? So, the machines... k*lled everyone. And there are only you, me, and Barney. Who among us would you... you? Sorry. It was just trying to help you. Great! We can have fun! Wait. You can not just sit there and have your date with us?"

This is Holly who writes to you? You're not promised to wait three days? Okay, just try to proclaim your sound of the naked girl. Really? Whatever it is, I guarantee you she do not wear it. She lies to please you. Because no woman in history has never, ""asked to read architectural magazines in my old... uniform cheerleader. "" What? ""Baby, I got to eat at Generro. I come home soon.

Father or a really sick... Right? Sorry. Hi guys! What is it? Bizarre. Holly sent a message to Ted talking about a meal Generro. A second. Band of bastards! You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you? You did this all day? This is wicked. What? I was a single case. This is not Holly Robin Scherbatsky. What is wrong with her hair? News Flash: detangling, it exists for not having a helmet. I'm so mean. And he really knows not what means MDR. Super Stan. Who is it? That guy you fell in love. I hope his girlfriend is not jealous. He spoke of a friend or...? It's okay. It's over now. I have to leave, but that's what happens: you call it now, tell him what you did and apologize.Got it? Really? How she explained the scope of texting? Marsha and Billy. They are not trampled. You cling to Barney and Marshall. They did not believe that you'd wait three days, so Barney has changed his number by that of his work laptop.Holly is Barney and Marshall. I think they have done that. They were just at the bar. Yes, it was them. I know. You should tell them that you are not fooled. I see. Why not: ""I have told anyone yet, but I only have three months to live""? I love this thing someone said about three months to live. It's good, but I think it comes down to trick the three months to live. So what? So Ted has gay dreams about one of you. It's not as if he had three months to live. It would... Shocking, no? Yes. You know their names? No, it's Marshall. Married to Lily."
1113,4,21,stan ,"Why do you so much noise? Why not say you know it's there, thinking of you, concerned about you, and you feel safe? Your fears, your past disappear. And that the only hope is the promise of a hug. I thank God for every mistake I made, because each of them told me the path that led me to you. Hug me all night. Stroking my hair. Tell me I'm a woman and show me that you are a man. Until there is now. You and me... and now. This is Pablo Neruda. That's cool. Still nothing? I go to work.

What? That's not true. Sorry, Lily. It's a breast. To call. Texting, it's different. I make no noise. Holly just told me what she wears. It's pretty exciting. How do you know? Okay, maybe she's lying on the architectural magazines.No. This is bad. She just sent me a message clearly intended for someone else. Come down. I wear them right now and they are very sexy. I'm in love with you. Holly explained everything to me, it was just a misunderstanding. All is well now. Apparently, his idiot friend of Marsha accidentally used his phone for a message to her husband Billy. And now I feel better than ever. It sounds crazy, but I think that I am attached to this girl. What? Wait. It was them all along? So Holly was not in his bath?Or sitting by the window, gazing at the stars thinking of me? Or on his couch cheerleader reading architecture magazines? It's true. Incredible! Or... I send them a text message that will really confuse them. Not bad. And: ""I k*lled a man with a shovel, and those feelings resurface""? ""I've never told anyone but I slept with the mother of my best friend. "" Wait. I think I have. It's a bit weird, but... I had a strange dream yesterday. It's a bit embarrassing.

Of course. And.. why should I ""make me"" one of you? It's hard. I imagine it would be... Holly. Robin told me everything. That's why I invented everything. Guys, here is Holly. And I have not waited for your precious three days to call. I knew where she was working so I found. Let me ask you? It was too early? Holly and I are going to dinner. I do not need help, OK? I can look after myself. And yes, maybe some girls do not like to be called away or they may say too, but guess what? These are not good for me. Maybe the good is the one that loves me to do that, because... this is who I am and I will not change because of a stupid rule of the Three Days. Holly spells his name with an ""I""."

By pressing send, I realized that it was not at all charming. That was the thing that sucks the most anyone has told someone. And the worst with texting, is that once sent... can not recover them. And then...(23 minutes later...) you wait. And just when you decided to never again send a text message... (His phone rings) ""I thought you too, it's crazy that you send me a text when I'm in my bath."" Ted (2030): Holly and I, we had sent text messages until 2am.And all the next day, too. It seemed perfect. Ted (2030): And I wasted half an hour of life of these bastards, tell them about this dream where I dine with my top 5 best architects. Ted (2030): I had proved that the Rule of Three Days was wrong and I went out to dinner with a pretty girl. And so far, I have told anyone the truth about this hot date. Ted (2030): Finally, I did not have to wait three days, but Holly should really have. Like many rules, sometimes you follow them and sometimes not. But I will say this.

Where? Where was your meal? What? Why do you not tell me where you got your intoxication? It makes sense. Do not say anything. This Indian restaurant where the cat jumps on the tables? The Spanish restaurant with the cradle? Is it here? Tell me! Why do you have told me? Schlegel's? Thank you! I'll have to find another New York place that serves bagels. ""What does your paintball on your personality? "" ""The last 3 kilos: how the push to lose. "" Petra Petrova. These magazines are broken. It is certainly retouched. You are my hero! Really? How did you do? Of course it is. Marry them! It. The 200th with that... get laid? Even if I was wearing protective clothing. 200 is too much! Who are these girls? It was rhetorical. Show me the list. 200 is too much. That's too! Who said so? I think he'll say it again very slowly. are you gonna do? You will find not a partner in the next 2 hours. Where did Barney? It's been over an hour. It has happened to you what? Why wait till then? Congratulations! Go! Happened to you at 200. You should be proud. You should be tested, but you should be proud. We do not care if Pauline does not pose in bikinis in magazines. Any visual representation of data. Mosbius Designs. They were thrown. That's an intervention. You could not stop eating, so we threw your cam. You make tables work? Damn. Not move. I bring them. I'm sorry, Milt? I think these are my paintings. This is my blanket. We'll see later. But I need these tables. Okay, how? I give you five dollars. No one will pay a million for these pictures! OK, Milt, you won. I will give one million. The problem is that the distributor... The alien time machine has a withdrawal limit. That's what I'll do. I give you a dollar... per day... for a million days."

1129,4,22,woman 1, Get out.
1130,4,22,woman 2, You're scary.
1131,4,22,woman 3, I have a mass and I love to use it.
1132,4,22,,"Ted (2030): In May 2009, I was about to have my first big client as an independent architect. I was desperate for this to happen. Ted (2030): Everything. Ted (2030): Children, I tell you the story of meeting your mother. There is so much to learn from this story and it is most important. The greatest moments in life, it is not always what you do. This is also what happens to us. I'm not saying you can not influence the course of your life. You must act and you will. But remember that one day you could put one foot out and see your life changed forever. (He gives money to a homeless man) You know, the universe has a plan, children, and that plan is still moving. A butterfly flaps its wings... and it starts raining. (He opens his umbrella) It's scary. But it is also wonderful. All these workings of the machine running constantly, ensuring that you are exactly where you should be, exactly when you should be. The right place... (Someone taps him on the shoulder) at the right time. Ted (2030): Children, it's a miracle I've been at this corner.Especially since it would have been easy I'm not there. Ted (2030): For example, when leaving the apartment, I almost go right instead of left. Why not right? For that, we must go back. As you know, your Aunt Robin had a show. Barney, entering: Go to YouTube. Tape ""Robin Scherbatsky show vomit"". Robin, already gone. Ted (2030): The children, though as usual, I had gone to Schlegel's Bagels, I would have gone right. I would have taken a bagel would be returned to work on this building and you would perhaps never been born. But I went left, towards my second favorite place. And the rest is history. Of course, on the way, I stopped in this booth. Why I got arrested? That's why. Ted (2030): So, bagel on the way, I stopped a minute in a booth to see the photo of the 200th Barney. If I had not done that, I would have missed the cut by the booth and came 77th in this corner a minute earlier. I would have had the bagel, worked a little, and you children, you would not be born. Why I cut through the 77th and gave a dollar to the homeless? That's why. In the early days of Marshall to Goliath National Bank... Ted (2030): If I had not bought these tables for Marshall, I would not be passed by the 77th to give Milt his dollar. In short, you know the rest. And now, children. There are lots of little reasons that great things happen to us. If I knew then that these things take me and how I shall be grateful to them, I probably would have done something like that. Ted (2030): The next day, Uncle Barney finally confronted Matthew Panning, the stud of the school of Port Richmond."
1133,4,23,barney ,"Well played, sir. I would say even more. You, sir, did think Stella. ""Ted looked so cool now. Do I chose the wrong? ""Wait a week. The bush on the back. And belly. Have you felt that? There was an earthquake ""Tope-there"". It's a very big check. IF big, that if you sleep with, you would not tell your friends. A very big check! Okay. Today, I had a $ 200 fine for speeding. You can not blow a fine. I would have done that too, if I went to a barbecue.Slim, I went there. You think I can not blow a fine? You think I can not blow my fine? I am Barney Stinson, master of manipulation. If I managed to make me pay for a stripper to dance, I can blow a fine. Challenge accepted... wait. Let's go. Of course, officer. On. So, what's good? $ 375! And he kept the gift certificate. Emilio and I'll call him tell him to shorten the crotch. Anything, Robin. Like you've already blown a fine. Excuse me. I left something in New Jersey. Come on. Mr. Officer, please, my wife is having a baby! She just lost the waters! She took the other car. It's Italian leather, so... I... go... OK, you can do it. You can do it! You can do it. Licensing and registration papers. You must have a permit to be as pretty. And this body? I imagine that something as explosive must be registered with the authorities. Why, am I under arrest? When will you understand the difference between my life and a porno is that my life has better lighting. I'm not lying! I swear on my mother. I swear Goliath National Bank. I swear on my costumes. I... do... mens... not. It's me! This is Barney. With the help! I have big problems! I imagine that something as explosive must be registered with the authorities. Why, am I under arrest? No, my wife will give birth! I have a sausage with your name! You must come to Brazzaville, in New Jersey to take me out. Come on. You have no idea what kind of criminals with whom they put me. Save me, Ted! By the way, how's the girl you see? This superb French with huge tits? The highest good of all those with whom you're never out! Ever! She was found two days later, in the directory. I've never put my name in my underwear. You're back! It's good to see you, Lily. I'm in a world of amnesia with lots of pictures of my son and an alliance. I will find the best woman / woman and we will..."

1135,4,23,lily ,"When listening to this joke of peanut butter and jam, I was completely disgusted. But this morning in the shower, I thought about it and it made me laugh. Peanut butter. So I think I could win. According to Marshall. Thank you. So what's new? OK, that's enough for tonight. I'll go slowly."
1136,4,23,lookalike stella, Magic.
1137,4,23,man ,"Yes, that's fine. You will do a good job. My concern is the basement. Especially the laundry. I want a laundry room of 5 x 5 meters, ceramic tiles stain-resistant floor to ceiling. I am a man who likes to do his own laundry, and sometimes it's messy. steel chains hanging from the ceiling 3 meters. This is where my bags of laundry will be hung for three days and three nights before I... cleans. One last point, soundproofing. I tend to make much noise when I wash. I'll show you. I'll go in the laundry room and tell me if you hear me."
1138,4,23,marshall ,"Well done. You know, Ted has played cool, that's exactly what he should do. In fact, I would say on a scale of... I think you've been great. Tony is rich? Tell me that you wrote a check. Tell me that you did a very big check. So big that he not remove his shirt to go swimming. It's a very big check. It's... What do you mean ""no thank you""? You'd be a great teacher. You are an expert, you can talk, and when necessary, you can get to grow a beautiful beard. That sucks, dude. You did not manage to blow it up? I have done. It was... when? In 1998. There is no fire. In fact, you know, there's a fire in the barbecue where I go. Nothing special. Burgers, chops...merguez. Yeah, merguez. My mother's marinated in beer for 2 days. That's it. It's weird, I could have sworn that what those big, succulent smoked sausages had writing on it. Bizarre.You were saying? It said: ""Ownership of Minnesota police, Jorgensen.""You like merguez, Jorgensen agent? It's all in the assessment of your enemy. I knew he loved the sausages because he was out of breath just by coming to my car and he had mustard on his holster. Are you kidding? Robin is a pretty girl. They have no fines. I bet she was often stopped and has never had. Gruesome? You can not do it! It's from a porno. I saw him. Shit, I did."
1139,4,23,police ,"Driver and vehicle registration. Driver and... Pardon? Exit the vehicle. No. It depends on what you will do me. Get out. Yes, I did a search. You have 15 offenses of the past three days. Exit the vehicle. Get out!"
1140,4,23,policeman ,"Where's the fire? You know it's dangerous to go... You said ""sausages""? That was writing what? The merguez? You go to this address? Follow me with the siren.It will burn red lights. Sir, this is a gift certificate for a custom Italian suit. Permits and... Sweetie. No, do not cry. OK, not fine for you. Drive slower next time, OK? Where is your wife?"
1141,4,23,robin ,"""What a nice surprise""? No, a nice surprise would have been a safe falls from 40 stories e crushes them both. You let yourself do? You're f*cked up. He f*cked up, right? What? So big, that when you sit next to on the plane, you wonder if the check would not have had to buy two seats. Handling a police officer with your sausage. It's sexy. You're wrong about that, man. This is outrageous! And relevant. Thank you. How was your lunch with the rich? It started well. Ted, it looks like this guy asks you to design... That's it. A house of horror. You can not do this house! You did break Tony and Stella? Really sorry, but I must insist that you topes there. I'll wait. False. This has never happened. You're lying."
1142,4,23,stella ,"I do too. I made a terrible mistake. Bluntly. Ressortons lie down together and much more. Tony left me. He said it was because of what you said. Look, Ted, I was 7 months late, but that's how. I'm in love with Tony, since high school. We went out for a long time, and then... I became pregnant and for a 19 year old daughter, it was too much to handle, and it broke. And for a long time, I too thought about my role as mother. I forgot Tony. I forgot...what it was like being in love. Then you came and everything was resurrected. And I loved you for that. I loved you so much, in fact, it was just... enough. But I always liked Tony. Can you talk to Tony? He'll listen. You made him change his mind. You can do it again. It is cruel to ask that... I do not know what else to do. I love it. Tuck, Mrs. Matsen! I can not do anything to fix everything? You pay the toll, eh? I laugh. Again, sorry for everything. Actually... Really? That is correct. It's a little silly, but yes. I've already told you that I avoided a PV? I was at my parents by doing 130 and I was arrested.The cop comes out of his car. He struts around a bit to me like, ""Girl, I've waited all day. ""Then I looked and I said,"" Sorry, Mr. Officer. I came as fast as I could. "" An old joke. I know you're tired of waiting and may require you to wait a little longer, but it happens, Ted. And it happens as fast as she can."
1143,4,23,ted ,"Stella! Glad to see you again! And Tony! What a nice surprise. We had a friendly discussion and we resumed our respective paths. I am not on the back. Or stomach. I want to move forward.And it was an important step towards that. The future. I know. I'm better than you. Sold! No, between. It's not weird at all. Sad? No. I think what you call sorrow was only... jovial nonchalance. Why are you here? I met lots of girls. I switched to running a small business. This is the lung of the economy. Yeah! He has not signed a check. A job? No thank you. I will not be a professor. That's what you do when your career is in trouble and you have to pay the bills. Manager of small business. The lung of the economy. I will not take this job, okay? I'll get through. New topic. I understand. ""Ack-Ted. ""I understood. What now? Tony, I do not need your help. Now that's a very big check. I want to design a home that showcases the landscape without dominating. IN 1935, when Frank Lloyd Wright designed the house to the waterfall... The laundry room? Gruesome. A deadly house. The steak is very rare. Do not you? It's a bit serious, huh? I will not do. I will not do it! Stop! I do not want your help, OK? You did not do that. Why? Let me reassure you. I do not want to Stella. She lied to me, dumped me at the altar. Who can do that? I'm better off without her. It is all yours, buddy. Stella? Tony left you? Let's talk in the hallway. Why are you here? No, it's not what happens. Tuck, Mrs. Matsen. Delighted to have you review, Stella. What? Yes, it's cruel to ask it. You love her? What, you do call my romance? It's your strategy? Because this guy is gone. You can have me over like that. I am attached to nothing, thanks to you. Enter! Enter! No. Slow down. What's going on? I'm a little busy. You wanna do something for me? I have to go in New Jersey. You talk about Claudette? She is fine. I talk to Tony. I want you to be happy. I will speak to him. Just tell me one thing. Why Tony? I mean, it's money, pajamas kung fu? Finally... What is it? Good. I will say out loud something that I had managed not to say out loud. Have you, Tony and you... That at one point I thought I had with you... I know that Marshall and Lily... I want that. I want to. I keep waiting and waiting for that to happen and... I guess I'm just... tired of waiting. And that's all I have to say about it. Really? Really?"
1144,4,23,tony ,"Enchanted. Hi, Ted. I knew it was wrong to steal someone's girlfriend. I got used to it. I could not sleep. And for the wrong reasons.Sometimes for good reasons. Stella and I, we had not seen for five years, so you can imagine, at first it was fast and intense.Broken lamps, furniture moved. You see this bald area?Regardless, we turned the page. Me, Lucy, Stella, we would be moving to LA I was going to become a screenwriter. Then, you have been crossed, and you looked so... sad. You're wrong, OK? As a small dachshund with back pain who should be walking in a bag. I know I can be a bit harsh, but I can not bear to have you as many wounded. Fate put me in the street to fix it.Obviously, I can not fill the crater left by Stella in your heart. And I know you've been fired. No. Ted, my family has a lot of money. And I want to use that money to fix it with you. Ted, I want to offer you a job. Every year, my family gives a lot to Columbia University, I have contacts. How would you like to design... You wanna be an architect? Super. A guy I was in school wants a new home. The job is yours if you want. That's his job. By practicing martial arts, I learned to believe in my instinct and my instinct tells me that... it sounds great. Grave well. You hit the nail. Sorry for this house of horror. It was my fault. It is for me.New plan. My friend, you will build a husband to the Statue of Liberty. I have some knowledge in the town hall. Yes Because... when you were with Stella, I missed her terribly. I can imagine how you feel. Okay. A weight less."
1145,4,23,,"Ted (2030): Children, Stella was the girl I thought to end my life. Before she left me on the altar, breaking my heart. So, when I cross seven months later, I had only one thing to say. Ted, crying: And I kept your sweater... and sometimes, I sit in the bathtub for hours, you know, feel it. Marshall:... up... Ted, with a lookalike Stella: It's my new bride. This is Stella, except that it is French and, as you see, she has enormous breasts. Ted (2030): And you know, I meant it. But anyway, that night, my mind wandered. Ted (2030): My heart jumped. A new library? A conservatory? Tony:... your own resume as professor of architecture. Ted (2030): And that was all. Tony is gone and I started to put it all behind me. Finally, I thought. Woman, leaving her: Take it back on, darling. He's sorry. Ms. Matsen: Come on, darling, kiss me! Stella, shouting: Tuck, Mrs. Matsen! Ted (2030): He lied. That's what really happened. Ms. Matsen: Come on, darling, kiss me! Ted (2030): So, Stella and I went to New Jersey, to release your uncle Barney and we went home. Ted (2030): And I did. I know what I told him, but he had to change his mind because the next day they went to California.Stella opened a new office. And against all odds, Tony became a successful writer. His film, ""The Bride"" was a hit. But we will come back."

1147,4,24,barney ,"What are you doing? It's time to talk? What do you think of Robin? Awesome. Say that is a tailor and you have found a nice suit. A nice suit Canada. Superb chest. You try it, but it does not suit you perfectly. So you return it. Then I try it. I'm not too keen... a suit that you have caught the eye, but at the same time, I love this costume. But Ted, remember your answer, because... The costume is Robin. I know! Okay? Now. For I have explained. Forget it. It really is not class. At best, it sucks. Owl. How do we go? We will do what? Jump? Actually, it's not bad. Look, Robin... I must tell you something. What is it? It's been an incredible thing. I was talking to Robin, I would tell him my feelings, but just before, you will believe what ever she said. In your opinion? What we can say to that? Robin, you're great listening. You're really great, but we're friends. This is not a good idea. You too, sweetie. Once she told me that, more than feelings. I'm more in love. It's not great? Tracey, tell Lily what you just said. No, how you've arrived there. Come off the bus from Iowa! How lucky that apprentice... dancer off the bus from Iowa... meeting... the producer of the Rockettes? You can make us one of those rum and beer, that your father loves so much? What? What song? There was a piece? The costume is Robin. I know! Okay? Now. As I explained... So... when she said love me, she meant... otherwise. Yes. It's true. And it's great. It's great. (Tracey returns) So Robin does not like me. Why? So... You're in love with me? You can stop. Lily told me everything. I can not believe it. Maybe I will not avoid it. I am perhaps. I have not wanted for a long time. But with you, it does not look so...difficult. I know not. I thought... you felt the same. It's going pretty fast, do not you think? We're good friends. Why risk everything? Friends? My God. You just do it again. You've mosbysé! But if, little flirtatious. Why are you scared to try? Bad idea. No. Friends. I love you. No, you're smothering me. You know what? We'll see later. Yeah, right."

Everyone! Ted, are you? What? You said what? What? You were in love with her, throughout the year and when she feels the same, you love him more. Honey, you're there. You're really there. Damn. Everyone always says, ""Do not tell Lily. Lily can not keep a secret. ""And, usually, they are right. But this time I kept the secret.

Architecture is k*ll*ing you and it kills us to see her k*ll you.You're like the goat with the mop. You want it so much, and whenever the world try to get the resume, it hooks you. But you know what? This is only a wimp. Why do you want? In the crapper, the plan. I wanted to be a famous artist.Marshall wanted to be environmental lawyer. Robin wanted to be a TV reporter. It continues? Bravo. Barney wanted to be a violinist. Need not tell me. You can not draw your life as a building. It does not work like that. You must live it and draw it to itself. Look what the world tells you to do and took the leap. A metaphorical leap. A metaphorical leap! Honey, you did it! It's true! No, not at all!"

Just put wide doors and chairs strengthened. Birthday beer on the roof. Let's go! What? We brought you a surprise party, last year.Thou shalt have no surprises on two holidays. The fact that the world has come to the first was surprising. Not? Two surprises on Christmas! It is very strong! It is very strong! Great!(Marshall goes on the roof) Super... It still will not mount. Yes, Robin, I know. This festival is... is... a disaster.It was my idea. I take responsibility. There is one thing to do. Lily, I have to! (He stands on the edge of the roof) It's useless to procrastinate. You know who knows how to live? These people. It looks to be a... sacred... spa. I can jump it. Really? Look. Do not worry. If I can jump tonight, it will save the evening. When Evel Knievel rode his rocket star on the shore of Snake River Canyon, you think his wife said ""Honey, come down here '? No need to remind me. Sorry, but I have to. Why? My God! My God, really? I saw you look fat... This is the permission I needed. It is. It... is... go! It is. Bravo, Lily. I mean, what a b*mb. Who saw this coming? 7 months and 29 days. Really? OK, first... Second, there is a trick you can try. It's risky, but it can pay off. Lack of anything better, I'll call it... The Mosby. It could squarely mosbyser. Do you remember your first time with Ted? You wanted to get on the train Ted, visit his yard. What changed everything? You're really pretty, but abnormally high and you will not believe in ghosts. I was about to jump. You've not heard saying ""OK"" loop? It's good. Sorry, everyone. Lily does not want me jumping. (He descends from the rim) Thank God. You got beat by a girl. I'll tell you, I will eat more chops. I will not eat.. never... chops! Before Ted! You're right. You're completely right. I love you, Lily. I did it! I can do anything! I bought a motorcycle! OK, sorry. Come on, guys."

Have fun. Shit. You know since when? And you've said anything since? Bravo. You know since when? I will do what? I'll marry Barney in a large church. We'll move to New Hampshire and open cottages. No! This is Barney. I mean... This is Barney. But it's Barney. I have to say no. You're right. For the first time he likes a girl, she pushes him away? And not just any girl. It's going to destroy it. The Mosby? What is the Mosby? I was ready to jump the turnstile. What? The Mosby! It's great! And... excuse me. What? Yes. Much. Damn, Lily! It's just... You mean to me, Barney. And... This kind of stuff, the emotional side. This is not your type. I thought you avoid that. Maybe. I know not. I am not good to face the feelings.There is clearly something... between us. Maybe my head said, ""stifles it in the bud"" because my heart said... something else. Listen... I feel for you. Maybe even that I love you. What? Friends. But no. You're right. I've just mosbyser. Because I'm afraid of how I could love you. You're right. There must be a mistake. I love you. Friends, then.

Buy the costume. It is important to you. Tell him how you feel. I'm with you. What... Impossible, the presentation is tomorrow. These hats are not alone. Why do you want as I go on the roof? You made me a surprise party? Recently, you need two tries to get up from the couch.You can not skip it. Really. Right? She's here, Lily. She looks at me. The goat. It's a wuss. Not food. (He takes the mop in the bathroom and closes the door behind him) How...? I'm with you. What... I think I love you. Mr. Goat? (He tries to open the bathroom but the door is closed) M. The goat? Enough. (He manages to enter) Crazy Goat. I do not understand your fascination with this mop. It should be normal with a brain the size of a... The hospital! It happened... you left a wild animal in our apartment. I've been attacked. ""The sweetest and adorable goat in the world""? It's the goat jumped on me! Can I go? Great, I'm late for my presentation. Thank you, Mr. Goat. There he is, gentlemen. Rib Town. Is it not? Is it not? What? Sven... It's a disaster. How I will recover? What does that mean? Because I have to be an architect. This is... That's the plan. So what, I should do anything?"
1155,4,24,tracey ,What I just arrived in New York? I just get off the bus from Iowa. I believe in a classic story of showbiz. Of course!
1156,4,24,,"Ted (2030): Each architect has a building that changed his career. For me it was to my 31st birthday. It was not a museum or a concert hall or a skyscraper. It was something else. Ted:... hat cowboy. Listen, I need this job. I have no other option. Ted (2030): The next three days, I worked as ever. And it led me... nowhere. Ted (2030): I should explain. A few years earlier... Ted (2030): The terrace of the building next door. A paradise waiting for us behind a pit of 2 or 3 meters. And the best... Ted (2030): But he did not jump. Ted (2030): And the following years, he continued to try. But each time, without exception... He did not jump. Ted (2030): I have already told you some of the history of the goat. Ted (2030): When Aunt Lily a farmer invited to speak to his class how he brought the goat, and told the class what he would do later. How Aunt Lily, in a fit of kindness, bought a goat to commute his sentence. Ted (2030): I lacked sleep, it was certainly not like that, but that's how I remember it. Ted (2030): It was a long and crazy night, but in the morning, against all odds, I made my presentation. Ted (2030): This is the year that I was left at the altar. The year I was a bartender tared Knocked The year I got fired. The year I got beat by a goat. A girl goat, and more. Yet it was the best year of my life. Because if this had not happened, I never had the best job of my life. But most importantly, I would not have met your mother, because as you know... It was in this class.Of course, this story is just beginning."
1157,5,1,a boy," Yeah Ted, we're supposed to learn from you? You failed as an architect.  Economics?"
1158,5,1,a girl, Architect?
1159,5,1,another boy," And if you're a professor, where's your hat and your whip?"
1160,5,1,another girl, And where are your pants?
1161,5,1,barney ,"Yeah, Lily, listen. Robin's more than just awe-""some."" She's awe-""quite a bit."" She's awe-""a whole darn lot."" Oh yeah. Yeah, It's us. You understand, right? That, my friend, is the Dominator 8000, the best bullwhip on the market, according to my whip guy. Yeah, I have a whip guy. You're still seeing that guy? I should go, too. I hooked up with this Chinese girl last night and I don't know, it's weird. I already feel like seconds. All summer. Girlfriend? Yeah, yeah. Yes, we should. Or. Or... Yes, we do. Or. Or... Yeah, the talk sucks. You have to, like, talk. And be all, ""I don't know. Well, that and the fact that elaborate lies really turn us on. Or. Or... Ted, now's not a good time. Where do you keep your condoms? Okay, look, mistake number 1 was taking that girl's question. You don't take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Mistake number 2 was you should've hit that. Dude, your pants were already off, you had a classroom full of people to cheer you on, and you can't knock her up 'cause it's a dream. Class dismissed. Exactly. Amen. Run tell that. Yes! No! Lily, private convo time. Lily, can't you just let us be happy? And that's not happy? Why? Give me one good reason. Waow, You can't even think of one. Headlights. Dear. Lily, for the last time, things with me and Robin are as good as they can possibly be. Oh, hey, look, Brad's here. Hey Brad. We're not gonna have the talk. Thank you, Ted. What?! How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend? Simple, the rules for girls are the same as the rules for gremlins. Gremlins. Rule number 1. Never get them wet. In otherords, don't let her take a shower at your place. Number 2. Keep them away from sunlight. I.E. Don't ever see them No, Ted. Brunch is not cool. Simple. Remember in the movie Predator... I've done all three of those things with Robin. Is she my girlfriend? Hey Brad! Brad, we can't fight like this all night! We both got some good shots in. Let's call a truce! Wow, wow, wow, Girlfriend? Hey, come on. A bit strongly. She's not my girlfriend. Because of that? Come on. That's my thing. I'm always punching guys. Girls... I'll punch a baby. I don't care. Hey, sorry I went little too far last night. No, I meant punching Brad. No. We are not having the talk! Never take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Also, don't look right here (showing girl's boobs). Okay, good luck. Byesies. (from Robin's room) Hey, Ted, door five! Were you there? Fine. But how do these things even work? What do we say? I know, right? I don't know. I mean, it's not like I don't like you. I just haven't had a girlfriend Maybe we should go back to being just friends. Good. Me, neither. We're not good at being friends. We're not good at being in a relationship. What are we good at? I don't know. If we're gonna do it again, I'm gonna need some Gatorade... And Robin's my girlfriend. I know it sounds nuts, but it feels good to say. And if the alternative is not being together, then it's worth taking this risk 'cause... she's awesome. She can handle her Scotch. And she's my girlfriend. Hook, line, and sinker. We are good. You know, brunch actually does sound kind of good. Flugelhorn?"
1162,5,1,barney and robin," Wow, wow..."
1163,5,1,blond girl," Yeah, here's my question, ""Ted,"" who the hell do you think you are?  I'm sorry to bother you, Professor Mosby, but this isn't Architecture 101. This is Economics 305. You're in the wrong classroom."
1164,5,1,brad ," I've got two tickets to the Rangers/Canucks game tomorrow night. I know you're a hockey fan, so I was thinking... What do I have to do? Put a g*n to your head? Buy you a six pack? Why not? You have a boyfriend? Great! It's a date. Hey Barn! Not really. Oh, man. Is this the talk? No, this is good. Let's get it all out of the way. Robin, I'm looking for something serious. But before we go any further, you should know something about my stuff below the belt. I was born a little different. You and Barn... oh, so you guys are... Sounds like you guys need to have the talk. Okay, how about this. If you kiss me, and you feel bad about it, you're meant to be with Barney. It's okay, dude. I shouldn't go kissing some other guy's girlfriend."
1165,5,1,lily ,"Whoo!!! Sorry. (slower) Whoo! It's just they kissed! They're finally a couple. Oh, my God, you guys! This is our first double date! First of millions! What if our kids get married?! Oh I love this! Wait, what are you saying? Is it something I did? Sure, of course. As long as you're happy, I'm happy. We were gonna take cooking lessons together and we were gonna go on camping trips together and then we were gonna sit around telling funny stories about our cooking lessons and our camping trips. Whoo!!!!!! So, how long has this been going on? I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! You guys are boyfriend and girlfriend. You've been together all summer. I don't get it. You needs it. Guys, you can't just keep hooking up and not at least try and figure out what you mean to each other. No, no, no (trying to hold Barney who tries to kiss Robin). You need to define the relationship. You ne to have the talk. I think what Barney's saying is that definitions are important. You're their teacher, not their friend. If people don't know their place, nobody's happy. You have to make things clear. Define the relationship. You're not happy. You just think you're happy because you feel happy. Of course not. You and Robin need to have the talk. I'll give you 20... I just thought of a reason. Okay, seriously. We're at the point of physical violence. Now, will you please have the talk?  Ted's not here, Robin. I'd be glad to. Just as soon as you and Barney have the talk. No. Sit down, define the relationship, write down that definition on a piece of paper, slip it under the door, and if I like what I read, you can go. Then you'll die in there. Well, guess what? I broughtMarshall with me, so maybe we'll do the same. Just hanging out? Not good enough. I'll tell you where things aren't doing... out of that bedroom. Not good enough. Not... good enough. 20 minutes late on your first day? That's rough. That's awesome, Ted. Really? No, Ted, they don't realize they weren't lying."
1166,5,1,marshall ," I know. I Know. So... has the boat sailed on s*x tonight or... It's just a little something that we got for you that used to belong to my favourite professor of all time. Finish our drinks, go out in the alley, and whip stuff. OK Ted, You got first whip! Make him whip the habit! I'so excited about this whip! I got whip fever! Just whip him, Ted! Don't even aim! Just whip him! It's just the whip's not a toy. There's such a thing as common sense, you know. I will, some other time. Mistake number 3, dude, where was the hat? Cause if you're not going to wear it, I'm taking it back. Would you just have the talk, okay? It's a five-minute conversation, and then you get to have s*x afterwards. It's great! Back me up, Ted. What?! Just once, I wish you guys would call me on Tuxedo Night. Hey, guys. : We're just hanging out.""  Not good enough!  ""We're seeing where things are going.""  Not good enough!  ""We're Barnman and Robin."" (he laughs) Come on, you got to admit, that's kind of fun, Lily.  Not good enough! Congratulations, buddy. I think I know how to speed things up Pancakes, fresh bacon. It is so yummy.  Good enough! Hello. Hello. Good evening. Hello. Don't get up. Didn't we meet on a yacht? Hello. What? Did I not tell you guys that it was Tuxedo Night? Doesn't feel very good, does it?"
1167,5,1,other professor," (coming into the classroom) Sorry I'm late, everyone. My name is Professor Calzonetti. This is Economics 305. You may return to your seats."
1168,5,1,professor ,"Young man, for the last 28 years, Economics 305 has been taught right here in building 14, room 7."
1169,5,1,robin ,"Lily! All we need is your indoor ""whoo."" Barney's awesome. We're just not feeling it right now. But we'll totally still be friends. Oh no, no, no. God, no. Lily, it's not you. It's us. OK, I should get going. I got a date. Even better, seeing him naked. Slow your roll there, Lilypad. Ok, It's like this. After we kissed, we sat down to have the talk. We should figure out what this is. Okay, now, we have to figure this out. We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk. Yeah, we knew you would say that. That's why we kept it a secret. Euh, oh, hum, heu... Come on, Brad, that's... Wow, There's really six of them. But, I can't. No. No, no boyfriend. You're probably wondering why I've been quiet all night. Damn it, Hordichuk! You miss another gimme like that, I'm gonna come down there and put a slapper right up your beerhole! Come on! The truth is, I feel kind of weird being out with you. What? No, Brad, no, it's... God, no... Brad, no... This is about me and Barney. Well, we don't know what we are. I mean, my heart says ""leap into it."" My brain says ""it's a bad idea."" Why not? Lay it on me. That's putting it a bit strongly. A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay? We've been over this. Unless I say ""flugelhorn"" you haven't gone too far. Right. Look, don't even worry about it. It's... God. The doorknob's broken off. We're locked in here. Did, did you do this? Flugelhorn. Did you do this?  Ted, are you out there? Lily, let us out of here. Lily! Come on. Let us out! You're gonna lock us in here? Well, guess what? Maybe we'll spend the whole day having s*x!  Nice job, Ted. Not cool!  Dude, I'm starving. Let's... Let's just have the stupid talk. Come on.  Where do you see this relationship going? My God, that sounds so cheesy. Totally. But hum... Where do you see this relationship going? Mad? I feel the same way. I suck at relationships. I mean, except with Ted. He really got it right. I know it's a cliché, but... he really ruined me for other men. Maybe. But hum... I don't want to stop having s*x. Friends isn't gonna work. I know something we're good at. No,not that. Lying. Think about it. We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends. Why not just keep lying? Really. We sat down. We had the talk. Barney's my boyfriend now. We're both afraid of commitment but... the fact is, we also can't live without each other. And he's awesome. He looks nice in a suit.  He's my boyfriend.  She bought it. Totally. So, you want to get some breakfast? Well, lead the way, sweetie pie.  Yeah, that felt wrong."
1170,5,1,robin and barney, (striking their fist) What!
1171,5,1,student ,"I don't want to be an architect. T-Dawg, you're in the wrong room, bro."
1172,5,1,ted ,"Wow! What's this? A fedora! (he puts it on his head and pulls out a whip) I'm Indiana Jones! I'm Indiana Jones!! You know what we should do? We should... God... you just get me. All right. (imitating Clint Eastwood) Hey, dummy (to a mannequin). What did tell you about smoking in here? I'm so sorry. You can whip me if you want. I know what you're all thinking. Who's this cool peer of mine up in front the class?"" I know the board says ""Professor Mosby,"" but to you I'm Ted. Question. Awesome. Hit it. They're at home. I... Oh, God. Barney, it was awful. I was teaching... I am freaking out. I don't think I can do this. I don't think the talk is necessary. Because Robin is already his girlfriend. MacLaren's Bar, four years ago... ""Gremlins""? What about brunch? Is brunch cool? OK, new topic. How do I pick a tie?  Wait. Does professor have one ""F"" or two? Oh, my God... Oh, my God! Professor. Pro-fess-or. They're all staring at me. I don't know. Just do something! Two ""F's"". That looks right. I think that's right. Good morning. 'Sup, dudes? Silence! This is Architecture 101. I am Professor Mosby. But you can call me Ted. Professor Mosby. T-Dawg. Do not call me T-Dawg. Please save all your questions until the end of the lecture. Thank you! Now... Here's your think-about-it for the day. Every single person in this room... is already an architect. Can anyone here tell me what this class is really all about? Don't laugh. He's not... He's not entirely wrong. An architect must be economical in his use of space, so... well done. Looks like someone's building towards an A.  You... Why do you want to be an architect? Yes, exactly. It's not something you want to be. It's something you need to be. You don't have a choice, right? None of you has a choice. No questions! So if any of you have even the slightest inclination to do anything with your life other than become an architect, you're wasting my time and yours. There's the door... You can go. I'm serious. Get out, now. Wait... Don't... all leave! Architecture's fun! Look! I brought a hacky sack! Sorry, sir. This is... Architecture 101. Who invited their dad, right? Euh, yeah, but, I'm sure 200 architecture students and their professor all got the room wrong. Kids, out of my way! Sorry. Coming through. Excuse me. Coming through. Yeah, but here's the funny thing. By that point, I didn't have time to think about what kind of teacher I was going to be. I just got up there and talked about architecture. And it was kind of great. Thanks.  Yeah, I got you, buddy. (to Marshall and Lily) They still haven't had the talk? You do realize they were lying, right?"
1173,5,1,voice ,"Ladies and gentlemen, time to pucker up for the New York Rangers Kiss Cam!"
1174,5,1,,"2009: IN. TED'S CLASSROOM Ted (2030): Kids, on my first day as a college professor, there were two things I didn't know that I wish did. The first thing was that your mother was in that classroom. Ted (2030): The second thing? Well, to explain that we have to go back to the beginning of the summer. Ted (2030): When, after a year of wrestling with their feelings for each other, Barney and Robin finally, well... Ted (2030): After that, the summer went by way too fast. Until all of a sudden, it was the Friday before my first day as a college professor. And after having s*x:  Ted (2030): The next night, Robin and Brad went to a hockey game. Ted (2030 ): Finally, my first class had arrived. For real this time. I knew I had to make Ted (2030): I still hadn't decided what kind of professor I wanted to be...authoritative or cool guy. I thought I would decide in the moment. And I did. About 20 times. Ted (2030): This was it, my crossroads moment. What kind of professor was I gonna be. I had to decide. Ted (2030): Professor Mosby had arrived. Of course, if I had taken Ted (2030): Yes, I was in the wrong classroom. And thus began the most humiliating seven minutes of my life. Ted (2030): Of course, I wasn't in the room for this conversation, but I have to imagine"
1175,5,2,all the other, Ted?
1176,5,2,barney ,"Guess who just got four tickets to the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" Star Wars exhibit? No, I said, ""Guess who?"" Peter Mayhew, in the fur. Who's with me? We're not going to the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" exhibit,Marshall. It's inHouston this year. Everyone knows that. I just wanted to get rid of the girls. My guy in the DA's office scored us front row seats to a lethal injection. But we're still stopping for chili dogs first. Marshall, now that Robin and I are together, I've learned a lot about relationships by watching you and Lily. You're a terrible couple. Lily has taken all the man out of you. I used to think that's just every relationship. But what I've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the same time. Are you kidding? She'd sprint down here with a purse full of singles and a poncho for the 10:30 Jell-O show. BT-Dub, I called ahead it's lime. What is wrong with you? You're just looking. It's like fantasizing about other women. It's harmless. Wait. Don't tell me you don't fantasize about other women. False! I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck's mudflaps. Took me less than a mile. That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Dude, Lily gets you in real life She has no business in your fantasies. I accept your invitation. Marshall Eriksen, from this day forward, I will be the wingman of your mind. Now, focus on the next dancer. Put Lily completely out of your mind. Ted, we found a stripper who looks exactly like Lily! I'm speechless, too. Everything's as perky as we've always imagined! Oh, I will. But first, I'm going to makeMarshall watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant between his wife's tatas. You will not believe who we saw tonight. We saw the third doppelganger! Hey, hey, hey, hey! (showing a girl who spits on the ground) Ladies, meet Stripper Lily. (showing a photo in his cellular) Yeah, I couldn't get her face in it. But she looks just like you. Busted. Marshall made me go. See,Marshall? We got to have a bros' night at a strip club and both of our ladies are totally cool with it. Because they understand that it's healthy for us to do that from time to time. Because it's harmless. And, Lil,Marshall shouldn't have to go to so much trouble just to have an innocent fantasy. Marshall, tell her. We're all friends here. Psst! Ted! (showing a girl with his head)  You know, I don't come here that much. Thank you, kindly stranger. You are the best. My girlfriend is at a strip club with me and she couldn't care less. Just the best. Just the best."

1178,5,2,doctor ," Bad news. Lily has a rare and fatal hiccup disorder that's apparently medical illegitimate. Beats me, but it says it right here on this doctor clipboard that doctors have."
1179,5,2,jen ,"Ted? It's nice to meet you. I'm between jobs banking crisis. I'm between jobs Internet bubble burst. Makes me realize I should go into something more stable... like banking. So what about you? So, any thoughts on food? I would love to share the oysters. Wow, that's bad. In this exact same restaurant. Me neither. I remember thinking that you were a little snobby. They're not weird. See, you're being snobby again. Whoa. We're going to die alone, aren't we? This is insane. Wait... Okay... yeah, we were sitting over there... (showing a table) I get it, Ted. Pointing out spelling errors in a menu makes you seem kind of snooty. Okay, well, what about me? Aside from the cats, how did I come across? Huh. I had no idea. We really are. Okay, I'm in. Where'd we go next? Okay. Hey, I didn't really talk about my cats that much, did I? And then, there's Tabby-gail Adams, the jester of the group. Tone down the kitty talk. Check. Well, I kept telling you I was cold, but you didn't offer me your jacket. It's a little brisk out tonight, huh? Really? I can't feel my fingers. After a day of fighting fires, Jim would love to come home and unwind working on his '68 Camaro. That or bare-knuck boxing, which he learned in the Marine Corps. Okay, so no talking about the ex. Not even about his shockingly small wiener? Oh, yeah! I do remember. We went in here for a drink with your friends. Who I loved... Or hated, depending on whether you're still friends with them. They're family, Ted. Actually you know what it was? I remember him coming across as kind of a player. Yeah. We were all sitting over there... (showing a table) And here's a picture of my cats dressed up like Batman villains. You got the Joker, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze... Yeah, that would've been good. Gosh, I thought you were such a jerk. I'm so sorry. ""Present you"" isn't so bad, either. Thank you very much. Yes. Oh, yeah! I remember this. Aww... That's kind of sweet. Oh, look. Snack break. Me, too. I remember now.  Wow. Yeah, I, I would. Will you call me? Promise? Good night, Ted. Hello? Ted, there are two kinds of guys. The guys that you want to call you, who don't; and the guys you don't want to call you, who always do. And somehow, right now, you're both. The only thing that we've learned is that, seven years ago, it was mistake for us to go out. And I guess it was a mistake for us to go out tonight. Wow. ... now what? Why? What? Now that you mention it... I'm never going to stop talking about my cats. They're funny and adorable and totally worth having to take six Benadryl a day. Oh, dear God, I hope that doesn't happen. You too, Ted. You'll find your shellfish lady."
1180,5,2,lily ,"Why?  I heard you. It's time, baby. No,Marshall, you must. And after an appropriate number of years, you should find someone else. Someone like that busty delivery girl from that one time. And plow her like a cornfield. Oh! So you went to a strip club? And there was a stripper who looked exactly like me? Awesome! I bet the guys were going crazy. Oh, I bet they wanted to touch her so bad. But all you can do is look, unless you go into the back room, but honey, you got to pay for that. Was there a shower on stage? Sometimes there's a shower on stage. I bet stripper me would get in there with another girl and just go bananas. Trouble? What trouble? You k*ll me off?! I mean, fantasize about other girls all you want, but could you maybe not m*rder me?! Oh, let's not forget the menu typo gold mine. Keep pannin' that river, buddy. What about Cat Woman? Baby... You should be able to fantasize about another woman without feeling guilty, or you know, k*ll*ing me off. All right, we got to fix this. Okay, when Stripper Lily gets out here, you have my permission to fantasize about her. And since she's basically me, maybe you won't feel guilty. Bring out Stripper Lily! I am hot! Oh, crawl for it, stripper me.I is awesome. Baby, can I get another hundred? Wow, she crawls fast.  What did you say, buddy? Who? Oh, yes... I am this Lily. We married long time. May I have monies for shopping?"
1181,5,2,marhsall ,"I wish that I could, but I've been doing this for so long, I'm all confused about death and s*x. It's gotten to the pot where every time I drive past a cemetery, I'm sportin' a partial."
1182,5,2,marsahll ,Barney? Is it just me or does that stripper look exactly like...?
1183,5,2,marshall ,"What? No, what are you talking about? It can be our first double date as couples! And plus, it sounds awesome! Is the original Chewbacca going to be there? Hey, do you think they'll have Wookiee to English dictionaries there? I mean, even just an everyday phrase book would be helpful. Where are you taking me, Barney? Where are you taking me? Barney, why are we here? Thanks, man. Okay, right. So, if Robin knew that you were here, she would be completely fine with it? Married! I do! It's just not that easy. Not everyone is you, okay, Barney? Even when I do start to have a dirty thought like that... it seems so much like cheating on Lily, that I feel guilty. So first, I need to have a different fantasy.  What?! How could this be?! I will never love again.  This one's for you Lily. (to the delivery girl, opening his shirt) Where do I sign? And then watch out, because it is on! It's all I know, okay? I can't, I can't help it. Stop looking at her.  I'll k*ll you! Dude, um... Okay, babe, look, before you get mad, let me... It's, no, it's nothing. Lily, Sometimes I think about other women. Okay, it happens. But even when I do, I feel so guilty that I have to imagine you... passing away first, because even in a fantasy world, I could never cheat on you. You're... you're just my life, baby. And I love you. m*rder?! No! I, baby-no. You develop a chronic illness! I spare no expense for your care! I even stand up a foundation in your name. We're, like, this close to a cure. Well, it is a lot cheaper than buying a condom. Oh! Thanks, baby. I'm-I'm so lucky I have you. And stripper you. That was a hundred? Wow. Hey. Girlfriend trouble? I wish I could help, but my unbelievably cool wife just bought us a private dance with her stripper body double. So if you need me, I'll be getting grinded like some pepper, in theChampagne room. Hey, Lil. Looks like, uh, Jasmine's having a hard time getting out of those boots. Lily?  Lily!"
1184,5,2,priest ,"And so,Marshall, to honour Lily, you must find that busty delivery girl from that one time and plow her like a cornfield."
1185,5,2,robin ,"Yeah, um, isn't it a little early in our relationship to do something that would end our relationship? So... Strip club. I'm not cool with it. It's disgusting. Did one of your whores tell you that? No, we're not. Did he juggle? Bad puns? Mmm. Expect a standing ovation for picking up a $19 check I do care, Barney. Look, we're dating now, okay? That changes things. We have to have a serious talk about this."
1186,5,2,ted ,"Jen? It's nice to meet you, too. Wait a second, the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" exhibit's inMontreal this year. Everyone knows that. Where are you taking me? Stop the cab. So, Jen, what do you do? I'm an architect. Hopefully, one day, I can use my own humble brush on the masterpiece that isManhattan's skyline. I teach architecture. Get 50% off so, that's pretty sweet.  Yeah, I can't talk right now. Uh, look, I got to go. Take a picture.  Sorry about that. Yeah, do you wanna share the oysters?  Good. 'Cause if you didn't......that would be mighty shellfish. That's why it's funny! We've been on this exact blind date before. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that blind date went too well. Wait, you... You dressur cats up in weird costumes. Oh, my God. Do you realize what this means? Since our first date, we've done a complete lap of all the single people inNew York only to end up back here, with each other. Well, you've got your cats. Wait, I got to ask. Why did you think I was snobby? Main Lobster. They spelled ""Maine"" without the ""e."" Good to know we're not getting the crappy understudy lobsters, right? Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half lobster will be played by... Huh. I had no idea. That's right-- the check. The check came and, of course, I was going to pay, but you didn't do the check dance. This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. 'Cause let's be honest, we are scaring people off, Jen. Great. I think we went to MacLaren's. All right, so what did I do wrong next? Let me have it. I'm here to learn. Not really. I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that. I couldn't admit I was cold. I didn't want to seem like a wimp compared to your action hero ex-boyfriend who you wouldn't stop talking about. I had an aunt in the Coast Guard. See? Why didn't you lead off with that? Remember? (showing the Mc Laren's bar) You loved them. Let's go in and see what they remember. And they are my best friends, so don't be surprised if they suddenly ""can't think"" of anything I do wrong. Me?  Nice. Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! I remember that. I was not checking out a girl. Nice. We were checking out Moustache Marshall. Yeah, well, it's nice to know ""past me"" wasn't a total jackass, huh? You got it. ...and there's theChryslerBuilding. And the Empire State Building. And at 12:00, a rotund couple going at it against the glass. Good for them. Letting a guy eat pizza off your back, that's love. So, um... I know this wasn't the best That was really great. Wh... What went wrong? Yeah. So would you maybe, um... want to go out again? Absolutely. Promise. I have been so busy. Jen, I sorry. Look, I know I'm seven years late with this call, but I was an idiot back then. You saw the goatee. The truth is, I had a great time tonight, and I'd love to see you again. Look, Jen, I wish I could go back and talk some sense into 2002 Ted, but that guy's a lost cause. He's 24. He thinks a little facial hair makes him look like John Depp. And he has no idea what a great girl he's missing out on. But I've learned a lot since then. I've learned a lot tonight. No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently... who knows what I just remembered why I didn't call you. I can't believe I'm gonna screw this up again, but, um... I like finding typos in menus. And I know my shellfish pun is stupid but the truth... I'm not suddenly gonna stop making stupid jokes. Shouldn't we hold out for the person who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks, but actually kind of likes them? Even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other, seven years from now? Well... good luck out there, Jen."
1187,5,2,ted and jen, We've been on this date before.
1188,5,2,ted imagines, She wants to pay the restaurant. He offers her his jacket. They takes pictures with Moustache Marshall. He calls her after their date. They marry.
1189,5,2,the other, Ah...
1190,5,2,voice ,"Gentlemen, say hello J-J-J-Jasmine. Ladies and gentlemen... Oh, hey, Barney. Didn't see you come in. I'll load up some AC/DC for you, buddy. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for J-J-Jasmine."
1191,5,2,waitress ,"Hey, Barney. He's the usual and I'll send over the other usual as soon as she's done stretching."
1192,5,2,,"TED (2030):  This is the story of two blind dates. One in 2009... And one seven years earlier. In all that time, my dating routine remained more or less the same... until the fall of 2009, when I finally had a date that was different. Because it was exactly the same. I was on a blind date with the same woman I went on a blind date with seven years earlier. Ted (2030): And she didn't remember it. But then again... Ted (2030): Neither did I. Ted (2030): This wasn't the first time your Uncle Barney had kidnapped one of us. Ted (2030): Meanwhile, Jen and I were at my favourite first date restaurant... for the second time. Ted (2030): I should explain. Over the years we had spotted two strangers who looked exactly like Ted (2030): Lesbian Robin. Ted (2030): And Moustache Marshall. By the following summer, we would find the remaining two doppelgangers. But I'll get to that. Ted (2030): And kids, when I told your mother that shellfish joke, she did laugh. And I swear, it was only, like, 30% pity."
1193,5,3,barney ,"Mm-hmm. And yes... we can. Hey. What's wrong? Shh, shh, shh. What you need to do is talk through this stuff. And then, once you're off the phone with Lily, I'll be down in the bar ready to have s*x. Mm-kay? She really said that? Yes, totally. Yeah. Only thing, and this is just me-- I like my testicles attached to my body, rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out! ...rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out! Stinson back in. Say, hypothetically, I did want to change who I am to become a better boyfriend to Robin, which I do not! What kind of changes are we talking about? Okay. I'm bored. Can we draw boobs on the chalkboard?  No, like, really big boobs. Can we have class outside? What? I'm tweeting about you. You should be flattered. How do you spell blah-blah-blah- ""H's"" or no? They said I had A-D... something. Can we have class outside? Do you think I should get Sports Illustrated for 70% off the cover price? Can we have class outside? I got to find a way to reach this kid. You guys just had s*x? Oh! Wasn't me. Okay. That's a building. Dude! Whoa... ""You're an idiot""? I can't believe I'm taking sexual advice from Ted Mosby. That's like taking fashion advice from... well, Ted Mosby. What do you mean? Yeah, it's boring as hell and I'm not learning anything. Uh-huh. Uh, can you hear this, Professor? (showing is thumb down) Or should I turn it up for you? (he turns it up). What... Trick question. Get her butterscotch. Butterscotch is to Canadian women what chocolate is to American women. To become the most successful female TV journalist of all time. No! Robin's deep-seated need for attention can traced back to her father's emotional distance, and no amount of success will ever make up for what she truly needs, which is six simple words from her Dad: ""Robin, I'm proud of you, eh?"" ""Oh, Captain! My Captain!"" I know, right? The end? Tears. I got this. So, emperor penguins-- crazy, huh? Marshall, did you sells out? On the bright side, he came in handy standing in for you during the role-playing exercises. Hey! He is an expert. He's a great teacher! That is a huge violation of my privacy! Go on. Hey. Before you say anything, I am done with this stupid Robin 101, okay? Here, I'll get rid of the notebook. (he throws it on the barrel) But there's... there's something that I did want to say to you. Robin, I have been with a lot of women, blondes, brunettes, redheads, big boobs, small Hmm? And your work address. Whoa."

1198,5,3,lily ,"But other than that, things are good? I guess, in a lot of ways, Barney doesn't stack up. I mean, you've had some pretty incredible boyfriends. What?! Oh, come on, Robin. Barney's not the type of guy who would... Go on. Well, that doesn't prove anything. And what do you plan on doing with it? No! Stop! Stop! Eye contact. Listen to me. Robin Scherbatsky is many things: friend, confidant, occasional guest star in some confusing dreams that remind me a woman's sexuality is a moving target. But she is no crazy, jealous stalker-bitch. (snatching the briefcase) Let go. Oh, that's great, honey. Marshall got it in college. He used it as a nightstand for years. Just go with it.  Be cool, baby. Damn! (toMarshall who is leaving with his barrel) See you, sweetie. Good luck. Now, can we please get out of here? A college notebook?! What do you know about this,Marshall?  ""Class number two.""  ""Three Topics To Distract Robin From Being Mad At You."" ""Immediately switch the conversation To one of the following, ""unless you want Robin to start throwing her shoes."" Neither can you, sweetie. I don't know. Check this out. This is actually kind of sweet. I think 's nice that Ted knows you that well. Oh, here's a good one. ""Top Five Things Never to Do Around Robin.""  Oh, sweetie. Can I get you some butterscotch? So? : Kiss ass."
1199,5,3,marsahll ,"(upstais, lookin gout the window) Hey, guys! If you don't want the barrel, can you sit somewhere else? You're scaring away potential takers."
1200,5,3,marshall ,"Hey, I've been down in the basement storage area going through all the stuff that Lily and I left behind when we moved out. I'm Robin. We should've cleared it out for you much sooner. Oh, you're not upset. Good. Baby, guess what I found. Until we found out that Lily was allergic to barrel resin No, I'm not... I'm not just going to throw her out, okay? Mabel's like family. I want to give her away, um, to a lucky new owner. Do you know anyone? Well, he's not going to have the chance, because I am putting old Mabel in the Bermuda Triangle. This is so exciting. Right now there's some out there who has no idea that tonight they're going home with just... just the best barrel. Bye, babe. I hope I'm not too late! I want to see the look of joy on the new owner's face! She's still there! Okay Mabel, let's find you a new home. Here comes a guy! And he... he just walked, walked right on by it. He's probably rushing home to get a handcart or something. Yeah! Hey, better hurry up, pal. What are you guys doing with Barney's secret Robin notebook? Let me rephrase that. Did you two ladies lose some weight? Well... They realized they couldn't talk about this stuff at the bar, and since you live with Ted, they had to find someplace safe. So... Ted's classroom. Uh-oh. Looks like we got a taker. Oh, come on, dude. You know you want to A guy like you, beard, no mustache. You're exactly the kind of guy who could use a sweet barrel. Do it. (a dog pees on the barrel) No. No. That's not a fire hydrant! What... Well, he doesn't know that, baby! God! So why are you crying now? I was vulnerable, I said good-bye to a very dear friend today."
1201,5,3,robin ,"Boyfriend. Barney Stinson is my boyfriend. I've said it, like, a hundred times it still sounds weird to say. I don't know. I think Barney's been single for too long. Like, the other night, I wake up at 4:00 a.m Barney, are you awake? Barney? Barney. This is not a one-night stand. We're dating. Come back to bed. That's happened three times. And it's not just that, it's other things.  It was just one thing after another at work today, and then... (sniffling) I found out my aunt's in the hospital. I'm just, I'm feeling so overwhelmed and it's just... Oh, thanks. Look, I'm not the touchy-feely-est person in the world, but... a little more effort would be nice. I understand. No, that's not it. I don't know. Maybe he just doesn't have it in him. Maybe is whole thing's a big mistake. He's cheating on me. Why else would he buy me flowers? He's gettin' some on the side. Plus, he keeps saying he's working late. But when I call his office, they say he left hours ago. Yes. Proof. Go word. I'm glad you brought that up. Barney's briefcase. He forgot it here this morning. (taking Barney's briefcase). We, we-- you and I-- are going to open it up and look for evidence. Ted probably has a sledgehammer around here somewhere. There's a basement storage area? What the hell is that?  Barrel resin? So you need a hand throwing it out? So, um, what are you gonna do with Mabel? Yeah, hmm, let me think. Do I know any rodeo clowns? Oh, that's weird, I do. But even Lenny wouldn't go near that mess. Well, let's just hope they're not allergic to barrel sin like Lily here. Yeah. I'll grab my coat. Oops. Oh, my God, he's cheating on me with some college girl. I knew there was a skank but I thought she'd at least be dumb.(reading the notebook) ""Birthday: July 23.Favorite hockey team: the Vancouver Canucks. Age: 29, but tells people that she's 26."" Oh, my God,these are notes about me. Or some 29-year-old version of me. Why would Barney have a notebook full of information about me? Why is Ted teaching a class about me? It all started a few weeks ago. Hey, guys. What you talking about? ""Top Ten Robin Scherbatsky Facial Expressions and Their Meaning."" ""Defusing the b*mb""? What does that even mean? ""Distract"" me? Oh, that is so condescending. These guys are really starting to piss me off! What?! That's not distracting. That's just talking about the story of a scrappy little underdog team that prevailed despite very shaky goal ending and, frankly, the declining skills of Trevor Linden. You have to clean your g*n. My uncle had a filthy old shotgun, blew both his thumbs off trying to shoot a beaver. You want to distract someone, make them watch my uncle try to eat corn on the cob. Did you know that before intercourse, the male and female emperor penguins bow to each other? Mr. Penguin (bowing). Mrs. Penguin (boxing). Oh, God, silly penguins, acting all fancy. ( she laugs) What were we talking about? Ted's only teaching Barney horrible things about me. Ah, well, too bad it's next to a page entitled...  Okay, can I just say that my deepest need in life not to have my father to say, ""I am proud of you, eh?"" I'm not crying. Oh, stop it. Wait a second. It says here that the class meets at 6:15 on Tuesday. That's right now. Yeah, I have one. What the hell do you two think you're doing? Dude, it's a barrel! I have so many questions. Why would you do this? What were you thinking? Who the hell is that guy? (showing a guy in the classroom). ""Auditing""? Wait. You did role-playing exercises where I was played by Shin-Ya? You know, I can't believe you, Ted. You actually think you're some kind of an expert on me? You know, half the stuff in this notebook is patently wrong. ""Robin Scherbatsky's Surprising Erogenous Zones""? Let me clear something up for you, Ted.  (embarassed) Oh. Yeah... Oh, uh, no. Um, the right one's ticklish, I guess. But the left one, yeah, I'm glad you're back there. Because that is just some sweet, sweet lovin'. We had just started dating. I was being nice.  And you. You know, I got it into my head this week that you were cheating on me. I even broke open your briefcase to look for evidence. You know, in a way, I was right. You cheated. You can't get some crib sheet on dating me. That's not how it works. If we didn't figure out how to be with each other in a real, honest way, I don't see the point of even trying. What do you want? I guess I'm impressed by how much you remembered. Well, since you know me pretty well... am I fooling myself with this whole Barney thing? You're an idiot. You know... That notebook, um, does contain a lot of personal info, and I think it has my home address."
1202,5,3,shin-ya," (speaking Chinese) They made me wear a wig, It was very demeaning."
1203,5,3,student ,"Uh, Professor Mosby? That's a woman drinking beer on the toilet."
1204,5,3,ted ,"Well, anything sounds weird if you say it a hundred times. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.  Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl Bowl. Bowl. Bowl? And she meant it. Trust me. I dated Robin for a year-- if you don't want to lose her, you gotta try a little harder. Be more attentive to where she is emotionally. You know, just be present. Mm-hmm. Welcome to Robin 101. Why, I mean, there's just so much you need to know about her. Okay, for starters, don't ever cry in front her. And whatever you do, don't cry in front of her four times.  ""How To Date Robin Scherbatsky."" Lesson one. Now, even though she puts up a tough exterior, what Robin really wants, deep down... You said you wanted my help. We did that ready. No. Look, I need this, too. I've only been a professor a few weeks. Being up here, it's, it's good practice for me. No! What Robin really wants deep down... Barney! Wow, you were just, like, the worst student in the world, weren't you? Barney, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up. I love you and I love Robin. And I want to make this work. So if you give me a few weeks of attention, I could give you a lifetime of happiness. Can you do that for me? Now, notice the vacant eyes, the pale, queasy expression, suggesting nausea. What do these mean? Dude! I worked really hard on these slides, okay? Can we just... This look is hunger. If you ever see Robin looking like this, get some food in her quick,or one of two things will happen. One: weird, out-of-context laughter. (changing the photo) Or two: spontaneously falling to sleep in strange places. But the most important facial expression of all? Oh... (chuckling) That's for my class. TheFlatironBuilding. Fun story about it. It was designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style; this architectural gem... Right. The most important facial expression of all. Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. If you ever, ever see this face, Barney, run. And don't take a picture of it. She will punch you. And you will cry... for the third time... that night. Which brings us to an important point: defusing the b*mb. One. ""Vancouver Canucks 2004 Division Title."" Two: ""Proper g*n Cleaning and Maintenance."" Three: ""Emperor Penguins."" Now, we all know Robin's not what you'd call ""touchy-feely."" She doesn't say, ""I love you,"" like a normal person. Instead, she'll laugh, shake her head, give you a little smile and say, ""You're an idiot."" Yup. If she tells you you're an idiot, you're a lucky man. And if she does say ""I love you,"" she's already broken up with you in her mind. ""Robin Scherbatsky's Surprising Erogenous Zones."" Right knee-- ticklish. Left knee... Does lefty like that? Oh, yeah...lefty like that. Three: ""Never, ever play the 'Guess Who' game with her.""  Guess who?  It's me! It's me! It's me! Number four: ""Unless you want to see it 80 times a day, for the next month, never show Robin a YouTube clip of an animal playing a musical instrument."" Barney! Do you have a problem with this class? Uh, well, maybe the problem is your attitude. You're not listening to a word I say. Oh, you think you're not learning anything, huh? Okay. Pop quiz. When Robin's PMS-ing, what kind of chocolate should you get her? Correct! Why? Correct! What is Robin's dream job? Correct! And if she achieves that, will she truly be happy? Yes! But I guess you're right. You haven't learned anything. Sorry to have wasted your time. How good was Dead Poet's Society? Now, as you can see, well over 50% of the blankets have been dragged onto her side. Make no mistake. Robin Scherbatsky is a classic, textbook... cover hog. Any questions? Yes, Robin?  Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. Uh-oh. Aw! You're giving Mabel away? Oh, that's Shin-Ya. He's sort of been auditing the class. Well, tried to explain to him it wasn't a real class, but I don't think he speaks much English. Uh, really? Name one wrong thing. Does lefty like that? Don't wanna leave out the righty. Noted. That was a lie? Look. All that stuff I told Barney... It was personal between you and me. I'm really sorry. It's funny. When you date someone, it's like you're taking one long course in who that person is and then, when you break up, all that stuff becomes useless. It's the emotional equivalent of an English degree. I guess I just liked the idea of putting all my Robin Scherbatsky knowledge to good use, you know? I don't know. I will say this, though. I've seen Barney work very hard to get women. I've seen him work very hard to get rid of women. I've never seen him work this hard to keep one around. I was going to give him an A. Well, B+ -- Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve. Designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style, this architectural gem was the first of its kind... Yes, Susan? Right. That-That... was Daniel Burnham's wife. She was a troubled, troubled woman. We are moving on."
1205,5,3,,"Ted (2030): Kids, your uncle Barney had been called a lot of names over the years. Ted (2030): But there's one name none of us ever expected to hear him called. Ted (2030): But then a funny thing happened. Over the next couple weeks, Barney was thoughtful, considerate, sweet. In short, the perfect boyfriend. Which, to Robin, meant only one thing. Ted ( 2030): The Bermuda Triangle was the name we'd given years earlier to the curb right in front of our building. Whenever we wanted to give something away, we'd put it right there. It was uncanny. Ted (2030): The truth was...Barney was taking a night school class taught... by me. Ted (2030): It may not have been a thumbs-up, kids."
1206,5,4,barney ,"Ah, tweed. Textile of the eunuch. Because the people who wear them are constantly going, ""Aw, geez, why can't I get laid?""  Worst night ever. It was like we were on a date with a sad, chubby girl our mom made us call. And they kept shoving platters of food in our faces. Um, we-we-we didn't realize there was gonna be dinner. We sucked down a couple tacos outside the subway. And if anything didn't go according to plan, they would freak out. This is a web siteMarshall already made about last night. (he takes a computer) It's called itwasthebestnightever.com. Needless to say, we've both changed our e-mail addresses. I mean, we knew we were gonna have fun tonight, but we had no idea how much. Let's do it again, soon. Uh, no, it doesn't. Ted, let me ask you a question. Where does this girl live, exactly?  You're the sexless innkeeper. Ted, many a man--nay, many a soul--has their own tale of the sexless innkeeper. Why, I had run-in with one just last year. I even composed a poem about it. Would you care to hear it? T'was the night before new year's, and the weather grew mean. It was 3:00 in the morning, And I was stranded in queens. (2008, the whole story of Barney is illustrated with images) The tavern grew empty, the gas lights grew dim. The horse-drawn carriages were all but snowed in... Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, ""where do you live?""And she said, ""one block south."". I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you. Look! I'm sorry that we have been dodging your calls, but we respect you guys too much as friends to give you some song and dance. You deserve the truth. (he sighs) The US Navy has found intelligent alien life at the bottom of the ocean. For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I have been tapped to lead the expedition. Plus, the alien thing. I think they bought it. Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day, But don't you have to get back up to the inn? I mean, who's working the front desk? To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving? Mint on the pillow, Ted! And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy! It does. Hey. Long time no see. Have a seat. Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out. Who the hell are these people? Pfft. Not us. Hey, why don't we call that weird couple down the hall from you? You know, with the ferrets? Maybe they want to come over and play taboo. Maybe. But they're Armani. Then what are you doing, standing out in the rain with us? We'll never sleep on thegouda again. No, not really. With quill? No way. You made that up. Whew!"
1207,5,4,girl ,"So is it hard to grade papers? So, you said you live right upstairs... Hey, Ted. Great time last night. Well, let's do it again, soon. I'll...uh, call you. That was amazing, Lily! Are you coming back bed, professor?"
1208,5,4,guy ,"Um, it's April. Well, we should probably be going. Well, he can't have enjoyed it as much as I'm enjoying thisgouda! You guys are the best."
1209,5,4,lily ,"So guys, Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place for a little couples' night. Welcome. This is great. We're having fun. You're having fun, right? Our parents really want to meet you!  There's still pie.  Wohoo! Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place for a little couples' night. Okay. Game time. Let's review the flow of the room. (moving in the room) Barney and Robin enter here. Stop here for margaritas. That's a great conversation starter. We can tell them about nour trip to Cabo. Then we'll move on to the hot apps station. And, depending on how things are going, Some lively pre-dinner charades. Sounds like? Oh... Baby, we can do this. Welcome. Take care. Bye. Nailed it! Hey. Come on in. Would you like a margarita? That's prosciutto-wrapped melon. That's seared scallops with a mango chutney. And that's Lobster ravioli in a black truffle oil. What do you mean, the egg timer is broken? What are we going to use for charades, sweetie? Now, Robin... You work in television. We're experiencing some technical difficulties. ( she laughs): You get that? We're still laughing. Right? Laugh,Marshall. Hey, guys. Good news. First of all, you can ignore all the e-mails and texts we've sent you. Because we went ahead and booked that couples' weekend for all of us inVermont! Check it out. Saturday we've got apple-picking, antiquing, then a hated hay ride. Wow, Barney. That kind of sounds like the stuff you say to girls when you're too much of a coward to dump them. What's going on? Come on,Marshall. We're so lovable. I thought we did everything right. Oh, dear god.Marshall, we've been over and over this. You have to stop sending those to people. I can't believe you sent them one of those. They think we're insane now. Oh, what about you forgetting to check the egg timer for charades? I gave you one thing to do,Marshall. One thing. You're a sturdy, cheese-bearing cracker! Oh. I wish you had called. Um, listen, now's not a good time. We'll call you. Oh, we can't. We're here with Py and Shea. Oh, it might be weird. We're kind of on a double date. Wouldn't want you to feel like a fifth and sixth wheel. They just moved here fromHawaii. Py is a total foodie And Shea, well... She's... Anyhoo, we can't stay long. We're just gonna grab a quick beer and then take these kooks for a boat ride around the city. I know! When I got that left-hand- yellow, I was like, ""what?!"" How do we know you two won't hurt us again? Damn it. Why is there something so attractive about a bad boy... And girl? Come here, you two."
1210,5,4,man ,"I'm sorry, Marshall, but Falguni and I are just not that into you. And you."
1211,5,4,marshall ,"You know, I've always wondered why those tweed jackets have elbow patches. Gouda? So, should we just go ahead and lock the four of us in for new year's? Right. Sorry. We're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's talk Thanksgiving. Wait. But, wait, if you leave now, Colonel mustard just gets away with it. Tonight was fantastic. We should do it again. Great, 'cause I got that story about Sammy Hagar Anthe Belgian waffle locked and loaded. Right, but, uh, we'll play that one by... (showing his ears) Okay, you can be Robin's partner. Gouda? Best night ever! In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating a Belgian waffle! You guys are going to want to get in on thisgouda. Seriously, don't sleep on thegouda. Ooh...Tick-tock goes thegouda clock. I'm working on it, darling. Okay? Just stall them. It was the best night ever laughter raining down like April showers oh, we talked for hours... best night ever... Then we played charades. Lily made some creme brulee, lay-lay-lay-lay and now that we're best couple friends there's only one thing left to say... are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free next Saturday? That's the 17th.are you free? Friday or Sunday would also work. Or basically any other day. Oh. Oh, we never joke about b&b's, especially at the height of syrup season. And then on Sunday, we're up at 6:00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike. Now, you better pack your long johns, 'cause it is cold up there. Yeah. You know, that's exactly what it sounds like. But if that's true, that's awesome. Let's go. You know what? I hope those underwater aliens are cold-blooded. 'cause then you guys will get along just fine. I can't believe they broke up with us. No, we're not. We're ugly and gross. I know! I know. We had thegouda. We had my waffle story. I even sent them a awesome photo montage. Nothing. ordered Chinese food today some moo shu pork sauce got away flipped the cushion, now everything's okay. Cat-sitting for Lily's mom, cat-sitting for Lily's mom, it's gonna be fun, it's gonna bring us all closer together. (in the video,Marshall let the cats going out by the window) Cat funeral, cat funeral, it was an accident and not entirely my fault, cat funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow, ca funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow. We'll miss you, whiskers, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow... If I recall, they didn't dump us until you brought up thatVermont trip. It was way too early. First, a boat ride around the city, then a trip toVermont. It's a rookie mistake, and you're better than that. One thing? (Lily nods) One thing? Wow. Really? So, I guess that gouda Just walked itself right through the door...Sliced itself up, and arranged itself in a perfect semi-circle around not three, not four... But five different kinds of sturdy, cheese-bearing crackers? (to a couple, inside the apartment) I swear, he was right there just eating a Belgian waffle! Oh! Hey! Hey, guys. Yeah, sorry. Mmm! Shea...Shea is just... Well, we don't want to jinx it, but, uh... We kind of think they might be the two. (he touches the table) Ooh. Oh, yeah! Oh, right back at you! You know what? We have two very nice people up in that apartment Who are perfect for us. I think we can change them.  What have I done?"
1212,5,4,robin ,"You know, there is something to that. I remember thinking my tenth grade math teacher was very sexy. I wonder if Harold's still in jail. What? Tax evasion. Among other things. Uh, sure. Why not? Um, sure, why not? Brutal. And they were so nervous, that they weren't even making sense half of the time. Yeah, how'd you know? P.S., not sitting great. Show him. Yeah, tough luck, every Saturday night I've ever had, 'cause this one just blew you out of the water. Yeah, we'll call you. Well, that's what you say at the end of a crappy date. Who was that? Oh, my god! You're right! He's totally the sexless innkeeper! Which is funny, because usually it's the innkeeper who offers turndown service. Oh! We have. Go on. Wait, you guys were serious about that? Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys. No...Lily... You're right. All that sexlessness has made you wise. Hey. We wanted to say we're sorry. Wait. We just want... Oh, it's just... We haven't seen you guys all week. Yeah. Wow, it sounds like this is getting pretty serious. Pfft, who needs 'em? Hi. Two for dinner. After midnight? No way. We can't tabooty-call them, it's pathetic. For charades. You don't. Barney, you ready for brunch with Lily and Marshall?"

1214,5,4,ted ,"You are wrong. The ladies dig the professor look. No, you've just got to make it fun. For example, uh, every time I spot a grammatical error, I do a shot. I'm trashed right now, and I blame our public school system. Hey, how was the big couples' night with Marshall and Lily? Really? How? Let me guess: Did Marshall get, like, super intense about the cheese? Poor Marshall., Lily's this gourmet cook, and all she letsMarshall do ss pick out one sad block of cheese. Come on, they just got excited. They've been looking for couple best friends forever. Plus, I'm sure they weren't that bad. oh, that's not good. I don't understand. If last night went so horribly, why do Lily and Marshall think it was such a hit? They're your friends! Why would you just blatantly lie to them like that? Right? Oh, I don't want to brag, But it seems chicks are really digging the whole professor thing. Last night, she picked me up at the bar. And then... Well, she actually wound up falling asleep on the couch. But, hey, that happens. Sure, it does. You know, she was, she was just exhausted from being turned on. But you heard her. She wants to do it again, soon. Westchester. Why? What the hell is ""the sexless innkeeper""? Not really. Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist? Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash? No way. Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard. Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize. Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger. Thank you. For god's sake! Hey, guys. Barney, are you wearing sweat pants? Okay, guys, I've got some bad news for you. So I'm just going to come out and say it. You're a couple. And no matter how hard you try to fight it, couples need other couples. That's why you miss Marshall and Lily. And can't you just admit that? Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you. You want to hear it? 'twas the night before, I had hours to k*ll. (the whole story is illustrated with images) I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill. Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said ""classy,"" but her eyes whispered ""sin."" She said, ""you're a teacher?"" I said, ""yes, indeed."" ""I must have you,"" she moaned.""I'm turned on by tweed."" With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper. God, I love being single."

1216,5,4,,"Ted (2030): It was the Fall of 2009 and I was a professor now. So I decided to change my look a little bit. And people were noticing. Ted (2030): For years, Marshall and Lily had been the only married couple in a group full Ted (2030): They sucked at it. Ted (2030): But just when Lily and Marshall were about to give up, two of their best friends in the world got together. And hope returned to their hearts. Ted (2030): So when Lily said... Ted (2030): Barney and Robin had no idea what they were about to walk into. Ted (2030): Meanwhile, my half-baked theory that ladies dig the professor look was actually proving to be true. Ted (2030): Sometimes things just seem to magically fall into place. Ted (2030): Whether it's in the dating world... Ted (2030): Or the double-dating world. Ted (2030): It was true.Marshall had become addicted to creating songs and photo montages documenting various mundane events. So for months, all of Marshall's friends and professional colleagues were getting e-mails like this... Ted (2030): But eventually, even Barney and Robin had to admit they owed Lily and Marshall an apology. Barney and Robin are walking sadly in the street. We can hear a song: "

I know, and it's provided us with a lot of laughs. But, Robin, if you want to live here, work here and throw chairs at people here, you have to do this. A cit... No, no, you have to do it. I'll help you study. We're gonna stay up all night long. I'm gonna drill you, and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna do some cramming and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna bone up on... Sorry. It's a rich area. But you know, it's not going to be easy, this test. It's not like the Canadian citizenship test. It's Canada. Question one: Do you want to be Canadian? Question two: really? I don't know if you caught that, but he did the ""we"" thing. Okay. ""How many stars are on the flag?"" ""What are the first ten amendments to the Constitution called?"" Ready for the test maybe, but ready to be an American? Not on your sweet life. For you to be an American, we got to get the Canadian out of you. That's why I've created these questions. Question one: ""Who is this?"" No, the answer is Elton John. Question two: ""What the hell is this?"" Wrong. The answer we were looking for was ""I don't care, it's dumb"". Let's go buy something that's bad for us and then sue the people who made it. That's America, Robin. Correct. Archie Bunker's neighbor was George Jefferson. All right, hold your horses. Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie and the childhood obesity it leads to- who is this? Jeff Foxworthy? No, it's Jim Varney. You're kidding me. You don't know that? Not only are you wrong, but you are belligerently sticking to your g*ns and insulting me in the process. Robin Scherbatsky- you are an American. Good morning. You went Canadian. This Canadian. (He opens the curtains) Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky- you're in Toronto. You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic... You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours. God, you're still drunk. Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee, in you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test. But, before any of that, we're gonna do it on this bed 'cause... hotel room. Okay, let's get some coffee. It's like an entire country without a tailor. What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue. And there's kids playing hockey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you. Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back. Okay, that's it. (He climbs on a chair) Attention, Canada! I am Barney from America. And I'm here to fix your backward-ass country. Number one: get real money. Don't know what board game this came from, but it's a ""jhoke"". Number two- and this is the biggie- Quit letting awesome chicks like Robin Scherbatsky get away because, guess what? You don't want her? I'm planting my flag in her- if you know what I mean, which you probably don't- and getting her the hell out of here. You may now return to being pointless. (He sits down and three men arrive behind him) Ah, this coffee is excellent. Oh. Hey, fellas. It's called a ""tie"". Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday. Hmm. Wait, you can do that? I see. No, I can see out of my left eye again."

Mother was fit to be tied every time he used her prized rhododendron to do his business. Lacrosse ball, volleyball... Sparky was my best friend, but after I married Helen, old Spark started to feel a little left out. For so long, it had been just me and him, but now he suddenly felt like Helen had taken his place. What Sparky didn't realize was, even though I loved Helen, I still loved him, too. I had room in my heart for both of them. But maybe I should have put aside some special ball-tossing time just for the two of us t o make sure Sparky knew that he was a good boy. I wish now I had, 'cause old Sparky ran out in front of a Cadillac and got splattered like a watermelon in one of them Gallagher shows."

Sugar snap pea? Pea... That reminds me, I have to pee. Yellow, that reminds me, I have to pee. Great. Oh, hey, Ted... No, I was just going to say maybe we should listen to something. It's an audio book about a boy and his dog. It made Elisabeth Hasselbeck cry. That reminds me, I have to pee. Ah, I do. Besides, they have a spa. What kind of treatments do you offer?

Man, those Gazzola trips, that's... that's when we really became bros. Drank nothing but Tantrum. Oh, man, we went through a whole case of Tantrum one trip. I think that's the reason that I pass out when I hear church bells. So what time are we leaving for Gazzola's tomorrow? We most certainly did. We no longer have a hemorrhoid problem. Tantrum! We most certainly did! Don't worry, we'll get out on the road, it'll be just like old times. Goodbye, Sparky. Oh! Well, don't worry, the next exit's the hotel. We can go there. Well, I mean, single people can have fun here, too, right? Ok, Ted, we're not in college anymore, okay? We don't have to drive all night. Shh. Lily is asleep. I suppose I could reschedule my pedicure. What the hell? But only light beer because we have a couple hike in the morning. Dude, why are we pulling to the highway? Ted, where exactly are we going to get this beer? What are you doing? We can't just leave Lily. When she wakes up, she's going to freak! I just abandoned my wife. How am I supposed to have fun? If she's pissed, she's pissed. You're making me wonder if this pizza is worth the 22 hour drive. I feel so young again except for the chest pains. Cornmeal... I don't want this anymore. We shouldn't have left Lily. I have. I left her, like, 20 messages. I said, ""I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's all Ted's fault!"" This! This whole thing! We were having a perfectly nice trip, and then you kidnapped me. You didn't even let me, put on underwear! That is not true. Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's living. Car keys, please. I'm sorry, ted! No, I never should have brought lily. She pees all the time, even at the apartment. Still bros? Hells, yeah! Listen to the Sparky book again. Hey, baby? Baby? I'm so sorry that we left you. That's good. And I'm so sorry you didn't get any pizza. God, my stomach! Damn you, Gazzola's! Baby, cut it out of me. That was a wild trip, huh, Ted?

You guys will not believe this. I've been talking to my lawyer all morning. You know that guy I have a slight disagreement with at the Hoser Hut? He's filing assault charges. Come on! I broke his nose with a chair. And now, apparently, I may end up getting deported. Well, there's only one possible way to avoid getting deported. My lawyer said I could become an American citizen. Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am. Well, there's a citizenship test tomorrow. I'll think about it. Okay, Barney. It is. How do you know the Canadian test is easy? 50, one for each state. The Bill of Rights. Look, Barney, I know all this. I'm ready. Queen Elizabeth II. Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played... I want to say- Jefferson? Oh! Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now! That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the ""Hey, Vern"" guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy. Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all. (She throws one bottle on the floor) Maybe I'll rob a liquor store. Maybe I won't. My choice. Learn English!

Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut... And I met this women's curling team. We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams/Rich title double bill in Toronto. How did you find me, anyway? Canada isn't across the Atlantic. Barney, I'm not taking the test. Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be. Yeah, give me two coffees. What game? Oh, I guess I missed it. I'm not American. Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either. When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country. Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, ""Yeah, America's cool."" And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, ""Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too."" I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian. Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two. You understand?"

It's probably a good thing they're closing Gazzola's. Those trips were brutal, right? The long hours in the car, the motion sickness, the smell. I was thinking 9:00, 9:30. I am ready to hit the road.

How you doing? Do you watch the Jets game? How'd things go at the doctor? Oh, my God, that sucks! Yeah. I'm gonna go do push-ups in the kitchen. Tantrum! Yes, I do! I don't why they make phone books anymore. Everything's online, right? Tantrum! You invited Lily? Yeah, I heard him. All right, next stop: Chicago. Couldn't you have gone before we left? Okay, straight, straight, straight. Now, wait, a little to the left. We'll pass a state trooper. Ow! Thank you! You can't have to go again. It's not humanly possible. Oh, that's a great idea. I think I have some Jerky Boys. Oh, my God, Lily, please tell me you have to go pee! Hotel? It didn't work, I'm still here. Marshall, what are we doing? We should be on the road. Whoa. I got to dial back on the Tantrum. Hey, man. Sorry about what I said before. You want to go to the store and get some beer? Chicago. She'll have a back rub and a crumpet. She'll be fine. Relax. Have some fun. Hey, you really think Lily's pissed? Pfft. Kind of cross. Just like old times! But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust? I can't believe you guys are closing. Dude, don't look at it. That's a rookie mistake. Well, if you're so worried, why don't you give her a call? What exactly is ""Ted's fault""? We never used to put on underwear! That was the fun of a bro's trip to Gazzola's! We left everything, and everyone behind. It was just you and me! But now it's like you've disappeared into Lily. It is true. You're not upset because you're worried she's mad. You're upset because you'd rather be with her, eating muffins than here with me, eating this delicious... I think one of my mushrooms just crawled away. I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. I never should have been mad at you! Best bros. Hey, you want to crank some Van Halen just like old times?

Anyway, speaking of food, Marshall, I've got so bad news. Just read online, Gazzola's is closing. Ted (2030): Ah, Tantrum.

And I would walk 500 more...* Ted (2030): When Barney finally tracked down your Aunt Robin, it wasn't a pretty sight. Ted (2030): Yes, kids, it turns out Crumpet Manor had pampered Lily into a nearly comatose state of relaxation. She didn't even notice we were gone.

1231,5,6,barney ,"I hate to be the one to tell you. Marshall and Lily get divorced. Look what I saw yesterday. I gotta go. She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum. They have a big problem. If, when you're great like me. Listen to this. Robin taking into account the number of beds in which we did. One is 83 and a half. An Ottoman 19th in an antique shop. Big Tiger. You holding up? Want a hug? You mean yesterday? You're safe here. I'll tell you what's the problem. You know how I was always the best single? Now I'm the best in relationship. Even better than you and Lily. Let me ask you a question. Do you mind you, if the sink is full of dirty dishes? So what is the problem of Lily, not yours. You argue. Robin, we do not fight. No. And here's the secret, every time we say we're going to argue... It works in 100% of cases. No fighting if you're not there.This is what Gandhi said. Do not worry. It also has a good way to avoid arguments. There's so much to do with the mouth. Why spoil it by talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say on the dishes if I was married to Lily. Okay. Thank you, doll. I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, ""Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel"" is what you will paint the? Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing. It's because you're a woman. Of course not. Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy artillery. Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes. Now, turn around. The piercing was cool. You're welcome. I told you. Super. Here are your tasks for the weekend. Ted, you're gonna go see the neighbors. Marshall, you go see Lily. Robin and I need you for a crouched position on an animal skin in our chalet. Ready? Break! Okay. It's not great to finally see blossomed emotionally, spiritually and sexually? short, and your weekend? What happened to the ""I'm tired after my exhausting day and I want to use what little energy I have left to cover you with love""? You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean. Why, it would relieve any anxiety to any meal. Not having to tie your T-shirt to form a bowl of salted fortune for your pleasures. This world belongs to you, Marshall.Beach house, take it, put yourself in holiday clothes, benefits. What do you eat? Hey, Ro-Ro. As Gandhi said, ""A smile costs nothing, baby."" How will Marshall and Lily? You and your big, huge heart. What do you mean by that? Who the hell is Phil? All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend. I found at Marshall's arguments Lily were zero then it will never have to wash another dish. Slap me in two. You're on the side of Lily? You... (The chairlift stops) No. We will argue and I can not spin. Or so I tried the jump? This trick of dodging is over? You have the? This is the smallest! And it does not stop there. We argue non-stop since. The tie m*rder*d by Robin. As a quarterback to stay on top. Monday morning, he sits on an ice pack and are studying the tape of the match. Look, we were fed up everyone to tell us how we are no relations. We need advice. More important than winning. What about now? Or, there is a bench in the elevator. Grave. It's not a competition."

You're right. I'll do the dishes. Just after doing this. Baby, you can do the dishes? Baby, you can do the dishes? Excuse me? So you're saying you should not do the dishes because you work harder than me. I teach kindergarten. I shape the leaders of tomorrow. If you need to go there at night, or you turn on the light or toilet you sit. Danny is not here, Mrs. Torrance. Super. So I do not care if you have an orgasm. If you do not give a damn, do it yourself. You will perhaps have to do it again. Marshall, dinner is ready. No, but what is your favorite. I do not care when you take out. But if it is made of cheese as a good ziti, do soak. I love you. And keep in mind that the love you have for that other person is more important than winning. The honeymoon phase may be over, but now you can get down to business. And honestly, it's the best part. We won! You're dirty. It is you who should be in the sink."

I am a good boyfriend when I sleep. I can do a killer foot massage, hand and prepare a great chamomile on the other, which would make you cry. Damn, I know more about how to make popcorn and watch movies with Sandra Bullock in that you'll ever know, but thank you to worry, blue. Go ahead. Not really. But if I said that, we will play, so... I can not believe Robin supports it. You're leaving. Robin begins to coat. I never heard anything so stupid. Call me crazy. But when you have a problem with Lily, it is discussed. Go to the basics! Wait, Ted. Listen to the man. He's right. It was cool, huh? No, not at all. I hate doing the dishes right away. I hate it! I hate it from the depths of my soul! I hate it! I hate it I hate it! Barney... With his madness, his theory goes well thought might work. Will it work. Barney argued logically. Lily is a reasonable woman. I think if I explain, understand and can go in my opinion. It is a slap bet? Lily, I am delighted that you mention. I can stay here tonight? Terrible. And because of you! I listened to your advice stupid! Lily, I am delighted that you mention. No. And that's why... It's like, okay? You want me to get up and I wash my dishes. But maybe... I want you... combs the ceiling, right? I can say, ""Yes. I will do my dishes, if you get up and you painted the ceiling of naked babies. "" You see? It's just... I do not know what happened. I am a lawyer. I earn my living by arguing but when it is with Lily, I'm... confused. How not to be with her eyes and her breasts? I should have noted. I'm making more money than you. Dance for me. It's so much better when you said but with me, it turned into an argument. And when we started arguing, it starts to mutate and multiply. It started with the dishes but after... It's not what I say... but it's true. And suddenly, we argue as to who works the hardest. You eat cookies and you glue stuff. And other disputes are parties. Until there is so much we can no longer follow. My mother does not hate you. It is neutral about you.I'm not afraid of your imitation of Shining. I just did not need to hear it mostly at night. Do not do that, please. Dude, Lily is played badly. It is small... but as a vicious badger that your brother would have caught and starved for 5 days and placed in your sleeping bag. I should go and apologize. He's right. This dish is my manhood! And I want to leave my manhood deep in the dirty sink full of ketchup and pasta... Well shit, it's my right! I will wipe my manhood when I'm ready! I do not care if the dishes are not done. If you do not give a damn, do it. I spent 18 years without a woman does not affect me. I can do it again. I do not know what to do. We never had to fight so long. It's as if I no longer existed. Sunday morning, she made a pancake, Ted. A pancake and a slice of bacon. Well, maybe Barney was all inclusive. He and Ro-Ro are the best pair now. With Lily it was dethroned. Apparently, she loves them now. And... come on, someone had to stop T-Mose. The bagpipe seems different today. There was an echo. You've done for me? I'll do the dishes directly to my death. Sure, honey. I love you too. I do not know. Sometimes you just let his ego aside. Best couple of the world! Guess what? These glasses are plastic. So you can throw them. So no dirty dishes in the sink."
1235,5,6,robin ,"This is nonsense. They are still playing the bagpipes. It does not stop him from screaming to play louder, but it seems that there is rather strong. I have a glass of water in my room that vibrates like Jurassic Park. Why is there a bag of pants marked ""April 2008"" in your closet? The ties go to the machine? I think that's true. You know what? It's true. We tried to find out which of us was most great. But it said draw and we made love. Speaking of that, I am delighted that we go skiing this weekend. I need a break. The upstairs neighbors make me crazy. Thank you. The ski babes are back! We spent the weekend hugging the fireside. No black diamonds, nothing but red hearts. I'll unpack my bags. Where is he was not riding? Hey, Barnstormer. Nothing. We're just happy. So you talked to the neighbors? Some old? So you did what? I do not like nicknames. Seriously, stop. I do not like with you either. Those two worry me, really. Who, him? How would you know that? It's your board that is zero. I can not undress. It's freezing here. I'll be hypothermic. Or just the pants? I think. They fight because of you!? All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties. The hidden camera in the headboard. Barney for the millionth time... It was nice to be the ideal couple for one minute. Stop it. You see? At the moment, how did you do to fix everything? Calm. Calm down. Seriously, what's the secret? Good night. I think we should talk about advantage and get down to business. That's better. It is not the best couple in the world, so what?"
1236,5,6,ted ,"I know. It's been 6 hours. That must be the fact that Stan Tantric bagpipes. Are there neighbors! Stop the bagpipes! Not at all. There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand. I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... ""little known"" because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Robin, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever. And a half? According to Barney, Lily asking you to do your own dishes right away is a sign that your marriage falls apart. Of course I do. So when you think you will play and you get up you go? This is not true. Well, the thing naked is not bad. It was weird. Mad. Are you kidding me. You beat him or I do it? No. Marshall, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Barney Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003. Stay with me! Barney is wrong. You just said the opposite! Okay. There you are. You're gonna tell me the truth. Barney said that you did ever played. Impossible. I love you both but you're the two biggest emotional disabilities in the history of relations. You had to play at least once. Yeah, it's ugly. I'll go talk to them. Have fun. I will repeat once. This is a bad idea. A second time. This is a bad idea. No. She will be angry and you will play. We bet a slap. I am preparing the couch, man. How was the trip? What has happened between you? When did you become disgusting? We all came out a year. Barney's stupid ideas you have put into this mess. There is no escaping it. Make this stupid dishwasher. You're cute nicknames? Seriously. What happens to you both? I'm not sure that you know who Gandhi is. Yeah, yeah, I did. I went up ready to put them back. Really old. I did not have the strength to tell them to stop, because, good for them. So I told them you want to welcome, ate a hard caramel, acquiesced to some racist comments and I left. It's your fault. You took advice in love with Barney. You know, I do not believe all this stuff cute and adorable, it's not them. And I know for a fact that Robin hates nicknames. Thank you, Robbie Engineering. You're finished with the sports page, Sherbs? It's T-Mose. T-Mose was great. I think of the show. They're probably playing the bagpipes on the shower chair. Enough. The game is over. It's going to come. You see, I knew it was wrong. You two were too happy, too radiant, too ""surnomants"". It was not right.Never disputes? Crap. You argue all... the... time. Phil told me. Your downstairs neighbor. And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations? I knew it! I knew you were too cute and perfect! I knew you were lying. Get up early for the feint-T Mose."
1237,5,6,,"Ted (2030): In autumn 2009, a new couple moved just above.We had not met but you could hear all the time. They kept... children, say they did not stop ""playing the bagpipes."" Ted (2030): I decided to go to the bar to be quiet. It was not really that. Ted (2030): The days of Barney and Robin continued to be happier than ever. (At the bar, Barney and Robin dance) and Marshall and Lily have continued to argue. Ted (2030): And I heard more than a bagpipe parade of St. Patrick. Ted (2030): And suddenly, I found how to get the real scoop on Barney and Robin. Ted (2030): Robin and Barney told Lily and Marshall to their disputes. And let's just say, in comparison, their quarrels dishes seemed bland. Ted (2030): And in the end, Lily and Marshall had the same reaction. Ted (2030): And once the first fight set, all the others, well, they are also regulated."
1238,5,7,alan ,"I repeat, I'm Alan Thicke. How do you know? Content that is either mentioned it again. Clip? The video for ""Sandcastles""! It was also this together. We had this issue of Canadian variety that missed. It was so shameful. Imagine what would happen if someone put their hands on it?"

1240,5,7,barney ,"Your girlfriend? This is your girlfriend!? It is small and it's your friend? Do not humanize the enemy. But, delighted. Come on. Open it. It's p*rn collection! Just kidding. It would be weird. This is my collection of p*rn! I offer you my p*rn. Now that it goes really well with Robin, I need more. What does that mean? What?! I have no love handles. This is ridiculous. We gotta go. Goodbye, my dear friends. You were always there for me. We will miss you. If you watch this tape, and I knew it... is that you are in possession of all my p*rn. It can only mean two things, either I'm dead or I'm in a committed relationship. If I died, I want you honor my memory by taking my body in the Hamptons and recreating Weekend at Bernie. I want to dance. I want to make love. And I want to go fishing. If, on the other hand, I'm in a relationship, as best friend, I have one favor to ask. Please, for God's sake, get me out of here! I can look happy, but do not believe it. Barney Stinson is suited for celibacy. (Marshall and Lily have joined Ted) Out of pity, if our best friends account... And yes, Marshall, I'm his best friend, how you take it? So, get me out of here. And finally, since you hoping to see some p*rn... (Barney turns the camera towards the bed where a woman waits) Do not worry. The green light means it is off. It was Legen... wait... the Autumn. Legends of the Fall!It was fun. Sorry, I have my own way tonight. Super. Relations are deadly... Exchanges and compromise... Monogamy is the best. Tagline! More hungry... I can... in a minute. Did you notice that the beef ribs were absolutely disgusting, but recently they have become delicious? Are you kidding?! How could I not be? It's Robin! Can you ask me this question. We argue constantly, but you know what they say about relationships, ""Every moment is a battle."" And you know what happens right after a fight? Gender reconciliation. What is different... when you're in a loving and lasting relationship. Stack we make love, we order a pizza face and it stays there to moan. What was the pizza again? It's face. s*x... I'm right? Fortunately, it is becoming rare. I'm still hungry. You're hungry? What? No, this is not one. They had the wrong table. You can imagine we are married? Your business is already in my apartment. And for your naturalization. My mother would be so happy. No reason not to do so. We get married! No, I do not think. (The woman bends down to pick something she brought down) No, actually, I do not know... This is Meg. I do not compare in my mind there. Can you pick me? It's not a doll. It's a stormtrooper. No, it's protective armor. Come on. You know, I'm sick. The jokes about magic, the stormtrooper... thank you God, the song is over. Who was the old devil who sang? She was the wife of Archie in All in the family, or the same voice? I never make fun of an old lady paralyzed vocal cord... I'm not happy. Finally, I would be. Nothing would make me happier than to be happy, but... I'm not. We love scotch. It is awesome. Exactly. Two awesome cancel out, and... I'm tired of being canceled. I think. Shit. Following happens. After which you and I can not become friends again. It's not a stormtr... We're going from here? Friends that are found. I like it. And then who knows? Maybe in 40 years, if you have not found anyone... It's true. Thin. Maybe in 39 years, if you have not found anyone... Dad returned. What do you mean ""too""?"
1241,5,7,lily ,"Voluntarily, you abandon your p*rn...? You're really serious. He really is growing at a time. My God, matte videos. The orgy of space? The surprise party of 23 students naughty? You can get rid of it. Are you sure? It's nothing. We can go around back and throw the box in the trash. Because... Let's go. A more. I Tail-Dalle. Yeah. It's called Tail-Dalle. We're sure he had done? No, of course. This is an old tape. Barney is pleased with Robin. So what you did last night? How do you go? They love each other. They are perfect together. Of course, my heart. It's a bad time. It takes time to get used to each other. They are... How do you say ""selfish"" nicely? Independents. Every relationship goes through there. It's a bad time. Let us do things. Two against one, Ted. Let them. Forget. I took my retirement. I no longer. I swear, I gave up these shots there. I became legit. I am now matchmaker. I just started. I know, but I learned the lesson. I no longer interferes. I let things. But the one that's me. What did you do? I'm furious now. It will not? Oh, my God! I'd love to! You have lost your mind? You knew they were playing that first deflates, and what? You give them an engagement ring!Okay, that's good. I care. I return to the center stage for a final rupture. They are up to their necks. A single argument will not suffice. We must revive the four largest arguments they've ever had, at one time. Number one, the battle of dirty dishes. Number two, the conflict of ex-girlfriends. Number three, the altercation Star Wars. And, of course, the biggest, the Canadian-American War. Poor kid. This is how it will happen. They are the restau... (Lily imagines the scene) First, it rekindles debate US-Canada, when Alan Thicke, a native of Ontario, going to their table. They are always in contact. I had his number on the mobile Robin. Seriously... amateurs. (She plunges into the scene) So, Alan Thicke stimulus battle USA / Canada. Just then, Meg-the-crazy happens. Then, a stormtrooper happening in the street.And just when they are tired, a diver passes with a basin full of what? Dirty dishes. Get in the car. They did not stormtrooper so I had to take another robot. It will work also. Of course they are robots! ""Must k*ll Luke Skywalker"" We need it here. It is in hiding. Give a hand to the stormtrooper. No, go up. Wait... When they blew the Death Star with thousands of stormtroopers it was human? You know what? Everyone, stop! Alan thicke, close it!Marshall is a break. Put-in-t. Ted, stop talking about p*rn. And for God's sake, give the pizza stormtrooper! Damn! They see us. This is my masterpiece. And then they saw us? It will work anyway. Alan Thicke, to you. Go ahead. They kiss? They should not! Why it does not work? What am I doing? All this was a mistake. Where is Barney? I love that you are always so many friends after this clip."

1243,5,7,man 2," Sorry for the delay. I was looking for a van.  I greet between Robin?  I do not want to play with celebrities, but I have a dinner tonight, so...  Come on, I'm Alan Thicke!"
1244,5,7,marshall ,"This is obvious. Nothing, it's just, you know, you have love handles. It's nothing. Once you're with someone, it is natural to let some go. Trust me. It's been there. You'd think after 22 celebrations, students would no longer surprises. I read six of the words you just said about this jacket. So what? They are happy. So you're what? What...? I thought I had seen in one take. My favorite cop show. We are two dominant sets. If they are not happy, why not break? I think the first who plays Barney deflates. It's true... I had a friend astronaut, totally in love with his fiancee. On the eve of her mission, she surprised him with four other girls and two guys. It has become intense. She ended up sneaking into the space shuttle... Yeah. She's right. I'll get to the point, and ask you a question. Are you happy with Robin? So you're happy? So you're happy? We must break them. You're right. Barney and Robin are unhappy together but they are too stubborn to admit it. We must make the break. We will release... the Kraken. But you're the best. Please. You've got to break. This relationship is k*ll*ing them. How? That sucks. Why not let Barney be tempted by a sexy girl? (Barney wipes his hands on his shirt) Okay, going to the ring. A surveillance van. It should take one. We have ordered pizza, watched through binoculars and said, ""That's not why I signed,"" or stuff like that. What next? Oh yes. Robin was known when she sang. It takes a surveillance van! A Break? Really? You have rented a station wagon? A Break? Very bad robot voice. Barney Five... order something. It continues. The server supports a second sheet. Thank you! Stop and think only of money. Thank you! It was the Death Star. They did not sign in the wind. You're sure they've seen us? Forget it is located. If you try something, they'll know it's us. We should all go... It was a bad spot. So, how is Barney?"

Shut up. Shut up. Okay. Decides that the piece. Face. You do not have the right to do this to me. From this! That's what I mean. How does it feel in my champagne? Please, shut up. I thought you had mentioned, sorry. (The waiter brings them two glasses of champagne) This is an engagement ring?Are you...? We're committed to one another. Easier for taxes. ""Scherbatsky"" is hard to spell. Yeah, I guess. Not so loud, shit. You will be my bridesmaid? You do not know any that girl over there? Really? You're not a bit old for that stupid doll? He wears a diaper. A stormtrooper? Rather a storm-merdeur. It looks like your storm-merdeur the changes we need. I said nothing. You know Neil Young is my favorite musician. Neil Young is a Canadian treasure. Do not make fun of Neil Young. It was broken. Look at us. It is horrible all the time like that? What are we doing wrong? We love. If it does not work, what then? We are so similar. That might be it. There may be too great there. Me too. We separate? It's maybe not a break. This is perhaps... two friends... who find themselves. It's a stormtrooper? In addition, Alan. One for the Road? I am already involved with Ted. Well, I think. It may take a while to recover, but... You had a thrill? It is getting it soon. You then."

That's not how you write ""Buckminster Fuller."" I get rid of this horrible P*rn*gr*phy on the field. There is no reason to take it seriously, though? I spotted this girl there, and I will need help to land the plane. They k*ll. Barney and Robin are in love, but they are more Barney and Robin. They are big and old. This is obvious. Barney eats too much because he hates to lose his freedom. Robin and stress because she hates what has become Barney. It might be the problem. They are too similar. It's hard to have two dominant in a relationship. They are too stubborn. Neither wants to be the first to admit he no longer wants. They play at first that deflates. Talk about Space Orgy? What next? Find me someone. It's two against one. No need for it. We can do it alone. When I was with Robin, you remember the only thing that made pinball? What are you talking? If Robin thinks for one second that Barney wants to marry her, she Petera a lead and they will break. What? The server arrives. I've found. I have found. They maile images reminding those fights. Alan Thicke? This is your masterpiece. A van costs $ 25 more. What is that thing? Another robot? The stormtroopers are not robots. No one said this in Star Wars. A film of Barney begins like that. Now you mention the movie. A van is more expensive. If you work the costume, they will pay us. $ 25! You were in this video? The guy with the tan of a farmer? Come on. We find something else. Because they love. I thought that I would not say that this coir, but... Robin and Barney, the happy couple."

Ted (2030): But over time I began to notice things. Barney and Robin have stopped their crazy adventures. Ted (2030): Barney stopped being himself. Ted (2030): And Robin was annoyed when he opened his mouth. Ted (2030): But it got worse... more Ted (2030): The more they said everything was fine. In truth, Barney and Robin had just let go. But after a few weeks for us, they looked like that. Ted (2030): I left them alone. But this weekend there... Ted (2030): Children, as you know, earlier this year I learned that Lily had broken no one, not two, but seven of my past relationships. Ted (2030): So Lily went on with his plan. First, Alan Thicke.Followed by Meg-the-wild. Then the robot. And finally, the dirty dishes. But after all that... Ted (2030): This is when we learned that relationships are hard but ultimately, everything comes right. Ted (2030): And that's when we have forgotten the lesson they had learned ten seconds.

1254,5,8,barney ,"All women of New York. That's right, Barney Stinson is back on the market. Mother, lock your daughters. Daughters, lock your MAQACENJaR. You have the right answer! Since I went out with Robin there is a trick that I have not used as much as I wanted. It is... rather large, surprisingly heavy, with the skin, and it's black. My friends, this is the book of... Roles. The Roles book contains all the scams, trickery, deception, underhand, cunning, nonsense, and embobinages tricks I used, or expected use, to nab the girls and do their business. It's all there. Everything, starting from the basic, like Le Bois Do Not Ca... Do not drink it. I saw a guy put something. This guy. Glad you asked. The Lorenzon Von Matterhorn will be my comeback on stage. Or, you know, in my bed. In fact, my bed is on a stage. I put it on a platform and installed lighting. A real production. Barney goes! My hen, Ted did not miss much. She is brainy, boring, a bit boring in bed. In fact it would have been perfect for Ted.Oops! (Lily hits him) If I had known she was there for Ted, I would have obviously not done, but... given the circumstances, I think Ted would be proud of me. I managed The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. Glad you asked. To achieve the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn is what you need, basic knowledge in web design and a truly unique fake name. So think about your fake name right away. You? Fine.Now choose your target. (It is now at the bar) Preferably a girl with a great big... phone. (He approaches the counter Shelly installed) Yeah that's me. I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. Yes. You do not know who I am, does not it? It feels good for once. Nice to meet you... Shelly? Again, I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. It is written as it is pronounced, with two ""T"". (He leaves) Then, once you leave, she takes out her phone and tries Lorenzo Von Matterhorn on the Internet. And that's when she discovers... A series of fake websites, all devoted to the incredible life of Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. A false item of business on Lorenzo, the hermit billionaire. The fake of the Explorer Club newsletter on his trip to the North Pole in an airship, a feat of imagination and challenge. The fake medical journal with a story to make you cry the doctors saying that a reduction of the pen1s is not an option. And time to return... (Barney returns to Shelly) I hate to be cheeky, but I can offer you a coffee? How much is a coffee today, $ 50? And here we go. Why would it be inconsolable? The airship of Lorenzo will not disappear in the Arctic for a week. Sorry if this is that someone told her that it was lies. Oh my God! Well, I hope you are pleased with you. Thou hast broken my heart. You! She will never trust a man. You've spoiled for Ted.Not to mention Julio Von Matterhorn, the twin brother of Lorenzo. Actually, I'm in a top secret government space program called Secret NASA... Sn&aring;sa. No Moon you know, but I went on Slune. Tours to two euros?! None of these towers is. The Tower A except two Euros. I am the bassist for Tower Two Euros. And even that involves expensive hair extensions. Now, if you allow, I have to prepare for the event tonight. The I exécuterais he will not come.Glad you asked. The To run it will not come, you will need the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Got it? Fine. For generations, this is the place chosen by New Yorkers for reunion with their lost lovers of view, you need to go to every girl and say, ""He will not come."" Let it go. (He goes to another woman) He will not come.(Then another) He will not come. She's not coming? Sorry. (The woman leaves) Until... He will not come. I tried the he will not come, and it worked. Monstrous.You should have seen this girl. So, we came up to me, and I go to my room to prepare the camera... lighting candles... and when I go out, nobody, paper and more roles! We all know who is responsible for that. Al-Qaeda. You... enfoirée dirty! An actress. Of course. That explains his perfect diction and style of Drag. You would not dare. You did not say nonsense. Slim. I was abandoned at the altar. Only if you rub hard enough. If you wonder, I would be at McLaren's playing a character from the Book of roles being called The Diver. That's all. Now you want to know what the diver. In fact, it was on the last page of the Book, but I pulled in case. But do not worry.You will see it in action. You see the blonde next to the bar?Cizzible repérizzée. Forget it, kid. If anyone should be angry with me, this is Robin. She loves the book. But what...? The Book of the Rolls, this is gold. Granted this is truly spectacular. I did not know you felt it. I was so caught up with my own projects as... Damn, she looks out there. Quickly dispersed. Hello, Claire. I am Lieutenant Frank Lyman. I train dolphins b*mb detectors for... You know what? I can not do that.Robin, I'm sorry. I think this break is harder for me than expected.The Book of roles was just a way to change my mind. Is it true? Claire, you must have heard a lot about the real Barney tonight. Want some coffee? A Pringles, but still. Step one, talk to a friend Book Roles. Step two, play with one of his colleagues and make angry she steals the Book.Step three, put the combi and say you will do a final round, The Diver with the sexy girl next to the bar. Your friend, let's call her Lily, told him everything about the book. Now the hard part.When Lily and daughter are questioning The Diver, remove the mask, and pull out the stops on your deepest insecurities that do not exist because you are awesome. Sad for you, Lily talks about you to the girl who agrees to have coffee. And... is... gone."

Three years ago, Shelly started working at my school.When I saw her, I said, ""It's perfect for Ted."" He is. It is so great and attentive and intelligent. I do not see it. It must be voluntary. So, another bar? It still is. And you're ready. I will fix it but promise me not to do anything stupid. You should! You should! You should! And you met him at McLaren's? What is the name there? You... dirty b*st*rd. Bluntly. I had put aside for Ted Shelly for 3 years. Exactly, yes. What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn? It's horrible. You realize you've broken her heart? She is inconsolable. It was all lies. Lies! Lies! Men... Actually, that's true. I went there. Lies! What? Me? Do you believe? He says it's my fault. And by the way, Ted, I bet she go out with you again. That must bother you a bit. Well, Barney, you go out... You just get out of a sincere relationship. You're a big boy now. You can return to your towers to two euros. Yes, we know. No, you idiot. That was me. An actress friend. I'm almost to the point of taking this book and put it on the net for everyone to see. No, as you stop scams and confidence tricks, deception, underhand, tricks, schemes and embobinages. No more nonsense! A few hours later... It's good. I put the Book of Roles on the Internet. Baby, you can put the Book of Roles on the Internet? Barney, no. You are... It's good. You see that guy over there in diving suit? And here we are. So what does the diver? Claire and here, in passing. I'm delighted that you stop it. And frankly, the real Barney is better than all the false Barney's Book of Roles. Before refusing, you should know that in this neoprene combined with what appears to be a pair of socks... I had a message from Barney. ""Look under the table."" (She looks under the table and finds an envelope) A page from the Book of Roles. You dirty b*st*rd...!"

Another chicken and stick to you the crown! But you can put three times more than chicken fingers in your mouth. You know. I agree. You've seen one called The Sn&aring;sa? Grave. It's like that. Have you any idea how many times in my life when I went to look for frozen waffles frozen in vain? Millions. But when I go in search of a mirror or the remote because Lily and I had an argument and she has hidden there, whereupon I fall? Frozen waffles. It's like that. You go out to get the newspaper, but you come back with frozen waffles.And there, frozen waffles he's a guy. As long as you're there, you take it back frozen waffles? And there, frozen waffles are... frozen waffles. And yet this is not the worst. Do you saw My pen1s grants wishes? It's not very well designed. This is not Ms. Stinsfire. Sure baby, but there is something odd. I flipped through the whole book. There is no role called The Diver. I have no idea. And it's k*ll*ing us, Claire. It kills us! She is getting married. I have to check my tuxedo. It's a coffee, huh? I'm proud of him. It takes a lot of Pringles to be as vulnerable. It is. You say you do not want a relationship. Well, the love of your life will not pass this door, and this is... this kind. Right, because here it is. It is this type! (A woman enters) Let him at least a chance. Get out a bit with it, see if it can give something. Yeah, right."

It's unlikely, I focus on my career, finished the rencards. It's good but... I answer? It's good for them... It's his life. These girls had it coming if they are stupid enough to be fooled. If you fall in there, you break my heart, but sorry, you're sdébile. I'll fetch the newspaper. You must stop, seriously. The last thing I'm looking for now is a relationship. Thousands? What happened? I'm leaving. Sorry to interrupt but check it out. I did not worship the book. We just broke. The costumes are nice, but... it just broke. It's okay. It's hard for me too. Look at me. I gave up on relationships. I'll knock your heads like two coconuts. It's a good guy. It's nothing. It says what? I will not fall in love with him. No comment. The blue jacket, it does not suit me, so... I will work. I'm really going to work. Yes. Damn, Marshall."

I know you? You are, kind known? Shelly. Yes! Please. It was all lies? The expedition in the airship? The artificial island in the shape of his face off Dubai?

""Six months later... Married! It happens, whatever you say. It is a law of nature. Trust me. I would not get interested in relationships. I would not be single if I wanted to be single. Ready for what? Why do not you talk to me now? Yeah she was pretty. I promise to do anything stupid. I'm thinking. Do I want to date a girl that Barney was typed?Help me for harmonies. Of course. Or rather, look for a husband. Taking the newspaper, think to watch the ads for marriages.For yours. No. Oh, my god, it's horrible. I wonder if it works. He starts singing and objects come alive and dance with him. Apparently, it will rain. I will prepare my toast. Come on, go out with him. It's The Diver. Yes, because it is... this kind."
1262,5,8,woman ,"No. How do you know? And the diving suit? What? Who? Thank you. So, he got Shelly? It must have upset you. What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn? You're an astronaut? Sn&aring;sa? You went to the moon and everything? The Slune. So, then? What are you talking about? No? But we agreed. We always said we would meet again here. Tonight it. I'm an idiot.

Uncle Barney was very good on this last point, although many times it was someone else. Ted (2030): There are two basic ways to behave after a breakup.Some are dedicated solely to... Ted (2030): While others are dedicated solely to... Barney:... Until more advanced maneuvers, such as the Ms. Stinsfire. Ms. Stinsfire: Hello, girls! Ted, with chicken fingers in the mouth: This girl is super nice with Lily! Ted (2030): And I kept that promise. But just because... it never came. All, making the chorus: No way... Barney, entering: Everyone, code red! Emergency. Lock.Nobody gets out. Lily:... is an incredible kind. He's funny and it's one of my best friends. And he came out with this g*n.

Robin arranges her hair, I jump! I jump all the time. It's bad for my skin. It gives me wrinkles. Wrinkles! This is torture. Put me in the chair... And finish it! This is interesting. It's a good point. Rebuttal? philosophical riddle. Idea against execution. Itemize your arguments. Repeat-a. The first seven! You're gonna... I guess this is the best choice, Robin. Finally... the men are stronger than women. And that's what you always wanted, is not it? A strong man to take care of you? Of course, teenager, you were a feisty, playing hockey with the boys, you skinned your knees on the ice. But what you could say to your teammates... or even to yourself... that is all you really wanted was this pretty white dress in this beautiful white chapel. And at the end of the aisle strewn with pretty white flowers, a man to take care of all your slaps. Commissioner of the bet-Baffe, tie me to the chair is a violation... This is the worst. It's downright hell. It hurts! thank you God. No way! Gently! thank you God. You're kidding me. No. No, no, no, no. It is the Commissioner of the bet-Baffe. It must remain impartial! It's not good.

You should pay rent to live in the basement of your parents. Working? You are retired. You not only prevented them from moving to Florida but you obliged to rework grandfather? What is he doing here? I want to see him! Returns it! The equity in my life brings me nothing but stress. It's easier that he is dead to me. This is our journal. Thank you, girls. A coffee, please. But only if it is decaf. I want to sleep tonight. I'm sorry. Are you sure mine is decaf? You used the same coffee. OK (She leaves the grocery store, coffee in hand. In his bed while sleeping Marshall)... You dirty b*st*rd! (It returns in pajamas to the grocery store) It was not decaf! No. You did not ask. Tell him it's just important that it is here. In less than two, it will be a games convention in Toledo, to give money to your dental apparatus in a so-called Milton Bradley. No, that's what mom was doing with his two jobs. This man broke my heart every day for 20 years. It's easy for you to say that, you come to the family the most ridiculously close to the world. Really? And the Eriksen family dinner every Sunday? I'm sorry but it's weird. I can not believe you take her part. Let me be clear. This man will never set foot in this house, ever! Wait, how you know all this? You've invited?! I do not believe you. What gives you the right to do that? Marshall, I came here because I was cold and it was the only place that was open. I would not even look at Mr. Park in the eye. And then I discovered that... Mr. Park's death. He really died for me. And if I feel so bad to have never forgiven Mr. Park, a guy who literally did not mean anything to me? We have to get my father. Less talking shop, more slaps. The Commissioner of the bet-Baffe says it's good. Close your eyes. It will soon be over. I can not do it. Why I can not do it?"

You have brought back an old turkey replacement.Why I have not listened to the message of former mayor Ed Koch saying not to forget my business. Yes! It's my turkey! Come here, my beautiful little enfoirée! You're the best friends in the world! I do not know what to say. It's Thanksgiving, but ""thank you"" does not seem enough. Yes, and you know why? Because I love you. And I'll show you how. Ted Mosby and Robin Scherbatsky, I bring you... the fourth slap. Certainly not. Unless you were thinking... ""Baffegiving two: Revenge of the lower"" in this case, yes, that's what I'm saying! Lily is the curator of the bet. Life is short. I tell myself, Baffe Diem. A rule, the slap must be given before sunset to avoid interference dinner Lily. Two, you must decide which of you will. Three, we will attach to the chair Barney, now be called The Throne of Baffe. It fits you? Rita, you are anxious... to move to Florida? They surprised you with a girl? I do not know but we should bring him in and discover. Stay there, okay? We will solve the problem. Lily, go. It's been 3 years. This is long enough. I've supported when our neighbor, Mr. Sias, died in your sight. And when Whitney, your maid of honor, had died in your sight. I even understood when Mr. Park to the grocery store downstairs was dead in your eyes. I've supported with these unknowns, but it's your father, okay? We can at least give him some turkey? Go. Please, I can not ask him to leave at Thanksgiving. He was trying to earn money to feed his family. So we can give pieces of chicken not cooked. It's your family. And I'm sorry but we do not separate the family. It is not ridiculously close. A family must be close like that. And I want our future family is. And that includes your father. It will take about 5 minutes. It's a disease? Your father has made mistakes in the past, but it has changed. He moved out of your grandparents. He has a job. He pays his taxes. Gender, body language. Okay, we had a drink last week. Yeah, kind, all the time. She tells this story all the time... No, not a word. But that does not have to be like that.We can fix that, right? And right before my eyes, your father broke down in tears. (Actually, it's Marshall who starts crying) Stop it! You come to Thanksgiving! The poor man was sobbing. What could I do? A fool and called him a girl, what I found unjustified. You and I are married. So it is also part of my family.(Marshall will open the door for the third time) Enter. It must be half an hour. We should get Lily. We should really get Lily. You come here and you watch your daughter go without care. And now you destroy the Thanksgiving dinner! Lily is on it since this morning! This is my look ""you're dead to me."" Get out of my house! In Mr. Park... I was not expecting to find you here. Lily, I'm sorry. Just let me express myself. I thought the family was right but it's wrong. It is a privilege, and it deserves it. I put your father out. And I promise you, baby, I do... you never force her to see him again. (Lily starts to cry) What? Baby, what has happened? You just 2 minutes. You decided which of you will be entitled to a slap in the face to Barney? Because... the slap did exactly what I hoped. It brought us together. And it forced us to recognize the weakness and at the same time the greatness in ourselves and in others. And so... there will not slap... of... today. 4! So the turkey?"

And bile horse. What is it? It does what? Yeah, Lily does it better... Really? It's a bit weird for me, I just met Barney and I have nothing against him but how many times have we a chance to slap someone in the face? I'm sorry. I can not do it. I know I have not been a good father. So for all dance recitals that I missed, for all the art exhibitions that I should attend... for the wedding that I was not able to offer you...

We have one hour before sunset, and none of us baffera Barney. I slipped a note of the type 20! I paid the taxi. What? You said it was fine. Why did not you say anything? You really want to slap Barney the point of lying and pretending to be in love with me? This slap is mine, Mosby. I never slap Barney... above the belt. And I would not slap? My God, you're right. This fruit has changed in immaculate slap-poisoned apple. You know what? Seriously, do it. Baffe-solument. Leads to me! It's gonna be Ted. Last year you were abandoned at the altar. You lost your job. You did so along way. I am so proud of you, Ted. You deserve to slap someone in the face as hard as you can. Yes I can not do it. I can not take that away from you, Ted.

I really want to slap! Robin Shit! I knew Barney first. This is for me to slap. I want to slap Barney since I met him! One second.

Your challenge not interest me but you're cheating. Wear a suit under the overalls. Oh it does not tell you goodnight, he tells you how he feeds his horses. I could sit there and tell jokes Farmer on you all night. Challenge accepted. It was a big tractor 3-axis. Relax, everything is under control. I know a little something about loving to men... you see me as one of those magnets that can not put a picture of your children on the fridge. But I am one of these magnets... that can pick up cars in scrap yards...! (Robin returns to the table where she finds a man with Maggie) Who is it? Oh, well... hello you! Funny? I think it's hilarious. In fact, I liked so much that I think I'm pissed. I'd love to! Ted, change of plans! Oh, it's not possible! I love pictures of dogs ironic. You got it there with the dog Welsh dwarf who is a missionary? And if you took a glass of wine first? (It shatters his glass on it voluntarily) Oooh boy! I'm dirty, it's me! I'm just a dirty, dirty girl... that would defeat the second base with a friend of a friend.Tui love it! It's pig! Oh my God, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie. Leave her alone!Lord, she goes out with Ted tonight. They have broken. It tells me nothing! She's gone! I told him to return. You were like vultures... fighting for his carcass.

1302,5,10,ted ,"Since Lily and Marshall have their apartment, her mother keeps sending him old things she wants to get rid. Hello? Yes. What? The window is open. Lily, the window is open. Fight your way, watercourse Ted, run! Hey, Maggie. I was just, you know, hmm... How are you? Oh, sorry for you. Wanna go out tonight? I arrived! You see how everyone knows a person, and whatever happens, this person is perfect for you. Well this girl was and still is Maggie Wilks. It was not the fact that Maggie was good. It was the... It was the perfect girl next door. And still is. All the guys who meet Maggie fall madly in love with her. And that's the problem. Since I know her, she has been single for only three short windows of time. When she moved here and broke up with her boyfriend in college, I waited one month, not to go for the spare wheel. And the spare wheel well, he stayed two years. After their breakup, I have waited a week. Late again. She stayed with guys for 3 years. The third time, I was super fast. I got not even one hour after their breakup. The only thing she has made between the break and I arrived, it's down to her mail. Late again. And she went out with him four years. I would not let me have it again. So I begged her neighbor, Ms. Doglas, call me when she and David have broken loose. And now, a single and Maggie is available along the way to this bar right now. I made him take a taxi with a woman driver for there is no interaction with a man, so far. Ok, game plan Maggie arrives, a few minutes of gathering and presentation, and everyone leaves us. This is my only chance, and I will not go wrong. Damn! I want you to Maggie Robin, my roommate. I completely forgot, I teach a class tonight. How would you like to come and see what happens during an architecture? Super. Sit down, put yourself at ease. Relaxed, everything is relaxed. Listen, you want me to find the perfect girl for you so all together, it's her. Do not let a guy to approach her. No server to take our order, clean the table, and if it ignites, I want a female firefighter to extinguish. Marshall Good God, do what you need to keep single until my return. I pay the bill, but do not abuse. Good evening, tonight we will quickly see the different bridges. There are 6 types of bridges, small, large, with suspension and three others. You land on each side and water in the middle. See you next week. Who wants to hear me talk about bridges for 1 hour? (All raise their hands) Really? One important thing to remember when designing a bridge. No. Finally yes. When you design a bridge remember: ""Make Adjustments... Fetch energetically"" (""Make Ajustments Energize Go Get It"" Maggie acronym in English) Good advice in general too. No, I mean it's just that girl that interests me very long time.And tonight this is my chance to get away with it. Yes Jamie, she is very pretty. We can now finish the course. Betty? Bluntly. I think. Perhaps. I dunno, you think what? You're left with Maggie Robin? You do not understand, this girl is like a magnet to men... overkill. What does mean to be ready? I thought I was ready last year and I was left on the altar. I'll be honest. I'm scared! Ok, Luis and Betty! I mean, if you're not afraid you do not try your luck... and if you do not try your luck then... What are you doing? Not? Ok, I gotta go! Hello? You let him with Barney? You're an animal! 10 minutes? How could you? Put yourself on the line Bob! I'm in love with her for 12 years! Guys, guys, guys! We must fix that. Wait, where is Maggie? What? Wait, she's right. Maggie deserves a little time for her.Nobody likes to be alone, especially after a break but... This is where we discover who we really are... and what you really want. She deserves it! Oh, sorry, the course we had a little... Who is it? Yeah, sure! Well... I'll see you next time! I do not want the ""giddy ups."" That's what I want. I had forgotten how it felt to seeking the real thing... but I think I'm ready again."

Would you like to see a photo of the cutest dogs in the world? Good boy! So I teased him a little with the newspaper like that, and my wife said, you can not treat your son as well. Michael calls for help."
1307,5,11,barney ,"I just let something like that to my apartment. The new head of legal department is Hobes Arthur. Not great, it does not matter that Arthur Hobes not like Marshall, he loves no one. It is the people he knows that he has to separate. He just fired, ""What's his head? "". Yeah, after you turn'm doing... then you can k*ll you. As ""What is his head? "". Now I think it is, where is his head? Do you remember when you could smoke in bars? Hey, this is a chair, but go ahead and drag it. You're right. Going for a smoke. I'm not a smoker. I do not smoke on certain occasions.After s*x, when I'm with German, sometimes both at the same time. During s*x, for birthdays, to annoy my mother, just before s*x, on a sailboat. The day the mentor MC mailly eliminated each year, and of course... wait, because God knows it's true: fear of pregnancy. I'm always on the verge of sleep Ted. And my abs muscle nicotine. I... am... muscular. My God, I hope that Arthur is well. I reserve her office in case. I'm proud of you guys. I heard how it was difficult to stop smoking for as you, then the part of non-smokers, I tell you hat, so give me your cigarettes and I rid, one at a time. It's too stressful! I do not bite my nails, I try to suck the rest of nicotine on my fingers. What do cigarettes now? You believe they think of us? I have a hiding on the roof. Oh, I woke up and I smoke. Robin, you know how it's dangerous to wake a smoker sleeps. Come on, let's do it."

Oh, look at the teleprompter is still running. Something about a woman giving birth... on a bus. Well, we will not resume in the middle, we'll wait until the end. And, she cut the cord with a metro ticket. We come back! And it's good! Robin, you're a bit like a nice kid but this is my 39th local newspaper. And all this time I learned three things: prevention of all sushi restaurants at will before work. Do not go to the bathroom while you're still on the air. And 3: at this time, all your audience... it's a guy who is half drunk and in his underwear. The guy in half drunk thank you. What are you doing? My God, you are adorable. The mayor does not come in emissions that no one is watching. My colonoscopy was more viewership. It was well twisted I admit. I've already spent on the cable. It was the best weekend of my life. When you do the newspaper, you're sitting on ergonomic seats, you feel like sitting on a cloud, which was good also because it was just after my colonoscopy. And the locker room, wow. Oh yes there was the break, Mike. We will not change in the toilets of KFC on the other side of the street. Oh no. It was heaven. But once you get used to, they will not care at the door to find someone who is not undergoing divorce, or who is not addicted to gin. And before you know it, you find yourself in a dead end, surrounded by people who are going nowhere in their careers, making these programs in their underwear. You are beautiful guys. It's comfortable eh? Oh my little princess porcelain, why would you do that? I begin to believe that it becomes personal. The mayor canceled. You think I'm a loser? You're right, I'm a but at least I accept it. I was like you at first, I always wanted more, and I had nothing. This is a dead Robin, you'll never be a superstar of television. Since you never stop smoking. I like my cigarette. Oh that's good. Want a latte? Yes professional, you know who holds the camera? A chair, even the cameraman is not looking our show and that's why the mayor has canceled. And Mike went to fast food, and that you and I can enjoy a cigarette here. Why? Because there are millions of viewers? If viewers are problems with this, call us at the number on the screen: 212-555-0192. Go robin, appreciate life a little. (She takes the cigarette when the phone rings) It must be Mike, he always forgets to take them into extra-crunchy."

Now give me the cigarettes! And the lighter. (Lily lights a cigarette) Aaah, that thing! We saw. Maybe that smoking is not so bad, at least it is outdoors. Me too. You stop my chick. (She removes the cigarette from his hands) I know I did not call you chick normally, but it does with that voice. Chick. You can sleep with Marshall. Sorry darling, that's for the team. Give a cigarette! Barney stops eating your fingers. Yes sweetie, and you are very pretty. Resists sweetie! We will not smoke. And this guy So what con.

Okay, I'm done, I Quit! last cigarette of my life. I'm worried about work, ok? They just hired a new chief legal department... and it will turn people. I quit! Worse! I have Marshall Eriksen. We had a pretty intense argument. As I've suggested that you take your head and you put yourself in the..., inside you. At a place that could reduce its exposure to the sun. Marshall Eriksen. It turned 'What is his head? ""Ted! And ""What's his head? ""Was priceless. Look, it's just two cigarettes. Ok, I can collect 2. As it is not 3 within 24hrs I replongerai yet. Lily did not discover. I have a system. Well, Lil '! Damn! No, no thank you! You know what? I'll take one. Marshall I am aware. It was Marshall, Marshall Eriksen. Hey! Yes, I smoked! And it was my third day. You know what that means? I'm a smoker now. Everything is ruined. I bought a packet coming back, and a lighter... and a Viking lamp that has nothing to do, but I saw in the window and I liked it. It was to create a link with my boss, you should have seen me up there. It's a beautiful dog. And it is your children? It's black, or silver. A lot of people... Bedrin the insomniac, who portrays Blongs front of department stores. People to the emergency room where the TV is in a cage, and you can not change channels. Marco? It's alright, darling? Yes, right away, and me is Marshall. I would never have started. I finally revisit in 13 years, if I could go back. (Young Marshall went camping with a buddy and they smoke. Older Marshall arrives and pat the hand of young Marshall to drop the cigarette. It gives him a punch in the stomach) I hate that little b*st*rd. Yes, we stop. Actually, we all decided to stop. Lily God, no. Sure. Just one. Really, it's hard enough like that? What, you're a dinosaur? Oh Ted, I'm sorry, maybe I should move closer to your ass! Robin, do not smoke this cigarette. They look at you all, we are all impressed and if you smoke this cigarette, we shall return it to us too. She did! Robin Good show. The last three. Sorry to have hit my friend. I want to redeem myself by giving you this. Well one day you will marry her. Yes, lucky. Oh no, no do not do that. Have fun for me."

Don, you said Pet brain! Well, let a good program for what is half drunk. You should know that I tried to contact the town hall so we could get the mayor on the show.

And I would not keep that going. I want to k*ll him, of course people watching this show.You look at her. My God, you still have not seen the program. Really? What color is the decor? Not your TV, the decor of my show. If my best friends do not watch, will watch it... You have film crews? Hey you two, smoking, like us.

Fantastic, I was fed up that you piquiez me my smokes constantly. No. I do not want to have s*x with Marshall. I can not stop now, not before the most important interview of my life. It's too stressful. Ok, I stop. Why? Because it is important to Don, the issue is important and my career. Not like you, you incompetent. You're boring, you are bad, and I want you to work at least as hard as the elastic of your underwear. No gift, it would become personal if I told you that just because you pass emission issue, it's because you're losing. A loser lazy and obnoxious. Hello, this is Robin Scherbatsky. A raccoon has bitten a patient in a nursing home. What are you doing? You can be professional? No thank you. Marshall? You watch the show? Oh guys. Thanks for calling friends. I bought a packet on the way home. He ended up apologizing. We believe in it all. You know it's the perfect time there. For one last cigarette. The real last."

And on the couch, the bed and on the coffee table. Have fun. Robin, going, going on the roof! We said no smoking in the apartment... after that you have set fire by the pumps.

Is it always rebounded against you? Wow, he not remember you. Look, I understand you to be upset but this is not a reason to k*ll you. What will Lily say when you learn that you smoked? I can not believe they're smoking outside, it's really cold. I think there's a pretty girl smiling at me there. Guys? Our group is divided into smokers and nonsmokers, and it's great. And why you smoke there? We must stop smoking. Ok it's good, we stop. Robin, we must do together. Damn Robin, think about it a moment, Blue Bug is the mayor anti cigarette. You really want to go to the interview smelling cigarettes? It's like interviewing a feeling the vegetarian steak. You stop! It all stops. We should just spend the first 24 hours after a piece of cake. Marshall pass me your plate. Dude, if you do not stop moving your feet, I'll tear it off. Ok we'll do it now!

Ted (2030): Don was Don Franck. A veteran of the morning shows... and a former host of 38 local programs across the country watched. This guy was a legend in the middle. Ted (2030): And that's exactly what she did. She just stayed there. Okay kids, I'm a little liar with you. This is not what she did.That's what she did. Ted (2030): I promised never to tell you. But occasionally, your Aunt Robin was enjoying a cigarette. And occasionally, the occasional cigarette. Was more than just casual. Ted (2030): Children, your Uncle Marshall would not like at all that you know that. But he also smoked from time to time. Ted (2030): It started when he was 13. During an event camping in Minnesota. Ted (2030): And this was the first of many, many cigarettes last of his life. Marshall:... last cigarette... my life. Ted (2030): And then what I had heard many times before.

Don, who arrive without pants: Sorry I'm late. Someone used the microwave, and I got stuck in the elevator. What are you doing? Ted (2030): They went out together three months later. But we will come back. Lily:... two... Robin:... three. Ted (2030): We all stopped for a while after that. But this was not the last, even though we ended up really stop.

A butcher, a baker, a candle maker. Yes, we got to the part where it rhymes. A teacher, a restorative, an observer... A puppeteer, a croupier, a housewife, it is also a job, guys. A circuit court judge... I never, never slept with a barmaid sexy, until tonight. Wish me luck. Guess who will not fall under his spell? I will make him ""Do not try, baby. Papa needs a gin and tonic. ""And when she will, I recracherai saying"" Do it again. "" The dominant male where it should be: on top, and after a few minutes below. Why should I do anything?

But for these two... And, for that... Finally, for her... I'll stop wearing, wait... The costumes and complexed. I hate them. I hate them. I arrive in a second. So young. You can not do anything else? It can... As an organ donor? But I... Do it. Sorry. I know. I know. We have the remains cremated. Its buttons have saved a sick jacket of the Upper East Side. No. My costume gave his life for this cause, and I do not should rest before these two... Well, it... Finally,... Be it mine. It was Italian. Classic, elegant. And my God he knew how to deal with women. They could not say no. 7 years. I miss him so much! Thank you, old friend. You go on a good shot. It was so special, you know? We should observe a minute of silence. Followed by about 20 minutes of grunting. Okay. Expected. No, this is not the bathroom. This is... I'm the suit-sitting for someone. Costumes! Costumes! Do we see. I'll stop. These are the costumes. Stops just bullshit.Two, three, four! Girls come and depart, but the clothes remain constant! Each buddy dépote and rambling, it is no substitute!Sorry, my costumes, I give you my life. My Sunday clothes are my best friends! The casual clothes go in the basket because nothing goes better with the undisputed often praised, claiming to fame... a true... Expect more... Costume... Mind you, it is rather barrel.

Another weird thing on my roommate: she paints robots who play sports. And she has this weird habit of blackmailing his breakf. Sorry. It is not so bad. I'm just a little jealous. I discovered that the settlement on all outgoing students and teachers are very strict. I could lose my scholarship. Sorry, but I can not take that risk. My roommate is going out of the shower. Come into my room. I do not want it, me either. Really? This is my roommate. I borrowed. Birthday present... my roommate. I did not read it yet. It is in a group. It's amazing. You chose the only three things that are here to my roommate. Get out."

She will pretend to enjoy yourself in the same way she has mesmerized all these geniuses. A new super sexy barmaid. If he thinks. Do not bother to pretend that other women are not attractive just for my own good. Baby, you're an angel, but compared to this woman, I am a big trash bag 3 days. You see, it's really annoying. Now that you have been looking more closely, admit it: the bartender is the sexiest of the Bar. Baby, how can you not want you to do? I want to do it. If you do not wanna do it, sorry, but you must be gay. Why? And thoughtful. If the rules are so strict, you could put your work in. Of course, I listened carefully when you spoke.

I do not mind having it, even on the head! That night, I admit, I thought about it a little more than once. I never said that. It's not comparable. She is younger than you.

I think until you're the most beautiful woman in the world. I repeat... Yeah, I'm gay. Gay for you. Yes... You will not like the answer. I think you should leave it, buddy. Sorry for my delay. I was stuck at work. I had this presentation on taxes on dividends. So, I started the Powerpoint... (rubs Barney costume at Marshall) Barney? We will order food. I can not. You're sexier than she. What do you...? Kind, you think she is sexier than me? You think so! I'm just, like, me, my friend, against it, its old. I guess you also think she is sexier than me. What would you say, against all your costume you were offered eternal youth?"
1330,5,12,robin ,"Why it's almost that guys? We'd better find a new bar. Abbreviates! It's not so sexy. No. Shut up! You see? Marshall does not think she's sexy. The second sexiest. Is that all? Come on, you're always in costume. We know you're gonna say ""costumes"". So, your date with Cindy? Well, Ted, she's right. Finally, you can abandon the quest for so-called sexy barmaid. You two, the fact that it is not real sexy! She is sexy thanks to circumstances! Look. What? Carl, listening. No. I do not want to leave. Mercy, mercy, do not force me to leave. I was someone there, behind! Everybody loved me. What would you choose: a million girls and one three parts?"

And they will respond? Actually, it's really sexy. You go out with idiots cute? She wants to do a doctorate, she reads the philosophy for fun, she finished the crossword in the Sunday New York Times. To summarize, I have a date tonight. (We hear screaming outside) Thank you, New York! I try not to screw up. Would you jealous of the attention? Imagined would be the sexiest girl in the bar? How are you? It's cute. Sorry, I should not play with the affairs of your roommate.She look like? What? Why? Look at me. I promise, I would not fall in love with your roommate. It's strange. It's weird. Look, I am defeated. I hate it. I do not know why. You're great. Well, last night, it was nice today, less. It's not like if you followed my progress. It is not even in the same department. She exaggerates, there, right? Okay, I start again. She exaggerates, there, right? There is absolutely right. What if Cindy is the woman I am to marry, and I give up?Farewell, elegant but cozy house in Westchester, with a reasonable loan that I can pay without ruining me. Goodbye, the two children raised in a strict but loving hand, finding the perfect balance between the father and friend. Adios, triplets Schnauzers, Frank Lloyd Wright and. The fact is, I do not give up either! (Ted gets up and kissed the urn of Barney before leaving) I do not know why I did that. Can we talk? I know the law prohibits us from going out together. But he also says ""Do not teach in having drunk"" and I do it all the time.The fact is... I really appreciate you. You're cute, funny. You write a thesis which is entitled, Foreign direct investment and intergenerational ties of consumption behavior. It's too sexy! I know it sounds crazy, but... I feel that our paths are supposed to meet, and... I do not want to miss meeting you. I gotta tell you, just by looking at your room, I know we have much in common. The Unicorns? Who will cut our hair When We're Gone? I thought I was the only one with this album. And that? After World T.C Boyle? You should. It is really good. And that? It is the height. You play the bass? Seriously, ask my friends. I have always said that my perfect woman... does not play bass, because that is clearly that of your roommate. Damn, that's cool. The group played shows your roommate or...?"
1333,5,12,tim ,"Sorry, Barney. There is nothing more to do. No. But we can use the buttons on this costume to another. The death of this suit could save the life of another. You do what it takes. Do not cry about it. It's silk."
1334,5,12,,"Ted (2030): Children, you never know when you will meet someone important. It's not as if life warned you. You look, and they are there. Ted (2030): No, not this guy. It. Ted (2030): Children, do you remember the history of bad amphitheater. Ted (2030): I thought I was in architecture intro, I was in advanced eco. Of course, I did not know that your mother was in the auditorium, and she took me for an idiot. Ted (2030): That night I went to a very important first date. Ted (2030): It's funny, sometimes you walk into an apartment for the first time, but it was the feeling of being right where it should be. And children, it was the first time I saw the little yellow bus of your mother. You know him. It is right behind you. Ted (2030): And so I was there in the apartment of your mother, except that I was dating her roommate, Cindy. Ted (2030): I do not know, but I would hear the first description of the woman I would marry. Ted (2030): Oops! Ted (2030): Meanwhile, Cindy and I spent a pleasant evening, but she was not kidding about his roommate complex. Ted (2030): I lied. It looked great. The watercolor of the robot playing volleyball with your mother is still in remission. Ted (2030): The version of ""Memories"" of your mother, sung by an English muffin, is to date the most beautiful thing I've heard in my life. Ted (2030): But not as much as your mother. And speaking of things that are less brilliant, your uncle Barney was formally arrested costumes. Ted (2030): Of course they were right. I had to let her go, but as your uncle Barney was discovered, it is not always easy. Ted (2030): None of us had seen for so long without Barney costume, and children, it was not pretty. Barney, running down the street: Out of my way! Stay with me.It's not your time. Ted (2030): If someone could fix such a thing, it was the tailor personnel Barney, TV's Tim Gunn. Ted (2030): Children, as you guessed, it was not the night I met your mother. Although I think I saw his foot. But I approached the meeting with the woman of my dreams. And your mother... She had recovered her yellow umbrella. Barney, singing and dancing in the street: I know what you're thinking, ""What Barney has been drinking? This girl was hot! ""I might have to do it, but I did not miss anything because there is something she is not. 10 would make me a lot, but I'd rather be on my 31. It is a fact that you can not deny. Nothing goes better than n'me costume! Imagine a world where men and women are perfectly well-dressed! The delivery man in suit and tie savate, this puppy in a cross! This guy with sideburns, this baby with a pacifier! This gendarmette deliciously beautiful. Nothing goes better than n'leur costume! A first officer that I can wear, they are oh so distinguished! The perfect trick to get me a girl with father issues, navy blue or black! (2 men get out of a store with a rack filled with costumes) spy on this perfect rack! I want to make guilis. Marshall, doing the same: Oh, really! Then answer these questions, I beg. What would you do if you had to choose between your suits and a pot of gold? Ted, Marshall, Lily: Nothing suits her better... than... Costume.In costume! In costume! Costume...!"
1335,5,13,all ,But hum! But hum! But hum! But hum!
1336,5,13,barney ,"You heard me. With Jenkins, of Jenkins, near Jenkins. You said it, I want to put like a sock. But huh? It's funny, I also had a drinking game based on Robin, Robin finally. At the bottom of her stomach... Sorry, you're right. She did not like anyway. She said it woke her up. Does she said ""But um"" so often? Easy, that's the plan: A, layer with Jenkins. Two, I sleep with Jenkins first. Three, the second rule is the first I'm going to rule 2. Marshall, you're in the field!"
1337,5,13,boy ,"No, the third."
1338,5,13,jenkins ,"Hi Marshall. So you're really a fan of the Vikings, or he lied about that too? I'm a fan of the Vikings too! I think purple and gold. I am from Pelican Rapids. Good God, I was in a band improv. Am what I do. Hi Lily, I am of the French Embassy. I am here because of a little problem with cheese but important. Yes, well, uh, I'll let you sort it out between you, see you later. Hey buddy! Oh you're here! I'm really sorry to have embraced yesterday. And I'm sorry I slept with you in the mail room. Oh my God, that's embarrassing 2 discussions today. I do not do usually, I was totally stuffed. Yeah, I know not what has happened! But hum! (She drinks her glass bottoms up) I gotta work! Damn, how I could do that! No, you know what it is not nothing. You are the coolest guy in the office that stupid. And I really do not want to spoil our friendship. This is so embarrassing, do not tell anyone please. For heaven's sake, I have to go talk to him, I must apologize! If Marshall, I must say that it happened, it meant nothing... And I'm sorry. I'm going. So Lily, what I'm saying is that... It happened and I feel terrible. And I am truly sorry. Exactly, I feel bad and I hate myself. If what I have done you got injured or affected your relationship with Marshall, forgive me!"
1339,5,13,lily ,"This is a new lawyer in the office of Marshall, he is hilarious. I'm in a hurry to meet him. Hey baby, I go up there. There was a problem at school, it was therefore the day. I thought to visit you, eat something with a nice little dessert. Hello, I'm Lily, Marshall's wife. You are Jenkins? The famous Jenkins, gosh. I imagined a man, in short, we eat? Honey, I do not have to worry about you and another woman. Yes of course. Let's eat. Let me see. I think sometimes it's the case. No, of course not. I would say this is me, this is what is right. No, no weak or strong. And Oprah has tried everything? I think if I had to really say, maybe I'm strong. Hey baby, what do you do at home? What? Oh, I see what happens. That's about all that history of strong and weak. You wanna make me jealous so you invent a story with Jenkins. Of course it was. I'm so jealous, I'll go see it and hit right on the nose... like an old sandwich. Come on baby, you want some soup? Kissed my husband! MY HUSBAND! Nobody embraces the father of my future children besides me."
1340,5,13,man ,"In fact the myopic! New lawyer, Jenkins here. Watch out for this guy, he steals things. Oh, it's true! I think I should go, keep your $ 10!"
1341,5,13,marshall ,"Ted, I'm champion of skee-ball, since law school. I have come here at least once a month to keep my record. Yes, yes. The biggest. In fact, I must tell you something. I invited Jenkins. You will not believe what Jenkins has done this time. Hilarious! There was a jar of cherries in the fridge, then Jenkins said: $ 200 and I eat the whole pot. So we gave him $ 200, and he ate the whole jar! The CFO comes to sign papers, then Jenkins said: Excuse me Mr Wilkocs, I think we forgot one of the documents.We all went to a bar after work, Jenkins goes on the table and begins to gesticulate like a stripper, and a second later, he removes his shirt. It was so disgusting. Ted Jenkins here. What!? Where did you get it? Yes, even more impressive now, right? Ok, I confess! It all started a few weeks. I do not steal. And I do not wear glasses. Marshall. Why? It's a trap, you're a fan of the Packers? My wife knows I'm here. She has no money, however it has very special skills. Pelican Rapids? My grandfather lives there. Finally he's dead now, but it haunts a bar on a road. First, you can not control the Grand caramel. Secondly, I see it as a big brother, who has breasts. My older brother had also, in short. That night, I spoke to Lily. I should correct, it would have been so simple. But I have not done. So now, whenever I talk about Jenkins, I avoid pronouns. So the manager comes to marketing staff to choose Midwest. So he, he, he, she, him, him, Jenkins, him, her. Ted, think of the stories I've told. Exactly, that's why Lily can know nothing. Hello? What, why? I have a problem, it was my wife. The first time I spoke to you, she thought you were a man, so... Absolutely. It is Jenkins. Wait, you're not jealous at all? Because we love to madness, right? It was not jealous at all. What is this supposed to mean? I am not diminished for Lily. Yes, it is a bit small, and my mother says she has no hips to carry a baby Eriksen. My God, you think I'm weak. No, ok, I'm glad Lily, but Lily is as lucky as me. None of us is low. What? Interesting article in the newspaper. They say that in every relationship there is a weak and strong. It's not that one, it's in another, I've read before. The newspaper reminded me of the old. In short, what do you think? But not for us? Sure. Imagine, you have a g*n to his head, you have to say that one of us is low. Now, the g*n is pointed at me, and our future children, and our future little monkeys. Depends on who wins the game is played for 3 years. So this... Our two children, our 8 grandchildren, 11 great grandchildren our, our plane piloted by Oprah, and it is poised to spits at an art museum that contains all your favorite pictures, and the only way save everything, and answered: Art thou the weak or strong? Everything you need to decide now. How can you say such a thing! She thinks she is strong. That's right, I have to prove that I am not the weak. I will make her jealous. Yes, an ordinary night for the ""Big caramel."" Do you think she was flirting with me? Sure, I have an opening. If Madame Lily is jealous, young Marshall can not move, then by chance, the ""Big caramel""... may move, ok let me try again. Hey Jenkins! So, Lily and I go back to university bar. And you wonder if maybe you would come... You could watch me play skee-ball... do exactly what you did the other night, something like that. It's really up to you, I mean... Baby! That is, it's a name I do not deserve. You're sure it's not a fever? I did not invent it! It happened, this woman kissed me.With language, his tongue was in my mouth. It was silky... and hard as a branch of starfish It happened! Have you... meatballs? It's nothing. It was not me! You were drunk at 8am? Happy to have you helped you remember. It's nothing! No, who am I to say? Lily? I said to Lily. No, no! No, I... Yes! Yes! Do it! And if you got no time for all this, just tell him that it happened and that you're sorry. And if you're really in a hurry did not tell him you're sorry. Just as it happened, what is most important. It really happened. Thus abbreviated it as much as you can. Well, it happened! What will we do? It happened!Terrible, like you said. It happened! Lil '? It's good!"
1342,5,13,robin ,"Lily can know nothing of what? Really?! It's great, I love this stuff. Guys why this kid staring at me? I understand, I think it happens at last. I recognized my show. No, I go on TV. Yes. Really? We're friends. That's how it goes boy, every relationship has a low and high. That's why Lily is not jealous. The strongest is never jealous because where could go lower? The fort, Lily, is the best thing that low, Marshall may have hoped. Yes, it's definitely, you are going to buy a horse. Try your luck. I've realized that you forgot something this morning, so I thought I would bring thee: thy pen. Nothing to Ted, your course was on my way to work. Come on, stand New York. Really, you watch my show? You flatter me see. Other fans here? That night, great show on poisons. (She goes out, then reopens the door) Also, who makes the worst pizza in New York, I will give you information on traffic streets 5 and 9. It's good but um, this was not your first spelling bee, does not it? Oh that's good. But hmm. But um... Ted, I have a great idea. If you want to make one of your classes exciting, I could read it from someone a little more fun, your students can pay attention and learn. Look, just because your class prefers me to you... What? But umm? I'm not But um, I never told But hum. So, your third book is your new novel, but um... Shit! Sorry. But, but just. No hum! Your first book was written more quickly? But umm... I wanted to ask about the novel you're writing right now, but um... And tonight, you had to, but um... For a long time, but um... Ok, um... but thank you for coming but um... If there are students who look, but um, but um, but um... The police officer was unharmed but um... How's you all? I just wanted to tell you go... (She takes a megaphone) To all those watching. Go! Standing New York! BUT HUM!"
1343,5,13,scotty ,"You are Robin Scherbatsky, right? I did not want to fix, it's just that I watch your show all the time. Bluntly. Why do you hang out with Ted? The cow! Robin Scherbatsky is friends with my art teacher. And a second, you're ""Big caramel""? The truth is that we look for the drinking game. You want to come to the bar with us tonight? Yeah, we wanted to do some of Robin Scherbatsky, if you want to come? We should drink professor, is the rule! She said but um."
1344,5,13,student ,"I watch your show all the time. As the show starts early, it is often at the bar. So when she did an interview, one should drink when she says ""But um""."
1345,5,13,ted ,"You're not serious, my students are going to catch me so I do them a lesson. I have not even my slide projector. Looks like you're not income from a lease, a guy called ""Big caramel"" you're passed. And you're ""Big caramel."" Who is Jenkins? Well it feels good to finally meet the famous Jenkins, after all these stories. What?! You want to sleep with Jenkins? But you are... really... I did not know that... It's going to seem crazy, but I thought Jenkins was a guy. I do not know, maybe history: Jenkins pissed out the window of a taxi. Yes. Wait, if you tell me that you flirt with a woman other than yours, I'll pull out and hit you. Look, I understand why you have not told him? You really think she would be jealous too. Yes, it could be a problem. What Marshall is going to buy a horse. That's so cute. But it's Scotty, one of my students, and he looks at me me. Weird that I'm more famous than you. And I have 30 students in my class, which means, go, 30 times your hearing. We're going to buy Scotty a drink for old teacher. Scotty then, a question on neoclassical architecture, and it's good. What? Really? Uh, this is Professor Mosby. This is architecture. Go will study. Go! Of course she was not jealous, it is the dynamics of your relationship. Exactly, low in trying to conquer another out of reach, and the strong will go back down to be with the other person less. So, to end modern architecture is very short, experimented with the houses in V. (Robin enters the classroom Ted) Excuse me one second. What are you doing here? It's your pen, and you have chewed the end, recently. No, it is not. Thank you for last, Robin. Really? You watch his show? It's like watching an aquarium lit, and less interesting. And now that I think, not even informed. The what? But um, it would seem, she often said. It was agreed that you do not speak of those things. Okay, I know. You remember the other night, the game of skee-ball, when you did your good score? Bluntly. Okay, I understand. Remove your hair in the bathtub once you're done? Looks like you want to make a bath mat. Oh, you're entertaining? Last night there were 3 minutes of silence where you tried to patch up your sweater. That's why they watch. They did a drinking game on you.Every time you say ""But um"", they take a shot. Yes. So I guess it's not a great drinking game. This means that last night when we played with Barney, I was not drunk and I did not vomit on it. Except that I did these two things here, take this. And here's a few of his contributions to architecture and now... We remember him for just one thing. My friends this is the sad legacy of Gregorio... Franchetti Gazibo. Questions? What? Well, what can I say except... um But I am! I can always come? I will pay? It's not pretty! No, no, no, do not drink, it's a trap! My God, help us all! So we'll just have a quiet day course. Nobody is talking! No noise! No, no, no, please. Just goes away!"
1346,5,13,woman ,"Hi, guys."
1347,5,13,,"Ted (2030): Children, when you're 30 and live in New York, there are few places where it is better not to be. Time Square at New Year, Christmas at Rockefeller Center, but the worst: a student bar! Ted (2030): We have heard of Jenkins few weeks ago. Ted (2030): And the stories continued. Barney, joining them: And there's going to have another. I'll sleep with Jenkins. Jenkins:... then you're afraid she became insane upon learning that I am a woman. Ted (2030): Marshall cracked. The moment he feared. Ted (2030): Tonight, we saw how much she often said. Ted (2030): It went on for a while, until finally... Ted:... You're a drinking game. All, the student bar: But hum! Ted (2030): And that's when that Robin had an idea that would end the game forever. Ted (2030): Children, your Uncle Marshall was never tried again to make your aunt Lily jealous."
1348,5,14,barney ,"Thank you, Jim. I'm glad to be back on the show. Hold on, Jimbo, it is extraordinary. It all started when I decided to start a small challenge. Whatever the girl I'm trying to point is that I go with her tonight. And... they're off! Jim, there is nothing in my usual way to pack. That brings us to the second night. You see the b*mb that pampers its Black Russian (Vodka and coffee liqueur)? She left to exchange it with a White American. Enter me five! You know... If you're not careful, you'll lose me. I guess that's just what they said when I was gone. Jim, I can tell you that I was gone, so I wanted a little spice. I think I'll take small tits tonight. Lily, it's people too. I had left to do... flawless. It was faultless. 7 nights, 7 girls, 0 rejection. Yeah. The only player in history to have accomplished both Pete was Drexell 'The mustache' in 1896. You and me in the closet of the Spanish supermarket next door. I can even say, without a fault. I'd love to say the same of my friends. Well done, Jim. Hey! Absolutely. A background. It could not get better. I make fun of that? I need you. Which of these girls look the most stupid? Thank you, Skip. No, sir. I like to play by the rules. While I can not say I did not propose to. No thank you. It's 8:00. I've never touched. I can pee in a jar if you like, Jim Nantz. Ted, relax. I am already 6 of 6. Yeah. I ate at the Tavern of vegetables, I started talking to the Swedish Top Model, and the next moment we batifolait in the back of a carriage. Go my beautiful, Hue! I ate at the ""Staten Island Chili's,"" and I jumped a hairdresser completely stuffed. Are you happy, Ulysses? No vain, ok? Between number 5 and I, there was a connection. She will resume her studies, she has a child or who is studying... something with ""studies"". I do not know what to tell you, Lily is always trying to ruin me any. You have the eye to notice such details, Jim Nantz. I wish I had power. Well, thank you to her, the only thing that can prevent a stroke insured was about to walk out the door. A member of the New York Yankees World Champions in 2009. You wanna come to my house and watch the collection of snowballs? But not play well enough. All this week was a waste of time. And tomorrow I'm getting fired. You share a toothbrush? Martini? Wow, to be honest, this is not my habit, but I feel a real connection, Number 7... Christy. I beg you. I did it! I did it! Thank you, Jim. I would never have done it without the help of my friends. Uh, Jim, I told you I wanted to talk about it. What a c**t. I barely slept."
1349,5,14,jen ,Present.
1350,5,14,jim ,"Hi friends, any sport has had its icon, which it excels. Ali was boxing, basketball had Jordan, and the sport of sleeping with bombs snuff chance, my next guest, Mr Barney Stinson.Barney, welcome. It's good to have you. And you know, the statistics, they really speak for themselves. Over 200 women spread over 6 continents, 17 countries, 74 sexual positions, and not a single bead. Impressive. But even with all these successes, there has always been an escape for you. Which brings us back to last week. Tell us about our history. So, the first night was pretty normal. Respect. Which brings us to the second night. I believe it. You are awesome. Now, night 3. Describe it to us. Our toothbrush? Every day? Awesome. I mean, it's the equivalent of sexual perfect game in baseball, in even harder. It was not the first time you were about to accomplish. So you knew that one mistake, and we reach the end. Sometimes a teammate makes a mistake. Sometimes a minefield... So you're at four, he'll just make a 5 to 7. Hey, I try. I'm not you. It was then comes the night No 5, and trouble with. Barney, I will interrupt you one second, I must ask you something. Have you ever taken Viagra? Barney, I trust you. I miss you even ask the question. Let's talk about the night 6. Two girls prepared to perfection. Unbelievable. You know, there are two things that do not.First: you do not open an email from Phil Simms to your children.And second: you do not wear bad luck to a man on track to flawless. I think she cracked a bit for the Barnacle. Do not tell me that she dared to say ""The door-jinx, it does not exist."" You were about to achieve something so beautiful. Unbelievable. Congratulations on your faultless. Hey, on another subject, you really think you could get fired today? Barney, I go straight from your imagination, so apparently we must talk! Think about it. You're the idiot."
1351,5,14,lily ,"How did it go with Dale? Robin, this is not because a guy talks a lot about a fictional character for your first date it can not be your future. How it happened at school today, Ted? We will not make jokes, Ted. I mean, this girl must really be in the hole. Wow, two in a row, Barney is thoroughly. It is everything I love that Marshall either. You're yucky. Thank you. Of course not! It is perfectly normal. It was a great day out at 4 it was cool, we were relaxed, it was not freaked out. Yeah. That's weird? Wow. 3 girls in 3 nights. This is gross, even from Barney. Wear what bad luck? Wait a second. Want it called? We kept her in the bathroom. Oh, it's weird. He said nothing. I'll go talk to him. Come on, it's his career. This is much more important than a stupid without... It must go talk to him. So what did he say? You were supposed to talk about his loss of job. And why ignore it will fix things? Jen Coulin! Barney, we know that you are going you may get fired. Wait, you ought to speak. You turn away from reality, kissing unnecessarily on all sides. God forbid, if you manage to find a job, sell your apartment.Marshall and I, we have a free room. You can stay as long as you want. I talk to my friend who is going through a difficult period. Try to sleep with seven women in seven nights, that's not what I would call ""very well get out."" It is a cry for help. What? Without fault? Flawless, faultless, flawless! Grow up a little! Ok, I have a question. If I ruined everything, why is it that Barney is in the process of hanging the girl three martinis in there? Yeah, you know? Doors-jinx, it does not exist. Ok, let me do it the Canadian So how do you react if one of those guys with skates and sticks came back here? Yeah, sorry. I'm so clumsy! Oh, thank you. I think I twisted my ankle. Do what you can bring me some ice? In commemoration, at the entrance to the Barney legend, this tie, worn during his seventh night of her flawless, freshly removed."
1352,5,14,male ,"As in, a toothbrush?"
1353,5,14,marshall ,"Oh my God. Wow. Hi! The Yeti is not fictitious. How do you know he'll call? You really soiled the name of Jen Coulin. It's all I want to be. thank you. There is no such Bizarros who share everything. You know, Lily and I was looking for a new couple of friends since we lost Robin and Barney, and Ted and Stella and Ted and Robin, and Ted... Ted and Victoria, when do you arrive to keep one? And there, a tiny detail has surfaced, and it ruined the whole evening. It's crazy that last week, it happened the same with our toothbrushes. Do not tell! You're going to jinx him! Excuse me, Jen? Yeah. It's been years! You had to know, you lived with us. Oh my god! Hi. How is Barney? Yeah? Hard to believe. Apparently, this big merger last week went wrong, and Barney wears the hat. Even I who works with him, I just learned this afternoon when I walked past the office of his boss. I never thought about Barney so scared. I think he'll get fired. Yeah, they have a meeting Friday to see if he keeps his job or not. Ahh! Okay. You can lick my hand all you want, I will not let you ruin... Ouch! Guys, guys, look! It was pretty awesome. You should try it. I still have a few. You sure? Ok, do as you like. What time is it? 8:00? I have to go to hospital. Hey! Oh, my God, you've really pushed to the limit. What do you care? You said it was a big con. He's doing very well. He has no chance. There's going to happen! Lily, I'll buy my own toothbrush. This is Nick Swisher. It is part of the New York Yankees. No regular guy from New York can not compete with a Yankee. I was there. Damn, this guy could play. It's happening, look. A collection of snow globes? I'm sorry. But for what it's worth, this week was not a waste of time. We all had a horrible week, and you have helped us change a little air. We frightened a couple great just because we share a toothbrush. Wait a minute! Aldrin was seen. She tries to escape, she jumps, and... I thought she would not do that. She did! I believe that there is no jinx finally. Damn. Swisher is back in play Swisher is back in play! I'm sorry. Lily, Nick Swisher think it's cute. That's the guy, the official caps of no fault of Barney. I was going to make t-shirts, but you know, sizes, all that, and it would hurt me to think. May the heroic story of Barney to be remembered, and transmitted from generation to generation."
1354,5,14,mr donovan," Stinson, we made a decision. We keep you. I know this last week has been hard."
1355,5,14,nick ,"And? Actually, I think it's cute. Are we not try to find someone who could share his toothbrush? Yeah, baseball is great, but I tell you, this is not hockey."
1356,5,14,overall ,Nice try.
1357,5,14,robin ,"Hi! You know, sometimes, the guy with thick glasses and a t-shirt of the Smurfs, it's just a cliche. And sometimes it is a moron with a squint and a platonic relationship with Gargamel. Guys, when Dale called for a second hot date, what do I tell her? How cute, Marshall. But I think mom knows when she was a hit. I mean, he could not help but look at me. You asked him if she had reached the right exit? This is a lucky girl, Barney was my best shot. Of course I do. What's happening guys? As in, a toothbrush? You use both? Hey, look, Barney has yet fallen one. Yeah, Ted, we know tons of people who call Jen. Oh, you're there. The dreaded call from Dale. Oh, that's my mother. She has big health problems. But why does he not call? No! Shut up! You have not a kind of toothbrush to share or something like that? Wait. Are you saying that for 8 years, you have shared a toothbrush every 3? I'm having so much! Poor guy. It must pinball. Jen Coulin. Why do you... It scales all his education in the toilet. It's only been five days, he will call! Tell Dale not like that, ok? It is twice as good as you never will! Forget not you bring your toothbrush. What? Why? Because the guy with the weird cut went back? I'm still not. Lily, if one of the Vancouver Canucks came here, I fall on my ass so that there would be a hole halfway to China in the soil. Oh, Barney's done. I met my soul mate, and he never called back. Well, not yet. He will. He will. Well, they and Ted. Oh, shit. That's great, I'm all baseball. Mookie Wilson, while a player eh? I live just above."

And sometimes, without even trying, you can tear someone's heart, and crush it in front of a roomful of 26 people and a teacher's assistant. Something bad happened. This was the first course of the semester... Jamie Adamic. Salvation. Brian Glow-atz. Glau-atz?Salvation. Well done. Add a false name on the call sheet, very original guys. You know, I expected a little maturity, coming from students like you, and frankly, more creative. I mean, seriously, what kind of fake name is Jen Coulin? Come on guys, you would have at least been able to make it sound right. Jen Coulin? What happened to classic? Sat Troulcu, Ted and Bill Oukoi, Maby Stoukette, Roland Cule, that's false names, but Jen Coulin? Jen Coulin! Come on, I wait, swing all your jokes about Jen Coulin. Have you finished? And this is the best friend I ever had. You share it? Your share forever. That's exactly what you are. How we came up with that? Our toothbrush? Marshall, 4 of 5 dentists have just vomited on. Yuck? Are you kidding? There is no one left to do... Jen has not come into being today. Jen Coulin. Yeah. When did you start doing that too? Yeah, but you always keep your toothbrush in the bathroom, which is, incidentally, also weird. No, there was a toothbrush in the bathroom, and it was mine. Finish me! Beer! Salvation. Like a charm. As all week. Why? I can not believe that Barney is going to get fired. No! You can not distract a man who is right... you know what. I'm going. He needs a brother. Hey buddy. Is everything okay? Anything you want. What's the matter? Let's see it. Already heated to perfection? The smashed out? Ok I will deal for Big Mac. What? Oh, it will try with the girl holding the burger there. Lily, why is that force him to face a problem that can not adjust will help? You're much ignored the problems of dental hygiene for a dozen years. And yet you seem to... Dale you called? Hey, what are you doing here? Returns to the bar! Really? Great. What really happened? Now my students have taught me that Jen Coulin abandon my material. News from Dale? Lily, what are you doing? His whole life is a call for help. But we do not mess with a man who is in the midst of a no... I can not believe that thou hast brought him bad luck. Oh, my God! Well, that's it. Barney's still got to 6. And this is true for a former Yankee. When I arrived here, I was the fourth date with a girl I loved a lot before I do the fly by Phil Rizzuto. It's the same thing for the Yankees. He is pinball. It was well played, well played, well played. Yeah, I got my first drop. Wait a minute. When we went out together, you borrow the toothbrush all the time. At the second she sits next to Swisher, we reach the end. Follow me. Hey, Nick Swisher! This guy and his wife share a toothbrush! And it's weird, right? You take a beer with a Yankee, if that's not cool! I already see myself in front of my children, trying to tell them when their uncle Barney kissed 7 chicks in a row. You send Wendy to say now? Go! It's good, I understood.Jen Coulin is a crap name, and it becomes increasingly shitty when it is repeated. Jen Coulin. Jen Coulin. Jen Coulin."

Others tap their feet.And others imagine themselves to be interviewed by renowned sports commentator Jim Nantz. Ted, from seeing Barney: That was fast. Man:... and the toothbrush Joanna is ejected from the sink, facing the ceiling, and falls straight down the toilet. Jim:... takes you straight into the wall. And sometimes you spread yourself. And it almost always ends badly. But this week, you were to 3 of 3, and no sign of abating. Pattern:... what it has cost this company, Stinson?! Ted:... seriously guys. Barney:... Huh? Ted (2030): And that's when Aunt Lily has seen what is great about sport, they make you forget about your problems, but only for a little while. And deep within us, we all needed this flawlessly.

OK I've enlisted Ranjit's services as my personal driver because for the next week I'll be sleeping with hundreds of women and I don't want to take the subway cause... you know... germs! Oh, indubitably! I'm meeting the first one here any minute. Keep your eyes pealed for a red sweater. Based on her texts, she's dirty, dyslexic and want to 96 me, semi-colon and parenthesis.

Does she text her mother with those fingers? Now look at this one... or this one, or this one, or this one, or... I can't do that, Ted. I just can't hook up with a girl if there is a hotter girl out there with whom up can be hooked. I know, isn't it wonderful? (answers phone) Go for Barney. Cut to the chase, what's your cup size?...Oh, hi Mom! (walks by, phone ringing)Or this one, or this one, or this one... There is no place I would rather be and no one I would rather be with...

Cursed, I tell you! I tried to ignore it but it just never stops ringing. It's ruining my life! I should get that.

And one lucky patient will be receiving a very special chocolate heart: a human heart. OK, that reminds me, I've been meaning to ask you... Robin, do you have any Valentine's Day plans? I'm having some friends over at my place for a party. You should come by if you want. Hello, Robin. (he gets up from the couch, he's naked, except for a heart-shaped red chocolate box covering his privates) I don't know. It's something called the Naked Man. I read about it on some guy's blog. My god, I'm so stupid, why did I ever think it would work on someone like you? I only said that to get you to come over here. I didn't think you'd bring a date. Oh god, you probably think I'm some kind of playboy now, right? Robin, I have to apologize... No. Listen... after you left the other night, I was embarrassed. Not because I was naked. I'm actually pretty OK with my body. I got married in college. I just got divorced three months ago. I have no idea how to be single. But that's not why I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed by my behavior right here at Channel...hmm, it starts with a 1, I know that, but... 12!... Right. Well, no, you look at this mug (point to his face). You are a tremendous news anchor. And you deserve a co-anchor who gives a crap. And from here on out, it's gonna be me. Well, you'll see it right now. I'll go get you some coffee. Well, look at that!"

Robin, Don didn't ask you out. Oh well with the slight assist from the Wesleyan housing department. Definitely. Ducks are better than rabbits. YAY. Pants. Ted? No, he's not seeing anyone. Remember, he asked us to find...  I don't know what kind of architect? Houses, buildings, that kind of crap. You can be choosey? You're in a bar on Valentine's Day, uh! Man, Ted's right, it's tough out there. Married. Committed. Bellevue. Ted's her least favorite person in the world. Yeah, yeah, tell him, tell him!  She needs to get married. It's hidden.  Oops."
1369,5,15,marshall ,"You were there. It was the... Good to see you. How's it going? What did you say? Robin, you're gonna marry this man so freaking hard, right in the butt. What would your viewers think? It is true. It's very rare that two people just meet and fall madly in love... like Robin and Don. Well, dog my cats! I think I know what's going on here. Robin... did you WANT Don to ask out? You want us to arrange your marriage? You're waiting for me to comment on your self-assigned nickname? Well, here's my comment. I love it. Teddy Westside? Continue. And a healthy splash of Drakkar Noir. (they hive five) (Robin giggles) I love that blazer. Almost as much as Robin loves Don. Robin, neurologically speaking, the part of the human brain that makes you hate people is located right next to the part of the brain that makes you want to jump people's bones. The two responses are so similar, it's hard to tell them apart. Relationships are like that. I mean, look, when you first met Don, you hated him, you thought ""This guy's a duck"", but one of these days you're gonna realize ""This is actually someone that I love, he's a rabbit"". What?!! I got... ducks are... ducks are... rabbits are adorable. Ducks are aargh. Have you ever been in a fight with a duck? I mean, ducks are... jerks.  We're not talking about flavour, Ted. Who carries a duck's foot for good luck? Anyone? Because it's illegal, Ted! FINE! I CAN SEE IT! YOU WIN! Duck's good... (long pause, then whispers...) rabbit's bad. I'll allow it. Aren't we supposed to go on a double date with Ted? Oh, no. Hey! Hey, wanna get married? (to the 1st one) Wanna marry my friend Ted? (to the 2nd one) Wanna marry my friend Ted? (to the 3d one) Wanna marry my friend Ted? Hey, just real quick... (the girl pepper-sprays him, he writhes in pain) you wanna marry my friend Ted? This is stupid. You know what, we forgot about this. I'm sure Ted did also. Oh, thank god, you're here! No. Ted. We got her. It's, it's the craziest thing. We were searching all week and then a couple hours ago... Trudy? Blah Blah? Relationship? Natalie? Well, she's not getting any younger. We have to find Ted a wife. We're being too choosey. It almost doesn't matter who it is at this point. (both look over at Barney's phone) I know, I know... but no, then we met her and Ted... she's a world-class violinist, she's a gourmet cook and she can quote every line from Caddy Shack. Oh but Natalia, tell Ted the problem.  Federal law expressly dictates that a foreign national can't maintain residency for longer than six months without a work visa. Why would Ted order the rabbit if he's just gonna run out? Oh, thank god, you're here. Lily. (hands her the phone). No. No! (Barney grabs his neck) Aaaargh."

Well we were on the air, I was on the spot, so I said OK. What? Nooo I HATE Don. And now I can't cancel because I said I would go out with him on the air. Getting drunk and cleaning the apartment was a plan? Oh but we're not even like going out for dinner, we're just hanging out at his place. No, it's not like that. It's just us and a bunch of other people. Errrrrrr...I... OK. Err, of course he asked me out. Yes, he did. He did. He did. He DID! Whaaat?!! (in a high voice) (huffs) Nooo, I HATE Don! I-I-I can't stop thinking how much I hate him, it's like, it's like... all the time. I just wanna attack him and rip his stupid clothes off and spank him with his little paddle until his bum's all red. SHUT UP!! (leaves the table) I do not love Don. Yeah I got to agree. Duck's up, rabbit down. You wrap yourself in a comforter stuffed with rabbit hair. (almost yells) I wrap myself in one stuffed with duck feathers. Who's cosier? No, no, no, no, no, no... who's cosier? Say it. YAYYYYY. Thank you. And Don is, and always will be, a rabbit. Hey, Ted? Before you go meet your future wife, why don't you swing by Don's party with me? Yeah, why? They're not gonna get... Ha ha ha. It's not gonna get happen... but yeah, do that! Come... god, Don, what the hell are you doing? Yeah, cause I would never, could like, standards, so... you know... I thought this was a party. Ted's not my date. He's a friend. (sees Don with imaginary rabbit's ears) You could say that. Ted, this may hurt a little, I'm recycling your old Architecture Weekly magazines. Cleaning. You go on your date. Happy Valentine's Day. You go on your date. Happy Valentine's Day. Ted! Come on. Big date. I know. So much running around and freaking out. For what? Well, the joke's on the rest of the world cause we can do that on our own. Exactly. Save it. Let's just do the news. Clearly. 12. You can... just look at your mug. Well, I'll believe that when I see it. Don!! You're wearing pants! (sees him with an imaginary duck's beak) Uh, duck!"
1374,5,15,ted ,"Well, that explains where Barney is. Hey! Hey, Ranjit! Wait, you're... you're actually gonna hook up with these girls that call you? This ought to be good. I can only imagine the quality of girls... That beer looks a little flat. Something troubling you, kiddo? That's crazy! And they use ""Ulee"" because of the vowels. Wow wow wow, you said you'd go out with him on Valentine's? I thought we had plans! I did NOT...say... it was a good plan. OK OK OK buddy, how about you do this? Go nail that girl, then read your texts. So there's a hotter girl. Isn't that the problem in a nutshell? There's too many options. You got internet dating, you got bars... Hm. Err no he didn't. See! That right there is what free will gets you. Constant ego-shattering uncertainty. I'm done with that. I want what Ranjit has. I've spent my entire adult life looking for the perfect woman and I'm spending Valentine's Day scrubbing the toilet. I need someone else to find me that woman. Marshall, Lily, arrange-marriage me! Absolutely. Looks there's two sides to dating, right? Picking and getting picked. Getting picked, I'm good at. Ladies looove Teddy Westside. Really?! (excited) It's the picking, I suck at. I pick the wrong girls. But you guys, you're the best pickers I know. You picked each other. Get out there and find me a girl. We'll double date on Valentine's Day. If I like her, I will marry her... if she's cool with it. And she will be. Cause I'll wear my nice blazer. You know what it's like? Wait, I have to get a book. Give me 30 seconds. OK this is fun. Look at this picture. It's a rabbit! You can look at it for hours and be absolutely sure it's a rabbit. But then one day, you look at it and you realize, ""wait a second, it's a duck!"" Rabbit, duck, rabbit, duck. Isn't it fun? Wow I think you got it backwards there, buddy. The duck is the thing you love, the rabbit is the thing you hate. Duck is delicious. Rabbit is all gamey.  Flavour counts. Hold on, I've got to get another book. Then why don't we take, a rabbit, a duck, stick 'em in a cardboard box and let them fight it out? Only if we bet on it, Marshall! You have to say it. YESSS. Oh I wouldn't be so sure about that, Robin. Think about it. Don... Donald. Donald... Duck. (Marshall sighs heavily) And what, I wonder, does Donald Duck never wear? Pants. Don's... a duck. (Lily and Marshall sigh in awe of Ted) Permission to say ""lawyered""? Lawyered. Here comes the groom in his favorite blazer, gonna meet my wife and I'm...laser, tazer, gaze her, take, bathe her? Yeah? That's what you're wearing? He's a duck. That dude be straight-ducking. ""And I think that I'll amaze her"". Nailed it! Look, Robin, I don't wanna crowd you on your little date here, so if things start to get hot and heavy with Don... I'm just saying, if they do... I'll just say ""Well, I got a dinner res"" and then, wait this is the last part, I've been working on it for a while... I'll duck out. Well, I got a dinner res... (Ted ducks out) So he's a rabbit. At least you know for sure. What are you doing? Yeah, I've been thinking, hmm, maybe we should call this whole thing off... It's a phone girl!? Wow. What? Rabbit. Sorry, guys, I gotta go. (he leaves) Barney's phone... I wonder how it got in there? Uh what's the harm... Hello! Terrific. I will see you there. And I'll be the guy in the awesome blazer. Ah ah ah I think you'll know the blazer when you see it. Oooh! I gotta go. Rabbit. Sorry, guys, I gotta go. Well, heeellooooo. (to a pretty girl ; phone rings) Sorry, babe, I gotta take this. Barney's phone, Teddy Westside speaking. No, no, I love it so much. It just keeps ringing and ringing and ringing. Give it, give it. It's mine now. Being single sucks.

Something interesting or beautiful that can claim to admire for 5 minutes before it starts on the track. It's tricky. It must be interesting enough that the girl up, but not too much not to spoil the evening. The slot machine is too much fun. And a trampoline... that's actually too dangerous. But I finally found the perfect bait... A mini pig. Yes, you can borrow. Yes, completely. It's like that. ""I can not be with you"". ""For now."" Really? You really gonna sit and watch the door all night because Tiffany said she would try to pass? Ted, let me be clear. That girl is poison and you have to forget your life forever. Hold on to it. Never lets go! I have never seen more beautiful girls. They all work with Tiffany? There can be only one explanation for that. Tiffany is a representative... e, pharmaceuticals? And you never thought to say? That a b... Since time immemorial there has always been a professional edge to which girls g*ns, like Tiffany, have flocked. I'll redo the story? It began 2.5 million years ago. The man was a hunter.So the profession's sexiest moment? Picker. h*m* erectus, indeed. With improved technology, the profession's sexiest moment was changing. I'm sure it's a hernia. You can double-check? And then the man grabbed the heavens. So girls sexy stiletto heels began and became a flight attendant. I'm right and ready to fire. Then the man said, ""Life is hard. I should start taking lots of drugs. "" So sexy girls landed in medical offices, hot enough to make these pills erection ironically unnecessary. So today, girls are pharma's sexiest moment. Largue Tiffany and join the Barnacle in a buffet of girls pharma. There may be loss of clothing, knees burned, respiratory weakness and sore abs the next day. That the world give a damn five?! There's no nights like with pharma pharma because the nights never stop! Dude, I've flirted with three of them. The fantasy. In addition, my cholesterol is low. My restless legs syndrome is cured. I am more alive than ever. Yesterday I was with this girl so sexy that pharma should call a doctor if you have no erection for more than 4h. I have no reason people? It's over. The girls of pharma are more than gunnery. This is the end of an era. Really? It starts with a Gladys. And suddenly, a few gay guys not so fabulous fall into the ranks. And before you know it, the girls look like pharma team to a Southwest flight to Albuquerque in Little Rock. It's over! I've realized that their reign had to stop to give way to a sexy new profession. It may be... communications officer in an intergalactic spaceship to a distant solar system that we can imagine. Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits.

You're right. Tomorrow, that's what I'll do. I can not spoil the Tijuana Tuesday. Mini Pig, it is impossible that I may one day with you. For now. I'm sorry, but it is just so cute. I just want to cuddle him all day. Oh, yes. I still do. And tell me, would you have accidentally made this chocolate cake? There's no shame to admit it. We were all hooked and we all hooked someone. Mini pig... I do not wanna be with you. For now. Mini pig... I do not wanna be with you. Ever. It will never be together in any sexual way again. Really bad. I can do it alone. Listen, Scooter.

And then I saw them. The footprints of Lisa. She had passed right by me to the house. It was fine in the end. It freed me from its hook. ""For now"" you draw a picture of a future where everything will be magical, but in truth, it'll never happen. A little? Completely. The poor showed up at our wedding hope you recover. Wait. What? We certainly do not talk about that! I thought you was talking about a long-awaited means of transport, carrying such poor canteen. You're mounted on it? You did a tour? Really? In your place I would have rode this scooter all day to break it into two. So these poor women must still walk? Expect. Scooter works in your school? I feel bad for Scooter. It took this job just because he thinks he has a chance with you. You must ensure that he understands that it is wrong for it turns the page and gets a real work canteen. Shit! ""For now""? You got to the earnest Scooter? You must release your scooter hook. Why not tomorrow? I know you're having trouble dropping Scooter. I decided that you need training. And you say that the problem is his sad eyes? (He returns with a mini pig) Okay, shut up, woman. Now I want you to look this mini pig and you tell him it is impossible for you to be with him one day. Go! Be a man! You know, it's funny. I remember when you told me stuff like that. Not as much. Not as much. Come on, Lily. You must drop Scooter. Try it again. Act like a man! Finish him! Well done.

It was on both sides. I was hooked and crocheter. It's good guys. I was shameless, but I did not have money problems. ""Right now"" is the catch phrase of choice. You're always on the hook. And let me guess: it's not gone further than that. Are you kidding? And this daughter of the university library? Henrietta? It is too much to your hook. You like to have Henrietta close for the same reason that Tiffany likes to have you close, it flatters the ego. Mike and I are just friends. Yeah, right. If you mean to do my laundry, I'm starting lineup. What! I do not keep Mike in my hook. Dude, I'm a girl. Our female parts are like a cobweb.Sometimes you jokes of things you want to. And Henrietta, in any way, are not losing time with you, huh? There is no one. Just the girl with whom you came out recently. What? You're a little dramatic. What did you do? Sorry, big guy. Honesty is hard, but ultimately it is the softer alternative. (Mike enters with the laundry basket) I must tell you something. You've finished the laundry fragile? It can wait. How are you? Why change your mind?"

On which it would work? I can borrow your mini pig? You've always been so beautiful? You're going out on ""In high school I was super shy and I in my skin""? Seriously? You got a boyfriend? Okay. He is or not? Do you understand anything? Someone does not want to lose his Dark Brown. What? I am not to his hook. That's not the same with me and Tiffany. Listen. I will not give up. This girl is special. It will get better with Tiffany. There she is. (Between Tiffany followed by several other women) It has led to colleagues. Yep. How do you know? What? It's just a job. I will not say explicitly. Okay. In fact, you've dumped your loser of guy? She touched my nose. Friends, good news. Tiffany broke up with her boyfriend. So I'm not the hook. Look what we did yesterday. First, it was spoiled. Then we shared a chocolate cake.Then, well, I did not used to join the discussions of changing rooms, but I made her a foot massage... rather sensual. Well, no, but... It was a pre-made. I've never done that. Henrietta and I are just friends. Absolutely not. You amaze me that such an expert is to keep people on your hook. And this poor cameraman your job? Come on. You're Captain Hook. That's not why it's good. Henrietta knows we're just friends. In fact, I'll call and get away with it tonight, friends. No, that's fine. Hello? Hey Tiffany! I would love that. What are you doing here? Great. See you in 10 minutes. Super. Sorry, Henrietta, something unexpected.We redo it, my friend? It works, yeah. Champagne? Whatever it is, we can talk now. Now that I think a call would have been nice. You know what? That will not work between us... ever. I'm done. (He takes the jacket on the bed and hand) And that's really better for traffic if you weight the arch with your thumbs. Now I'm done. I'm done. It's worse. Yeah, there was a... Honestly, I thought to marry him just out of sheer embarrassment. But I did the right thing. I did what anyone who has someone should hook her. I would have broken my heart. Henrietta, I'm sorry if it's brutal but I think you duty. I do not wanna be with you. Ever. It was violent. You still broies black to the end of the era of the daughters of pharma?"
1390,5,16,tiffany ,"You have a mini pig? I can not believe it! You're too cute!You're the cutest little pig on Earth! What? I was shy and ill at ease. I'd like 50 more pounds and protruding teeth. No. I was always canon. What can I do? You know who else would love this mini pig? (He goes to kiss) My boyfriend. I know... Boring, eh? Finally, it is... not really my boyfriend. Well, technically it is. A little each but not both. I appreciate you. But you must be patient. I do not want to lose you, my Dark Brown. You interest me very much. But I can not be with you for now. Hi my great darkness. How are you? No, sir. Hey Ted! I go to the country this weekend at a friends wedding.Wanna be my cavalier? I forgot to call you. This is Jack. This is the man at the wedding. We just get back together. It is not great? And it is in a group. Thank you. Well, I do not think it will work out between us. For now. You've missed so much, baby. This is Jack.

1393,5,16,,"Ted (2030): The children in my stories, I'm a romantic idealist in search of true love. In it, I'm just stupid. Ted (2030): I should have quit. Ted (2030): It was the devil! Ted (2030): No, moron! Ted (2030): Yes, completely. Finally... Ted (2030):... it was spoiled. We shared a chocolate cake. It made me long foot massages. I'm not proud of, children. Ted (2030): Children, looking back, I do not know how I have not seen Henrietta was crazy about me. Ted (2030): What a jerk. Ted (2030): So there I was, at one of the surest signs to make a landing in a relationship: a country wedding. It finally came. Ted (2030): And that's when it hit me. I was at his hook. I also realized... Ted (2030): Tiffany was to hook this guy. It was a vicious circle.Henrietta was my hook. And years later I learned that this poor guy was on the hook of Henrietta. Ted (2030): So that night I went to live in Henrietta prepared to release it from my hook."
1394,5,17,anita ,"I would summarize in one, Robin. And that word is ""no.""By saying no constantly and consistently, it gives a power, simultaneously transforming any fool in human wreck, subject, and whining. No. And you, Robin? You go out with someone? You were broken heart? That Barney needs a lesson. Give me the order, and I will destroy it. I will use the power of ""no"" to destroy your friend Barney.Say it. Thank you, Mike. Think about it. It's done. (Mike brings a drink to Anita) Thank you, Mike. I violate any rules in my coming here, but... no one asks me rabbit like that, so we go out or not? I see. You try the trick of ""no."" You really think it'll work?Because it will not work. Okay, I'll make a deal. Maybe... you might get lucky after the 12th hot date. The 11th? The fifth? Tonight? This evening before dinner? Go. Well. Because my answer is no, too. This is my last offer."
1395,5,17,barney ,"It all started a week ago. I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady. Aside from a woman who appreciates a nice tie. It was not my best tie. So, right after that, I took her home. Fortunately, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow. What? Wait, what? I thought your body would become a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger only to satisfy my every carnal desires. I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners. Continuous. Continues. Kashmir? This is the virgin merino hand-woven. The fibers of this costume are spaced less than 12 microns. Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle. She did it too! You try this shit of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail. Did you just say you got a kid! Completely. Of course. Well... Just tell me how! Excuse me, someone is using this stool? I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted... I can have two shots ahead. There is a flaw in there and I will get it. I can not believe. Friends... This is it! She wrote the book! It must be named Anita. My plan was to sleep with her but it changes everything. New plan: I'll sleep with her. This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger. (Robin phone) I put on the StairMaster and... Spoilers. Regardless, we did. Shit. I read this entire book and I find no fault. What will I do? Tell me. A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date? Okay. You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic? What are you doing? They look at us. Really? You really gonna do that? It looks to me like cutesy and romantic. Box strip? Why did you do that? Why are you angry against me? The period of mourning? She has not had a period of mourning. What, she is upset? You should have seen. We go back home... I can not believe that Robin is upset. I did worse after the premiere of ""The Phantom Menace.""It's been like that since we broke up? I know where. I know you're upset. You sure you're not upset? You're not another number for me. I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven? Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want. I promise. It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go. I wanted to call you. I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no. No. No. No. No. No. I'm sorry. The answer is no. Here is my story. I hope so too."

1397,5,17,female ,12 microns. I like the tight fibers. 17.
1398,5,17,lily ,"It's been 4 months since you broke up with Barney. It's time to get back on the market. If you're not going to take her 17th hot date, you should give up. That girl that Barney hunting, it seems a somewhat anti-Barney. I like the way the universe has decided to collect. You told to go and see Anita Barney? How you know her? I hope this was not the same nights. You know her. She keeps her emotions for her. But yes, I saw her crying sometimes. I know, but the song is rather catchy. A problem? Barney, sit down, there are two three things to tell you. Of course she is upset. Look at you, poor trail. Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where."
1399,5,17,marshall ,"Nice to meet you. This guy is awesome. It's funny, smart, beautiful. You have him to nab it before someone else. Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier. It invites you to come out? Say yes! Say yes! I just have a cold. That's why for my voice. (She goes into the kitchen and tries to pick up the phone) But great for Saturday night. One can go to a restaurant grill, and you could bring a first side for my friends Marshall. I gotta go. Kisses. You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you. You knew that Robin was in mourning? It looked good after the break. She cried? Real tears? It means... Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier. You see, this guy has been very active. Sexually. Finally, it is like that... bang... bang... bang... You see? It's like... bang... bang... How could you let me do? You're my wife. You must avoid that I ridiculed in public. Tonight is the big night. Where do you take D-Bag?This is a bad nickname for Don. I will look better. How does it... Wait. Robin canceled his hot date. Ted! How could you do that?! Robin has just released his period of mourning! You see nothing. Typical of a guy. She was obviously devastated. A song about the number of girls that Barney has typed recently. Super. I think it is the toilet. Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire. Typical of a guy. And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet. How was this date?"
1400,5,17,mike ,"It's good. You want a coffee? You? I knew not what you wanted when I caught you a cappuccino, espresso, latte, decaf... and a Turkish coffee."
1401,5,17,police ,"Okay, big guy, tell me all along. Right. This is a $ 500 fine for having jumped into the river. I hope it was worth it."
1402,5,17,robin ,"I really think Don and I found our rhythm to work. The answer might surprise you. It's all rodents. I hope you do not talk to you. Saturday night? Don... Listen, it's... it's really nice of you, and you're really great... But what are you doing? Actually, Anita Barney went to see him because I have requested. It was my show. But, uh... if you had to summarize your book in less than 30 words... Is not this the dream of all women? After the break, we'll talk about your new book, Of course you have not yet retirement plan, look at you, poor trail, scheduled for June We come back after the break. Absolutely, Mike, great idea. I have not really want right now. And then I told him everything. It came out at once. And in the end, she said... That's to say? Come on, it does not really work, though? I never thought that I would think, but... I thought about it. It does. I know it was stupid, but, see, at that time, I was still depressed over the break. I was in my phase of mourning. It means a lot of tape and long nights at the sh**ting range. Serious, Lily. I do not remember everything. I just... I canceled. Thank you. You know what? Looks good. Do not tell Marshall. I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm going. Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date. What? No. I've never been happier. Anita and this seems great. I'm so glad... by the merest chance, you found yourself. It warms my f*cking heart. Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you? And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks. Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you. Do not sleep with Anita. Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not? Good enough. Pretty... pretty good. Come on, guys. It was good. It was nice. We spent a pleasant evening. Let... Let him that. Even if..."
1403,5,17,ted ,"It looks like she has read this book, Of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail. What? It was this book that helps girls find a husband. It is that of Robin. I just laminated. Okay! Barney, when you were with this girl, she subtly used the word ""s*x""? Did she used an excuse for physical contact? And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, ""I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week? "" That is: no s*x before hot date 17th. From Robin is Robin. There is another option... but you're not ready. If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date. If you want my help, it's a super hot date. Let me do it. I will plan everything. Cutesy and romantic? (He starts singing) No need to take him to Paris or Peru... How important it is for you... Box strip. What? She was super excited there is one hour. You look like the classiest and most expensive of all prostitutes. You're excited to go out with Don? I will say nothing. I bet you will spend a good evening. And not, however, a great night. A great night will be spent by Barney during his date with Anita. A carriage ride, dinner at ""Tombeur panties."" They call it a super hot date. She seemed happy after the break. Wait, but that would mean... You sing what? I'll sing a verse. Where is she? You were a real assh*le to Robin when she was in her period of mourning. You see nothing. Yeah. This is an old story of married women. How so?"

When I'm in bed with a man, my body becomes a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger to satisfy every single... the carnal desires of my lover. Good night. I'm in the inter-gender-ing, and I have some sex-seconds before the light turns green. And then, everyone honks, and it really s*x, but I can not run because a jogger slips and falls in the Sacraments of sex-horse. It's the cashmere? It's not crap. Sure you're alone, look at you, poor trail, is a brilliant book. And it scares the guys who only want the ass. You'd be surprised how many assholes we cross. That is why my book says to never sleep at first date. Or the second. Or the third. Or the fourth."

Ted, still singing: In your super hot date, Global problems will simply be put aside, for wonders and surprises that will be the stars. Hurry, do not be late because together, you will find a country where paradise is rebukes. And then, boom! Fireworks in the sky over Manhattan! You kiss him. And your super hot date. Ted (2030): Finally, the night of the great rencards arrived. Ted (2030): And I understood what I had been con with Robin. Ted (2030): Then Aunt Lily told Barney all the little details of what he had not seen since the break. Ted (2030): Your uncle Barney gave Robin finally the super hot date she deserved.

He has how many hands? Yes, at this point, I have never an old head on the photos. Neither ever or always. Nope, not at all. Not the Barnacle. I always look awesome mortally. Not like Marshall, who seems to be ingeniously death. You really put a knot! Of course. You sure? It's physically impossible for me to take a picture ugly. I know why. Ask God. You sure? The camera loves me. Much more than that. The device I want. The unit wants to put on underwear, put an Al Green CD, dim the lights and do all the work while I was still lying with closed eyes.

I want the perfect group shot. Marshall put yourself between Robin and Barney. You know... Light, color, balance, aperture... Of course. You will not last! The photo is forever. Okay, I am perhaps a little bossy, but I want to remember it all. Like tonight. I imagine no better birthday being with my 4 best friends only. (A knock at the door) And Ted's here. And Amanda... I'm really happy you make me my cake. Pretty. Come here. I would say Amanda. Tell me if you need help. (Amanda from the kitchen) Quick, group photo! All front of the fireplace. No problem, it is occupied. The bother, come on. Well, you know, auto focus, speed of obstruction, zoom... Of course not. I let another of your bitches spoil my memories. Ted, you always do that. You bring a girl knows that not all our evenings with us. Really? So, let us walk bitch Street Shuffle. Christmas morning, there was 4. Our first Christmas together, just us five. Here's another nice little game. It's called, Appoints This Bitch. False. You think the Santa Claus, because it was Christmas. Almost. This is Leilani.

The funeral of Uncle Cecil Robin, Marshall, Lily, Robin, Barney, Ted and... ""It proves that you selected the eyes closed"" Isabelle. My appendicitis, Robin, Marshall, Barney, Lily, Ted, and it... you've admitted, you just wanted to make. Compliance. Group Photo! Oh? So do I. These girls have ruined so many things, or you forget Paris. In the first year of college, I studied in Paris, and I had not seen Marshall since 2 months. And Marshall came to me to spring break. And at the last minute, Ted decided to go with the girl he had just to get back, Karen. But just before takeoff... And so began the longest 7:30 of Marshall's life. When I went to look for... It will not surprise you, but the rest of the trip was horrible. I did a picture of a romantic kiss in front of the Eiffel Tower, I actually had. It was just between Karen and Francis, our server yesterday. Emily. Isabelle. Leilani! What's your problem? Here is another. More random bitch to my birthday! Hey, baby! The drawer under the oven. I can not wait. You're the best! You should listen to Robin. Right. Absolutely. Yes, okay, Ted. This bitch has proved some nice, but except for bitches, not the rule of bitches. Yes. We are a family. So why these parties can not they be us? Like the time we celebrated the success of Marshall to the bar. It's as if you had done. Let us raise our glasses. During the last 3 years, Marshall has worked so hard, and I am so proud of you. ""Happy 42nd Birthday, Lori."" No, Marshall, it does not matter. This is not true! Yeah, but you were beautiful. It's true. Look at that one. This is the first picture of us three. Hi, Marshall. Ready for the film? Really? I had totally forgotten that. Marshall and I were together for only a few weeks and you invited me in the photo. We must bring back Amanda. You believed in me. It's my turn to believe in you. As far as I know, this is good.

We five, dinner well dressed, and Ted brings your cognac cheesecake Pumpkin at Edgar. I'll go shopping super secret birthday. And I took him because I do not like the way he looks at you. Small bonus, I took pictures of me naked before packing. With a node. On the other device. Ted, you had to bring a cheesecake, but you've brought two shopping bags and a girl who knows not. My name is Marshall. Welcome. Ted talks. In honor of the 32nd anniversary of Lily, I expected a lot of great games, beginning with... ""Lil-ial Pursuit."" Who has the number 1? Sure. Okay, this is Amanda begins. You have 32 seconds to answer a ton of questions. And... Here we go. Lily's favorite color? It's Robin. I think Ted whispered the word ""yellow"". It is equally untrue. (Later...) This game is called... raising the cost of perfection. Thank you. You wrote all that you love our queen of the day. And Lilypad, you must guess who wrote what. ""From his friends to his students, Lily that everyone in his life..."" ""... feel loved. She makes the best cookies oatmeal raisin-, The Goonies knows by heart... "" ""And that's the strongest person I know. I can not imagine my life without her. I love you, Lily. Too cute. Lily, guess who wrote it. ""You look really nice."" Who wants a party hat? I'm a bird! All do the bird! Or we could continue the descent on the Avenue Best Birthday. My friends, I made a song for tonight. Follow me, the chorus is this: Merry, Merry Lily-anniversary... Actually, sorry, man. I had you taken to Lily. They are not all bad. Like... this. Look. I have my eyes open. 2 months. And I just started making love. I was not ready to stop for 2 months. I'm so excited to remake love. 2 months! My balls were blue! Blue! Attention Lily. It's a trap. It puts an end to all this conversation about the bitches.Back to the birthday song! Barney, your part is this: ""She's cute She's cute."" You must order more food? Look. We're all friends again! Now working on the harmonies. Merry, Merry Lily-versary! Merry, Merry Lily-versary! ""42nd""? Does the f*cking b*mb appeared to have 42 years? Or worse, she has a mind to call Lori?! If Lily is serious. Get out of this stranger in my house! Out! You've ruined Lily's birthday and you want me to apologize? At worst, you should apologize. You bring her girls at our parties, and it lets them believe that things are serious. After the largues when you, you know to whom they turn? Me. I was the cleaning crew of your girlfriends for years. I had just returned from a marathon to study the law library. Hi, Natalie, where is Ted? You know what? I have not slept for 36 hours. Just a few minutes. And at first I was totally sympathetic. But damn, Ted, over the years, you made me cynical. I'll get us something to eat, and we'll talk about it until it is clear. Me too. Yeah. But you know, life goes darling. Shut up. Cheap Shot. Low blow. It's not that she would not, but she said that penguins are zero. Penguins. Actually, it was a good evening. It's true. No! Why not sitcom of the 80s with two roommates who never agree? Yeah. Just one second per cons. We are writing history. We'll take our first picture of roommate. What are you doing, Ted? And if one breaks? Come. Your brain is too predictable associations."

Every year my mother took tea with her friend Easter Bell. Not so funny. It was there, we know the end. The funny for this photo. I plottait ass. Wait. Look at these pictures. Barney always has the same pose and all these years. It's gotta be a lousy picture of you. And in elementary school? We all have school pictures ugly. A crisp, Barney? I! A photo ugly. No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips? This is what happened in Paris? It's terrible. My laptop is just... fell. You me collected?(Barney looks to pick it up) Mouse, m*therf*cker! I! Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing! I'm sorry, Ted. I agree with Lily on this. This kind of evening is hard for someone new. That's why I have not brought Don. When I was in Japan, this guy, hot date for our third, took me to his brother's wedding. Now I, a complete stranger, am on the photo album of the marriage of a Japanese couple forever. I'm starting to cry. And you got me pinched cheeks very hard for them to be pink. And then we all ate chocolate cake in my bed. I think Lori's age made him very wise. It's a hole in your jacket? Shit! Yes!"

After that, she had real problems of trust. Wait, I'll find Amanda. Wait... You do not want Amanda on the picture, right? Lily, what's the matter? Tell me the truth. Lily, what are you talking? That's not true. That's Pap Pa...... I remember, this is Sarah. Normal if it is good guitarist. Lily, sorry for Amanda. But I'll say. You make your spoiled rotten. You in all your statements because you think I messed up two three photos? I'm so excited you're here. Really? Because I think I want to tell you the same thing. I feel sorry for Paris and group photos ruined, but... when you're single, you must hope that every girl is good. I mean, Erin.Irene. And Sarah. At the time, I thought each of these girls could be good, but I have to keep hoping. I have no choice. Because Robin is your best friend. Your best friend on Earth. Before being your best friend, what was she? That's it. One of my random sluts. I bring these girls to party because you are important. You are my family. Here's the disgusting smelly hippie with whom I go out. I did not say that! Here's Framboise. No. Raspberry does not eat. I confess. Raspberry was a mistake. But how would I know? If this is so important, Amanda is not in the picture. It does not spoil your birthday. Give him a chance. Amanda refuses to return. She thinks you hate it. Marshall, you have to go apologize. What are you talking? Sorry that my search for love has you so upset. You know, your precious photos might be better if I was not over. You know what these pictures? A big lie. We ask. They are retouched. They are what you want but not the reality. Oh? Look at that one. Halloween, there is 2 years old. You had not played because you wanted to disguise yourself as a penguin. And yet you're there, smiling as if nothing was wrong, completely wrong. Robin's birthday, there is 3 years old. Robin had a cold, and you made him remove his pajamas for the photo. Yeah, that was good. Do you remember what happened? Wait, we take what poses? The two cops friends? And if you came to ask us? Yeah. And if you break it? I liked you. Really? Thank you, Lil. Marshall, try this. Keep your eyes closed until the last second and when I say, open them. Now, Marshall! Ann has...? Anna?"
1418,5,18,woman ,"Names that bitch! I just thought we had something special, you know? I know if I'll get over it."
1419,5,18,,"Ted (2030): Children, your aunt Lily has always been among those who like their birthday. Really. The alarm goes off at 12: 00 and Lily wakes. Ted (2030): It's a good thing she married Marshall. The clock shows 9: 00. Ted (2030): Because he loves to prepare on birthdays. Ted (2030): Children, have you seen the photo album of Lily... Bound in leather, acid-free paper, adorable handwritten captions. And most importantly, the group photo. Nice picture, eh? But what you do not see are the 10 seconds before this photo was taken. Ted (2030): We hated group photos of Lily. Ted (2030): He was right. Your uncle Marshall is many things well, but for the pictures, it's terrible. Marshall Robin. Your part is this: ""And nice and sweet and so nice! "" Ted (2030): Children, you remember the look ""you're dead to me"" Lily, she has this expression before exploding in a rage?Well, that was not it. But it was that of Marshall. Ted (2030): So your aunt Lily called Amanda."

1421,5,19,barney ,"I love traveling. Hawaii is fun. A buddy of mine lives in Seattle. It's really not bad. But the best place? I must say, the moon. Ted, a blonde, it's easy. Our ship is passed through a hole spatiotemporal or gamma rays or something. I started to rejuvenate, blah, blah, blah. So you bump into one store yoghurt. It must be insane. So, after 20 minutes, the eagle has landed. We fuse into space. Houston, we have a complainer. Other double entender related to space. I do not lie! We made love, I have pictures! I'm not saying he loves pizza, but the last time he went, the doctor said, ""stop eating pizza. ""Marshall:"" Why? ""Doc:"" To you examine. "" But seriously, we laugh because we love you. Who? He wore a black hat and beard of the day? He said ""Hands up! ""? It was downright terrifying. I repeat. I will say that it happened to me to lie on compassion. I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life. It's great. But I think I'll add a tear. It's gold! But I'd rather say 'put me behind you. "" So it was indeed a black bonnet. J'l'avais said! I do not ask where he kept his weapon. You're telling us... You've been mugged by a monkey? Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet? New information has been discovered on the attack on Marshall. No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana... You're right. The banana was on the floor. Marshall, I'm sorry, really. Here's what happened. I've just been mugged. That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now... It was downright terrifying. I would just like to forget what happened and continue to live my life. Well, my name is not Neil. This is Bar... Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3? And it was the best thing in my life 3. The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts... So what you're saying is that you got the monkey trapped so you give him your wallet? You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat? I can not believe. You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous. If serious, this is too funny. I, yes, but still. You know a long time. He told the truth? I still say that it happened. Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body. False! They like to discover that they lied. ""Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth."" Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this! No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said. Passed. Who wants to do something to 3? (The two women throw their glasses to him the figure) Lisa, wait. It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied. 31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world! You know it. Yeah! I knew it. Come on, Ted. Why he would invent something like that? Dude, what do you do? Now I want a weapon. You know if it was attacked? It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good. Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way. Of course, Ted."

1423,5,19,lily ,"This is the pizza. Baby, you got the cash? What!? I even caught a pizza in the shower. You...? Did you get mugged? Not a bit. I do not think there's a g*n to my Marshmallow. Now, I tremble. I think I will not sleep all night. Baby, do not worry for me, I mean, yes, I'm a little scared, but I am New York. I will not let me change it. I changed! I like the weapons now. Charger. I said, ""shipper"". No one who scares. A tiny Beretta pink that goes with these cute sandals I just bought. In fact, our new credit card works. I have changed my mind. I know, you're right, but every time I close my eyes, I see this guy pointing a g*n at you. And... you're my world, Marshall. If something happened to you one day, I would... He assaulted you naked? Forget the weapon. It is on that now. This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a gang?I hope he will climb to see us. I think naked in a tree, throwing his feces. You've been mugged by a monkey! It would be nice to see you on TV. You've been mugged by a monkey. Well done! I have too much sleep last night. Can you imagine that I almost buy a g*n? I'm glad you assaulted by a monkey. I bet he will love it. You have not been attacked by a monkey? It's good. I buy a g*n. Tell us just what happened."

You see, we will separate him from his wife, Milly. They have been together long. So Bobo goes. Did you or not, was attacked by Captain Bobo? Bobo, just there, Bobo. Bobo, come here."
1427,5,19,marshall ,"But I worked at a yogurt shop in high school. And indeed, it was... insane. What? You had not interviewed the mayor? You have nabbed seven in a row? Again? You know, in fact, it was not me who should pay.Because I do not really like pizza. Okay, so I have no money on me... it's because... I was assaulted. You can pay Arthur? I have the slab! How is your father, anyway? That's good. Yes, because I was assaulted in 1947 at the corner of Abbott and Costello. But no. I cut through Central Park back from work. It's good. It's good. It was downright terrifying. What are you doing? It will not work. If? I authorize you to do. Okay, you know what? We'll all calm down. We do not need a g*n. I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life. Listen baby, I know it's scary, but look at me. I'm fine.You can put this behind us? You wanna buy a g*n? You do not need a weapon. All studies in the world come together to say that a home is safer with no weapon, especially ours. You know how I ever hurt you unintentionally. Pretty easy, huh? (And send the cork in the eye of Lily. Marshall and Lily sleeping when Marshall is a slap to Lily. Marshall before the fridge and opens the door when Lily arrives. They dance loose Lily and Marshall) Dispatch, baby. The party will begin. (Lily is dressed up and scared a killer Marshall puts his fist) You had to disguise yourself in sexy chat! Now, you want to add a weapon in this equation? I know. I know. Listen, I must confess something. This attack did not go exactly as I said. He wore no black cap. It is wearing nothing at all. It's good. It's good. No, guys. I came home from work on foot. Through Central Park, and I stopped at the zoo. It's good. It's good. For a monkey. I got mugged by a monkey. Yeah, I got mugged by a monkey. I was embarrassed, so I invented another story. The important, Lily, you do not need a weapon. Because I saw that the monkey did and I wanted more after. They tracked. Okay. That's what happened. I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well. Was not... Was not banana banana. Do not shoot. There was no banana! This part is right. It is not unusual, right? Thailand, China, Costa Rica, people are attacked by monkeys all the time.They are gatherers. Because of their dynamic inter-social, have a predisposition to flight, gives them a genetic advantage. Can you promise me to present it so that I am not ridiculous to myself assaulted by a monkey? You're the lemon in your hair. Really? Cool. Nobody except the good people of Thailand, China, Costa Rica and many other countries where the crime committed by the monkeys is a common nuisance. Me too. Guys, it will not. I can not do that. That's not it. Guys... I'm not assaulted by a monkey. Not at all. No, that's not it. Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a g*n. I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a weapon. In truth, it never happened. What? I would not? Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends. But I can not lie on national TV. Ted, do not do that... You mean what you done to him. You got me. I was just nervous. I got mugged by a monkey. Come on, Ted. The monkey is there. The name of his companion is Milly? Well... I'd love to tell you what happened, Robin. But... I really want to know what's under that sheet. People are attacked every day in New York, Robin, do we often see what's under that sheet? You can shoot it? I have not really been attacked by a monkey. I invented it for that Lily buys a g*n. What are you talking, baby? Of course I do. Not five minutes. I have not been attacked by a monkey. No. I got mugged. No! I have not been mugged! Okay! That is the truth. I go back... back to bed."

(The cameraman has fun throwing papers) were returned. Yeah, I understand. A single interview proper, it would be nice for a change. Ted, you've nabbed seven peanuts in a row. Impressive but not enough to be published. That's the thing with which you played the other day? Ten seconds. Oh, sweetie. I have a trick to help you sleep. (She pulls out his g*n) Glue this under your pillow. You'll sleep like a f*cking baby. It's going to hurt someone. There is the... security. Maybe there should be a pause.. Really? They caught him? So, where did they find? I've seen. That's why I take the taxi. What's happening? Come on, Barney. I know that Marshall has not been mugged by a monkey. No one wants to see a guy who comes to play with dolls. So, your dolls are favorites of Rhinebeck prices next month. Because the FBI wanted to be occupied while they searched his home. Come on, Marshall. I need history. It has everything. Crime, monkeys, no stupid model of the Empire State Building, which takes me all my living room and smelly glue everywhere. Go. Do this for me... As a friend? Who knows someone who has been mugged by a monkey? The best is that it is possible that the story goes on national TV. Guys, this story of the monkey attacker can make me famous. Do not be nervous. We will sit down... It's that thing, whore? It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid. Surprise. We thought it would help to bring you to confront your abuser. In your own words, describe what happened. We talk about that. We speak your aggression. We come back. What are you doing? Great, tell it to America. Five minutes. Yes, tell us the truth. Shit. Okay, put a microphone."

Okay, I look at my calendar, see when I'm available. But I want a list of questions in advance and nothing about my private life. seven in a row. But I speak not of it. I talk about my selection for the construction of a scale model of the Empire State Building for the greater recovery of the New York skyline in the world. I was playing it. I was working. ""It's you. """" It's me. """" I saw you in the street. """" Are you Annie? """" Yes. "" How long are you here? Yeah, just the end. It was literally across the country a hundred times for a pizza. What? Robin puts it. Wait, so... We're sure it was a weapon? What you got mugged... The monkeys attack people? It really is a jungle out. He is behind bars. You know how they caught him, huh? They tracked! It might be curious. You were wearing a yellow hat? What? Him in your program? And my model? First, it was not what you think. Secondly, you got a guy playing with dolls. And you invited back for a second interview. What? Funny, you look like you just got two vodka and tonic in the face. It's a little embarrassing. So what? So, you've not been mugged by a monkey? So you got the monkey attacked? That would be the right size. I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say. Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible. It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them. Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey. Come here. Seriously, what's your flavor? It's intoxicating. I know. Looks like something covered by a sheet. If you want to discover, you will have to do a story on it. I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York. I have no idea. Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess. Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you. I doubt it. It's really happening?"

Ted (2030): No one played as well as Barney with this limit. A breeze for him. Robin, out of his room: Ted? You redo the end of Sleepless in Seattle with Polly Pocket? Robin, who happens: Hi, friends. What's new? Robin, entering: Marshall, you never will believe. I spoke to my producer monkey aggressor and he loves! Lily, what happens: This is the belt of Planar 3? Ted (2030): Late the next night, we went on board the issue of Robin. Ted (2030): And then the interview began. Ted (2030): And that's when Marshall realized that there was one thing to say. Ted (2030): And that was it. We never knew what really happened to the portfolio of Marshall. But we know that. Aunt Lily has never had a weapon, Robin's credibility remained intact, and Bobo and Milly lived together at the Central Park Zoo. Ted (2030): The children you will not believe what happened.

And then I just tell you guys what Robin has done, but you were there for. I must tell you the rest of the wedding. Aunt Meredith! Robin whining during the song Clint. Oh, I've already said. The super good sister of Ted, Heather! Uncle Larry, sky gods. Niagara Falls. It is empty. Sorry Robin. They are all out of pretzels. And I know how you're emotional. (He gives her a stack of paper towels) Shh. Leave it alone. She cried to the song of Clint. And that was fine with Blair Witch, and she tried to haggle on closing costs? Is it in the room with us right now, Ted? The dumbest thing that ON've ever done. No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened. Put rockets in... Gamin. You know, I'm glad Robin have guessed. Because it is really sensitive and fragile. I talk about the times she cried during the song Clint. And while I whisper, I hope she hears me. I know it's silly, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know? I shall spin you 500 dollars if it happened to you instead of me. Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done. Wait, you're... Wait, wait. You will inspect the place where now? It was Robin! ""What! ""Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know. Of course. Shit. I see a complaint. Thank you. My God. OK, buddy. Sometimes people make bad decisions in life. Like your mother. Ted, as you know, I've always been really, really addicted to your mother. Actually, Virginia and I spent a special time in 2006.Before Clint. I wanted to be your father! Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that b*st*rd stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport. And that's how you got the pin? Incredible. You... So... here we go. It is a good time. Not much traffic... Is it true? Hmm. I can... Listen... Ted's mother. I... I should really... Okay, that's good. Well, I invented the last, but everything else, I swear it was true. Come on, man. Your mother is a cougar. Okay, this is a Mellencamp. Your mother and I were at second base."
1438,5,20,clint ,"Ted, your mother is really a woman... really erotic boy. As a painter, slash, composer, slash, voluntary combatant with fear. I find it incredibly... sensual. But you have s*x own memories of your mother, right? Exciting her nipple, receiving her milk. You follow me?Fine. Oh, well... because that was an ad to make you... Son. Son, to show you that your mother and I will always be there for you, I want you to have this beautiful picture I have painted. I'm sorry, Ted. Hello everyone. Mahallow to be there with us. Throughout my life, well, this life. I waited a muse as Virginia. Girl... this is your song."
1439,5,20,lily ,"Oh, congratulations! Seriously, Ted is fine? I mean, I know that the weekend was hard, but hey... it's weird radio silence. Ted, where were you? Yeah, but where we're going to end? We do not want to know what you do on the internet when you feel alone. What, are you saying that you bought the house? Ted, you're barge. It will take years and a small fortune for it to be liveable. Ted, you can not go on like this where you will make your life. It does not work like that. Bourre. What? Ted, stop that. You can not keep this house. This is a huge mistake. You see, you should have waited to see all the problems that home. Boy, you've almost had us still. Oh, stay there. Huge hole on the second floor. I just want to be sure the report is accurate. Listen, Ted... Usually in life, when you make a huge mistake, you must learn to live with. But how many times you got the chance to take a mass break out and all? A Ted Mosby, owner, friends, and if he can rent it, Slumlord."

But on the bright side, the pond in your basement drowned rats the biggest and slowest.The others, well... They go by. Not so fast. (He brings Lily in the room) was some form of problem here. These hips are not suitable for a baby Eriksen.And that thing she does not have the right filter. This is a maintenance problem that never leave. And I know you think like this gothic look now. But basically, you've always imagined with a Spanish style? I would recommend you take a look at the options in the lease. Well, good news. I think we all will soon be out of here. Yes, I ended up downstairs and outside. Now, I could continue to look and see what I could do except black mold, bearing walls damaged, frayed electrical son, lead paint, water damage, fire damage, sun damage, off the cares, the floor is rotting... Oh, look at that, not termites. The chimney cracked, bats, rats, spiders, raccoons, the tramp, the gutter parts, the old fuse box, paint the kitchen which is not bad, but really swear the plates with the plans working. Or I could advise you not to buy this miserable house Guantanamo Bay, and suggest you break all by before a wind blowing through all son of bitches from here. I'll see at the top if all goes well. Found termites."

1443,5,20,marshall ,"We're so happy for you! Wait, Ted. And your speech? Ted, Ted, what are you doing? It is the marriage of your mother! Hey, man, you would not possibly let someone who does not like a kind of mania old driving license? Try not to laugh with you that, man. Look out, man. Okay, well. Ted let alone a little, right? Okay? We all did stupid stuff in our lives. For example, I remember once when I put the rocket in the bathroom and tried to put them to dry in the microwave. Oh, my God, guys! Great new game: ""Drunk or child? ""I was what? Guess. Drum roll, please. I was... Drunk! Okay! Well! Well, just remember that we all did stupid stuff in our lives, okay? For example, once I tried to cycle on an extension ladder to a roof of a two-story house. The only question is I was a kid or drunk? Drum roll, please. I was... A kid! Mom, are you? You always make a fuss about nothing. Hmm... sausage party? Exactly. Now, I currently drive the car of my brother in the opposite direction on I-94. Now that was a big mistake. I was... a kid. I know this is our second hot date but, Lily Aldrin, I will marry you. You're always a little too far. He said he had found a tramp? Again?! One too many! Hey, man. Robin told me. Happy Housewarming! I know what you said. I also know my best friend, Ted Mosby. Listen... for all time, all the years I have told you... ""Slow! Not go too fast with this girl! ""You've not heard a single f*cking time. Your heart is both drunk and child. That's what I do. Yeah."
1444,5,20,mother ,I can not believe I'm with this man. It's so cool! And he chooses! I feel like my 19 years. It is as if the past 35 years had never happened. Marshall is dead! Marshall died!
1445,5,20,older woman, You marry when?
1446,5,20,robin ,"Best... I know it's stupid, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know? I know. His mother called such five times to ask where he was. Okay! Okay, I... I cried during the song Clint. Is that okay? Whoa. Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done. My God, you had to be completely stuffed. Children? Why... Bourre. It was not me! It's not me who cried during the song Clint. Are you crying? Not as much as me. $ 500? No worries. Wow, Barney. You've been crying about this guy or what? Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem? I made a mistake in letting you go, right? Your pen1s is huge. Hey, good, good news is that the inspector has k*lled some cockroaches at the time of impact. Wait, I thought you said that a cougar could not be more than 50 years. It was our turn."
1447,5,20,ted ,"Please do not. Please, stop. Mom, mom, it's good. You're not obliged to ask you with him. There's full of guys... Yeah! Finally, I... I'm glad you're happy. I love to listen to you, Mom. Oh my God. I gotta go. Inventing an emergency or anything. I... I... I'll get it. Hi, guys. Oh, that's fine. I'm in top form. Go. We'll take a look! First, let me tell you what happened on the wedding day. Watching my mother to marry, I realized how I was late in relation to it on my life. I'm just going to leave here. So I walked into my hotel room and I went on a website where I go sometimes when I have trouble sleeping. I have not spent... It is not that part of the night I was talking about. I was on my favorite site for real estate auction... Come on, we all did... visit some properties on the site. Guys... I just bought the house of my dreams. I mean, I put an online auction and I won the next day and I was accepted. I have just finalized all the paperwork. So, I thought this piece would be the desktop. You see, a place just for dad. I mean, kids can come if they read a book, but no toy. This is not about to hold my love. It is rather a question of drawing a boundary. I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move. Okay, okay. I know. I have not found Ms. Mosby yet, but I will get it. Knock on wood. Thank you. Gamin. Oh, great! I began to think that you would not come. Hmm. Well, yeah. Hey, check the porch, huh? Go. I will put a gate there.Every Sunday here, it'll be a huge party sausage. Burgers, burgers will be made. Lily, listen to me. I had a plan, right? A woman, a house, children, and it turned out that the universe is really shit to what is the wife and children. So what is the thing I can control? The house I bought. It's not a huge mistake. You can always have problems with any decision, but you can not let that stop you. First day in college, Marshall knew he wanted to spend his life with you. And if someone was there to contradict his decision? But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both. Really? And if I had already bought the son of a bitch? Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here. You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie? Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house. What do you mean? Please, stop. What are you talking about? What does that mean? Guys, I'm in trouble. I mean, the best I can do is to improve the house and sell the property with great losses. It's silly. Thank you Lily. It was fantastic. There... there is one last thing I should do. Hi. I have not been able to make your speech. I was selfish and I freaked out and I'm so sorry, so... and here... ""A hand sign for the Dj? Dee made the sign... ""I pass. ""Mom, I love you, and I've never seen him so happy with Clint. And Clint, welcome in the family... what you both is what I'd really like to have someday. But in the meantime, health to you both. I love you. "" Hey. How did you know that I would be here today? But I told you the last time I saw you I was coming home. Please stay here with me, man. I can... I can give you some ideas I have?"

1451,5,20,,"Ted (2030): Children, everybody has at least a moment to take a huge decision, a crazy decision that will change their lives forever. This is a story of mine. Ted (2030): It all started with a visit to my mother and her boyfriend for a long time, Clint, who always said things in the style... Ted (2030): Yes, my mother was lapping. I married for the second time before I get married once. I was so happy for them.f*cking happy. While weddings can be magical. As far as I know, I'll end up dancing with my future wife in this marriage. Ted (2030): It was not her. Ted (2030): Children, there was no guitar. Marshall:... marriage... Lily:... never... Barney:... seen. Ted (2030): Children, I swear, I remember the 12 minutes following. So I have no idea of the end of the song. Clint, singing: And Mahatma Gandhi. And pancakes. Well all together! And the dragon. And you. Ted (2030): Children, I can not exaggerate how horrible it is to be a single guy in his mother's second marriage. Ted (2030): And my friends I have not seen during the next 72 hours. Ted (2030): And my friends have not seen during the next 72 hours. Ted (2030): There was no reason why my mother could be with a guy like that. However, as you know children, be with Grandpa Clint was the best decision taken what did your grandmother.(Ted returns to the house he bought) Sometimes our best decisions are those that really have no meaning. Ted (2030): And, children, Marshall was right. I have not given up my dream home because that's the thing with the stupid decisions. It makes them all. But time is funny. And sometimes a little magic. It may take a stupid decision... and turn it into something sensible. For children, as you know, this house... our house is."

As a former... before you embark on anything, I'm meeting this guy. I think it's pretty weird not having yet met. I promise. I'm doing this contortionist Portuguese, and I swear... it is so flexible, at a time, it was about me and beneath me. A top and a bottom! One and two! Which is empty? I appreciate you, Don. Both, we love a good scotch, one likes my stories compelling. And we went out with Robin. In short, the arms of the Erasmus student have dropped and there fell of my swing. Seriously, I have not found a girl who can do that from Robin. Well, there you should also apologize. We said some pretty hurtful. That was after you to be part. I can not wait, buddy. I have to get Robin. I do not know what it is, but I want to get Robin. I had perhaps not done playing with. I just left to play with something else for a while. Ready for what? Hanging out with Robin was a huge mistake. What? My pleasure. Dear Barney... the future... This ink is too cool. You... and Robin... I understand. I really want it back. It's too easy. My chair! Me too, man. More than you, certainly. Instance. Super spicy. I feel bad. This pepper is an ice cube in my mouth. Don Tokyo... You ever do that... in Japan? Wasabi! I stay on my position. It was bold and romantic. Come on. Did you do stupid stuff to impress Robin. You have not turned the page. You want it as much as me, but you not admit it. For my biographer? Okay. We must get rid of him. You know, metaphorically. Or... literally. That's how it starts! I'm afraid, Teddy! Robin Stinson! Robin Stinson! Okay, wait. What do you say to that? It is being shared?I take up to 40 years and after you can have it. You're right. I go to you... I go to the bathroom. And then I'll break... It's BarnExclussif. Ted calls you? Indeed, he has a problem. It's true. I'm going to leave before something regrettable. Robin, I love you! I brought the blue French horn! Ted has just given me.Sorry, I was there before you. All right! Here we go! You, Me and Ted! We won the fingers in the nose... Good night, Dad. Dad? Damn, Ted was torn. Embarrassing... So what's going on with Robin? I agree. In fact... I even wrote another letter. Dear Barney the future, you think you want to get Robin, thou wilt not true. Let her. Sincerely, Barney's past. Give me that. In my defense, the breasts, is not it great?"

But I pity any woman with self-esteem so low it would go out with him. So Barney's your ex and you hang out with him? It makes me uncomfortable. It's not weird that Robin is still friends with Barney? I do not know how to react to the fact that she hangs out with an ex. But if you had someone and he hung out with an ex... He was friends with his ex. When I found out that your roommate is single, I was a little jealous, but now that I know he's gay, so good. Thank you. Ted is not it? Lily, be honest. It's not weird that Robin train with an ex? Ted? And Robin? You're also out with Ted? 4 people you consider your best friends, you've slept with 50% of them. But they are also your ex. And you live with one of them.I'm sorry. I have to think about all that. I came to apologize to you. I exaggerated. Not at all. I acts as a hysteric. It's not offensive, right? Sorry, I meant you're both important to Robin. How about dinner tomorrow night at home. You're welcome. Do you like sushi? I do too. It is more spicy, the better. Great. Super. My ex and I thought it would be a good idea but they separated. It yes, with his personal trainer. But if Robin decides to move, I bought a giant bed. If you moved in. We have more milk. Thank you for the reminder, Robin. Come on, get. Robin and I have to go to work. Sit down watching TV and will be discussed when we come back, okay? Right there. You're welcome. Good night, guys."
1455,5,21,lily ,"You said what? It still seems fast. Atrocious. Twin beds? I can not sleep in separate beds. We should complain. Yeah, I'll go with you in just a second...... We missed the full board. Ted and Robin broke up there for years. This is not a problem. It should have separate beds. a deal! I know. I love you, but I want this new bed is a sanctuary of my sleep and my sleep only. A bed for s*x. For hot s*x and bestiality. Right. There will be two beds for sleeping, one for s*x, and I thought an ottoman for birthdays. And how. From spicy tuna? My favorite. We just had. Wait. This ""super"" does not look great. I'm worried. I do not want that divorce. We can at least get closer? Why? You're not perfect either. Between the food and ants. But... I still want to be with you. We're getting closer? Nope. What? You throw me like that?"
1456,5,21,marshall ,"Terrible. Yeah, you're right, I'll ask for another room. You can come back later? It takes a nap. We spent 18 hours. I lost 5 kg. Yes, a mini fridge. And separate beds. Humans are not made to share a bed. s*x and sleep are associated, but these are two different things. Me too. And snacks, but that's all. You know what we should do? Buy a third bed to make love. Awesome. That way, each bed will have its uses. Baby, you come to revolutionize modern marriage? You will not believe. Don also has twin beds. But I bet you have no special bed s*x. This is Don. It's not us. Our new way to sleep is only going to get closer. Now, get out of my bed. Sure. You spoke of the beds. No, I'm not. I love you more than anything, but you're worse than a kettle. I'm surprised that your pee breaks are not as steam. To hit me and slam me all night? I swear, as soon as you fall asleep, it looks like it push you arms. One would think sleeping with an Indian goddess. You speak of beds yet? Come here. It was good. Well, you gotta go. I'm sorry. It was great and you're great. But, I must get up early, so... You knew before you start. (Lily gets up to join his bed) Wait. Forget your sweater. Nice try."
1457,5,21,robin ,"Well... it's a bit early... but... of course, I might consider... I moved here, let me think. Yeah, that's what I was talking about me too. As I said, let me think. I agree. I thought about it. We have the same job, Barney. You're probably right. Really? You wanna throw me out because of something with milk? No. I have a system. I put the empty brick in the fridge to remind us to buy milk. Bluntly. It's as if someone was orchestrating things for this specific purpose. Okay, but you must promise to behave well. And it was Barney. The'm not, it's as if we had never been together. How was your weekend, or any other topic? Your teacher of calligraphy called... Your ink arrived. Ted is not... Ted will not be much there. It follows Cher's tour. It's just my friends. Sorry for not having told the truth from the beginning. Thank you. So long, guys. Don made sushi, it's cool, huh? He learned in Japan. I would love. If I move. spit, spit! BarnExclussif, not quit. I have a double appeal. No. Ted, not quit. I'll remember. Ted is on the other line... and I think he has a problem. What's the matter? Thank you. The Teddy Bear, BarnExclussif. We get up, fuckers. You remember last night? Don will not be part of the group. Neither do I. At least for a while. Guys... with Don, it works well. I want to see where it goes. And I could not do it if I continue to hang out with my ex. It will not. I moved in with Don."
1458,5,21,ted ,"You should live with him. Yeah, you're happy with him, and i adore you as a roommate, I want you to do what is right for you. It's super boring. Robin?! Why not let the solid brick to remind us not to buy? Actually, I'm not sure. It's odd that we all still be friends with Barney. Trainer with an ex okay, two at a pinch. Shit, two is even better. Because strawberry... Wait, sorry. ""It? "" Wait, wait. You think I'm gay? Why you would assume that? And? Yes. But we still house boudoirs and hot dogs. Think again, Cher made some great concerts. But I'm not gay. I'm so gay, eh, Donnie? Thank you. Still not gay. It's great. Are you kidding? I know what it is. You're like... a kid who threw his toys and wants them back as soon as another plays with. You ready. To read the letter. Dear Ted future, never returns with Karen, because it is a pretentious snob. And she has deceived you. Sorry that you discover the way. You see? We laugh now. Dear Ted future, stay away from Natalie. And girls who beat you to the ground for no reason, before a cheering crowd. PS... Check out a shrink to find out why it has you a little excited. Dear genius relations, Stella has left you at the altar, you'll love me maybe more. And you will surely die alone. It's not so sad written in calligraphy. Write it. Write yourself a letter. That way you will remember the reasons for the break when you miss. Right? Get it? Be nice. You want it just because you can not have it. Like saying ""Sit wherever you want, except on that chair."" You will be so... Great! Give her milk! Well, I hope you're happy. You were emptied from the top and bottom. Yes, but not anymore, because I turned the page. Just like you. That's ridiculous and I'll tell you why. Concentrate on the letter, ok? At Ted, Robin is the ideal girl for you, but she will not engage. You need someone who wants to settle. So, until Robin is ready for this, it is not for you. I still remember stealing the blue French horn, our first kiss, her eyes when she told me she loved me. And shit. I want it back. I stole a blue french horn for her... I was with her for a year.I wanted her to be the mother of my children and spend eternity in his arms. It's not for you! And it's not mine, either. It is... to Don. Of course. We all talk! Robin Mosby! Ted Scherbatsky. I would take his name. I do not care. Who we laugh? It is with Don. We must accept it and move on. It's Teddy Bear. Want some honey? There's that you have beautiful hair. Front and back. We almost lose control. Species of b*st*rd! I brought the blue French horn! I want you back! Something to three. You abandoned easily. Game, set and match! Where's this great TV? I'm sorry. It is both. We drank and we were stupid, but... We will do everything we can to ensure that Don is part of the group. You were right, she was just angry. It's been four days and not talk to relocate. We must never repeat this kind of shit. Let me see! Ps... The top was for Ted. He believed? Fine. Pull yourself together with Robin, but say nothing to Ted because he will still go wrong. And there are still drawings of breasts. Too great. Robin?!"
1459,5,21,voice ,Maid! It's time to return the keys.
1460,5,21,,"Ted (2030): Children, your Aunt Robin was dating Don until recently, but one evening, coming from nowhere... Ted (2030): Robin had never told Don she was out with Barney. Ted (2030): There, he knew it. Ted (2030): Robin had said nothing either to Don about another of his ex. Me. Ted, leaving her room: I wanted to ensure that Project Runway is registering. The uniform changed to the Jets? Ted, an apron: I think there will be no creme brulee tonight. My torch to brown is broken. Lily, thinking: Her toenails are daggers. Lily, thinking: Great! And now he falls asleep. Hello, river of slime. Marshall, thinking: My knee itches. I'll just scratch a little. Ted (2030): Children, I invented the letter to remind me of the reasons for a breakup. I did it for years. Ted (2030): When Barney and Robin have broken in the fall before... Barney:... a couple were atrocious. It did not work. You always love Robin, but remember the other women... And above all, the other breast, and all the cool stuff you do with breasts... Y to the head, juggle... squeaker squeaker... I'm a hopeless romantic.And there are drawings of breasts. Ted (2030): So that night, with Barney, we sat down to talk calmly and reasonably to the most deserving Robin. Barney:... I want to sleep with her, at least one last time. She is mine! Robin, at the window: Guys, what do you do?"
1461,5,22,barney ,"Guess what I have behind my back. Not a good game but okay. Five tickets well placed to Robots vs. Wrestlers. You know Robots vs. Wrestlers? That's exactly it, according to the website! Uh... Robin. I know... She lives with her boyfriend and she said not wanting to hang out with us, but it's Robots vs. Wrestlers. Robots vs.... Wrestlers! She said no? How could she? Robots vs. Wrestlers of our tradition is the largest group. It's Robots vs. Wrestlers, Lily. This is obviously a tradition. It starts like this. First, Robin moves in with Don and Marshall and Lily have a baby, then Ted... I was going to say ""was found eaten by her cats,"" but it's not good either. Everybody leaves me, and I like it! You're right. I exaggerate with this story of Robin. What is an announcement? Wife Robin Don. I'll die alone! Ted eventually eaten by her cats! Marissa Heller? She looks good. Face, breasts, describe. Begins with the breasts. We change the plan for Saturday. Evening Marissa Heller for alcohol and Robots vs. Wrestlers. But one of us should pretend to Marissa Heller. Guys, we get together. Lil, you can do... All you have to watch the guy in front, say your name is Marissa Heller, and it passes. And I repeat, to be sure, no accent. I do we go to the party, that's what! (He goes to Marissa) We met at the meeting of ornithophilic. Lovers of wicker? I said I'd get us. In a coined word ""asshole-Apocalypse."" This morning I made the heart of the Ambassador of the Netherlands. I hope he gets better. As Undersecretary of Finance, I had a great influence on this legislation. Now, I wonder if you will accompany me in the map room to stimulate my package. Zsa Zsa Gabor is still sexy, but other than that, it is rotten this holiday. But you never missed Robots vs. Wrestlers. It happens that way. First Robin us loose, and now you? And for those pretentious snobs and old game? It's an evening. It means everything. If you come not to Robots vs. Wrestlers, it's the end of our friendship. All right. So you do most of our group, forever. You can ask to return in 2 years. Come see wrestlers fight like robots. I'm embarrassed. I forgot something. You crazy not me, Marshall. Let's be honest. The group is finite. Ted is gone, like Robin. That separates us as well. Wait. Why do you say that all of a sudden? My God, you're pregnant! My God, have you ever had the baby! It is just behind me, huh? You can at least promise to not get pregnant within a year? You can not? No! You can not have children! You want to raise a child in this crazy world. Okay, Lily, I have no choice. If you have a daughter, day, no, the minute she is 18... Gong! I hope Ted is unhappy. Okay, you can have a baby, but only under the following conditions: 1-You promise to always love me more than the baby, 2-Once a month, I can use to shake the baby, 3 - It may include a drop baby from the first floor and that saves me; 4-No breastfeeding in front of me. Forget the five-four, get out your breasts when you want. Rule number 83. If something out of the baby ends up on my costume, I can touch the breasts of Lily. It is not I who make the rules. Look who thinks he can come here and repeat the group. Well, you can forget. Pity, remake the group! I want to lose anyone yet! We're sorry. You can recite all the poems of assh*le that you want, we never say anything bad on it, I promise."
1462,5,22,lily ,"Wait, wait. I will find. Left. Wait, wait. Who is the fifth ticket? I assume you're talking about cooking, otherwise I would have other issues. I understand. You're right. We miss you much. Tradition? It was never done. Do not worry about a baby on our side. It is not yet started. A small long road. Very, very far. Oh? I see it. Open it. I just got a text from Robin. It says... It is certain that it is not English, though? Okay! I do. I go there. (A young woman arrives) Sorry. Go ahead. Damn it then! What do we do? So... nobody saw The Young and the Restless? Great! Who commissioned illustrated soap? Marissa Heller, I like your style. No one? Do I understand that there is not one fan of soap in this elevator? We tried, it's been 20 minutes. We are going. Where is Ted? Miss Lily in the living room with the chancellor. Sorry! It means nothing. Boy, Barney, stop with your abandonment issues. Ted has the right to have a life outside the group. As we all. No. No, silly. One day we all move forward in our lives. It's called growing up. I can not. I can not believe! I know. Maybe not. If being at home with a baby, tonight we have never seen a dead ringer for Ted. It would make you what, if we had missed it? Right, for his daughter's life. What do you say that? We agree that it makes no sense to have a child before he saw the five doubles, right? So when we finally see a dead ringer for Barney, this is the message of the universe to tell us to do. And at that time, we'll try. Deal?"

Boy, this gong is a relic of 500 years that has not been hit since WS Gilbert at the premiere of The Mikado in London in 1885. Great God, no! They belonged to Edgar Allan Poe! Where did your buddies?

1465,5,22,marshall ,"Robots vs. Wrestlers? No. Barney is right. It is impossible to deny that. Absolutely. A small road. But you can see. But you can see the exit sign. You should put yourself on track. Ted! It was our first post! It is popular. It was... a golf magazine for... Marissa Heller. A catalog of wicker furniture, also Marissa Heller. And a voucher for a bird shop... addressed to Marissa Heller... or check it out... ""Current Resident."" It's us! It has mail! It depends, on the invitation, it's about robots fighting wrestlers to rule the galaxy? I'm flattered but Lily should. She has beautiful teeth. It should not need the reminder cards to go to the dentist. I'm not dressed for it. You have nothing that resembles a mini cheeseburger? Mini pizzas? French fries? Something that makes me think I'm a giant? He will watch it. I know how to find it. Just a second... (They clap a gong) gongs, eh? Stronger than we think. It is the relic of his wife 500 years that has not been hit since WS Gilbert at the premiere of The Mikado in London in 1885. Can I talk for a second? Grave. We are going. It's time for Robots vs. Wrestlers. The best tradition of all time! You can not? The world is pretty cool right now. Babies. Holy shit! Dude, what's your thing with the breasts of my woman tonight? Do you really think about all this? For what it's worth, I think we are ready. We love, we are financially stable, and frankly, it would change that much the way we live. I blame the boy for the rest of his life. You're right. No need to rush. Sure, it goes without saying. Deal."
1466,5,22,robin ,"I'm sorry, Lily, but I have a chance to Don. And I will not drink out with you every night... especially when ""you"" included two of my ex. You too. I gotta go. It is called?

""Consider the race of which you are created not to live like brutes but to follow virtue and knowledge.""Or, in Italian original... Relax... It's for Marissa Heller. Fantastic! That must be the previous tenant. I wonder how it looks. And since, in every mail we receive, the picture becomes clearer. But we know not how it looks. I will follow it as always... An invitation to the annual Spring Jefferson Van Smoot, for Saturday night... in his apartment in Alberta! Friends... This is the most beautiful building in Manhattan! We gotta go! It's about an open bar. This building is fabulous! You saw the gate and terracotta panels outside? That's Marissa Heller. She is pretty. I'm on it. This lift uses the same mechanism from its installation in 1906. It seems that Lamar Louis Skolnick, the architect of the building, has cut the panels himself. And some French influence inside! He was an architect with a poet's soul, really. I must make a confession. It is not on the list, but I always wanted to see the inside of Alberta. Prem's. This is Peter Bogdanovich, talking to Arianna Huffington and Will Shortz, crossword editors of The New York Times! Try at least, Chow and alcohol free. 20 minutes and off we go. Sorry, you talk about the fourth book of madrigals? This is my favorite book of madrigals. You know who published an article on great Walt Whitman, and political semantics? Professor Hammersmith Oxford. Friends, Will Shortz, editors of the Times crossword. You know, I always say they use ""Ulee"" of Gold Life for vowels? Tell them. Ten letters, a diminutive egg pie? There. A great reception. I missed that glitch. I know, do not bother to say. There's no glitch in the wine. Look, I'm having fun here, so I'll pass Robots vs. Wrestlers. Actually, I like those pretentious snobs and they are not old fashioned fart noise when I open my mouth. I remain. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. You know, a reading of poetry. Citrus and honeycomb with a sharp acidity. This is a Sauvignon Blanc, Loire Valley. The town of Sancerre. Thank you, Will Shortz. Of course, hell is an interesting concept, is not it? I always liked to imagine it as Dante's Divine Comedy. If I may. Italian original... (Thinking...) I do not believe it. I recite the Divine Comedy in Italian original, and nobody makes fart noises. It's weird. I've never gone that far. I just seem to be an assh*le. My God, I control myself! Listen to me, I am completely let go! I'm the biggest assh*le on the planet. I wish someone stops me. I gotta run. Really? Because there is a poem I would recite... Friendship of Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Ted (2030): And that's how an image began to form. A picture of Marissa Heller, Marissa... the golfer Heller, one who loves the wicker... And Marissa Heller, ornithophilic. Ted (2030): The big night arrived. Our first stop... The building Alberta. Lily, holding Barney: No, no. It works. Marshall, laughing: Films... right? Actors. Willem Dafoe. Fun Fact of Willem Dafoe, his name sounds a bit like a frog, a parrot that talks. Willem Dafoe...! Willem Dafoe...! Ted (2030): And something extraordinary happened. Ted (2030): And someone did. Children, I told you that earlier this year, we met with duplicates of ourselves in the city. Robin There was a lesbian. There was the mustachioed Marshall. And, of course, Lily the stripper. That evening, another lookalike appeared... Ted Mexican wrestler. Ted (2030): Lily still loves to remind Marshall that said that. Ted (2030): Children, let me say that over the years, none of us got a little separated at one time or another. We do not want, but it happens.

Even the thing with nunchakus. Ted? To be clear, you're saying that you do not have boots red cowboy? I wanted... People want to know. Come on, darling, kiss him. This is outrageous. Thou hast embraced evil! Kiss it! This film is embraced anyway."

And when the van is gone, which shows up if it is not the owner of the apartment, which had just been robbed help. And that was hard to explain to the police. Do not change, baby. I find it pure. Pure. (Marshall gets up to the counter) Mashed mother of God is a moron sometimes. He lent them money to refuel. Not given, lent. They said they would send a check, so Marshall gave our address. What prevents them from coming home one night, and maybe tie me? With Marshall, sometimes we pretend for real but it's terrifying. What interest? He's from Minnesota. The mascot of his high school, it was a hug. Marshall is back with a beer while Ted joined them in turn. The Future Bride talking about you? Yes, nice and called Ted Mosby. It was cute. You're a good guy. Word expert. You must tell your story with Stella Royce. It will be released at one time or another. He looks like zero. You said ""not altogether, doll?"" Maybe North Korea?

No, you know, Ted is not screwed. You know why I'm nice? Because I'm crazy baggage people. Most people see another person with this big suitcase, and they spend doing nothing. But not me. I look at them and say, ""Hi, stranger. Can I help you? ""And you know who taught me to be like that? A Ted Mosby. A decent and sincere guy who has faith. And you know what, Ted?

Why would you tell her anything? What was with Royce? What's the movie about, anyway? Tony Grafanello? This is... Why would he make a film? It's not him, the villain? What idiot. He chose a beautiful girl for my role? What a jerk! A little cutesy. And a little cutesy. Because it is past the fifth most profitable films. I'll never see him out of friendship for you. Good luck.

A barber, a stripper and a pediatric psychiatrist..., walk into a bar. I love it. What? It was too much. I laugh, I cry. This is cinema, but it would not tell real people? It was so real! Why did you say ""Oh, no"" early in the film? It was not great the bride? It may come? Want to see it again? ""Good""? Rather perfect! The only thing, and for me it is a very small defect, compared to other films, is that I understand why Stella wants to marry a guy like Jed Mosley. Just the name of this guy: Jed Mosley... Who has not? It is a sacred number. A butterfly tattoo, how to pronounce this encyclopedia. I was so happy that this loser is done let go before the altar. You know why? Because he saw it coming. And the best part is that he will live a long, sad life, knowing he has lost his only chance of happiness. And when he gets beaten up by the goat? What a loser! Ted, you're okay? It was really bad, you should apologize. Ted? What do you mean? All I wanted was some pancakes this week. Bluntly, doll. Let me help you. It's not that important. Me too, I was let go before the altar. Three times. The last time, because I lost all our money at poker. That's why I live with my brother. Just the two of us. You'll see, he still pulls the duvet."

I feel it. I do not know what it is, but when I know, it'll be over. It's a good thing? Really? The last time I overcame a background, it was that of a certain Stella, and, damn, I draw a blank. How did it end? From grandmother. I would love that one bag of Royce or she is nice. It does not beat my pancakes. I'll make once. There are incredible. Interesting. We went to this new film The Future Bride. This is where it's interesting. It's about me. This is my story. It is written by Tony Grafanello. With him that Stella is gone. This film tells the story of our breakup. It's funny, it's also my recollection. But according to the film... Right? You're not in it. No, Tony is not stupid. Well, not after the movie. I'm bigger than him. Once. I was on medication! Nothing. This movie is really rotten! And everything is wrong!Remember my request? This spontaneous moment in the game room, I had no ring, so I gave him a teddy? That's how it was in the movie... And the hot date 2 minutes? When I condensed a romantic rendezvous in 2 minutes to go with the busy schedule of Stella? According to the film... But the worst... the worst... it was the end. They are to marry... So they are to marry... What is your problem? He said ""Ted"", right? Okay, he really said this time around. Nothing. Why? So why should it? I do not care. I will take it to my grave. It's a silly movie anyway! Yeah, that was good. Bluntly. Well, technically, this is the correct pronunciation. Bluntly! Bluntly! This guy's life was ruined by humiliation before the world. Too funny! It will take years before you can watch his family in front. It must be so traumatized that never again will he love or trust someone. It was insane! Get Moving, Adolf h*tler, a new king has arrived! I thought you would be interested to learn some stuff about this movie that you love. It is rotten. And you are all stupid to love. I know! I was so excited... How do you know it's his sentence? It's good. I will emigrate to a country where nobody saw the bride. I still am. I want to go get that girl. Because it is... Yeah, well... We had 3 rencards. It's nice. It's really nice! You're right, Marshall. I have to go retrieve it.And I know exactly where it is. Royce! Barney? I must say something. Long ago, I left that horrible daughter, Stella, break my heart. And now she is with this jerk who wrote a movie about it and this movie is called... The Future Bride. I'm Jed Mosley. But Royce, missed it... in that cowboy boots red, it's not me. What... They are burgundy in fact. I promised I'd make pancakes.And... I would keep that promise. Royce, if you... Do I always appreciate... Would you like me to make pancakes? That happened to me, it was pretty hard. I am not fully recovered. It feels good to have you said those things. I'm happy to open myself to you. Wait, I thought you had a very small studio. Yeah, you need to go there."

And I's wedding day, her ex, karate teacher, Tony Grafanello, showed up, he declared his love, Stella and fled with him, leaving me there, my heart completely broken. Ted (2030): That night, with Royce, I waited to see what would be his luggage. Ted (2030): I searched and searched, but apparently there was no luggage so I had to worry about, until we go see a movie. Ted (2030): This is where I realized that everyone has baggage, including me. Ted (2030): Children, you see more. Ted (2030): I was determined to make this film as far from me as possible. Unfortunately... Ted (2030): Barney did not say ""kiss"". Still not ""kiss"". Ted (2030): And like that, kids, my luggage no longer seemed so heavy. Everyone has his baggage, it's part of life.

But just like that, have a baby: big mistake. Now, show me. Yes, I understand. My colleagues are oddly on the fact that I work. I know, I know.

Marshall Eriksen... put a baby in my belly. We're going to say anything. If you tell them, they are invited in at the most private and intimate of our lives. We saw the fifth lookalike! I know. Say what you want about him, but Barney is better blonde. What? Yeah, seriously, Ted, you not discolor hair. The universe has spoken. Marshall Eriksen, make a baby. But we have seen, which means that the universe in its infinite wisdom, tell me of planting, and apply yourself. I know what's bothering you. The taxi driver looked like enough to Barney. It was smaller than Barney! And you know what? I think he was Asian. Yeah, this guy was a little Asian with a graying goatee and belly. What? Wait, you were aware? You lied to me? Baby, you... Finally. I know. It's weird, huh? What's your name? how Kristof? Barney, why are you doing this? Let me talk about him. He keeps saying that nobody should have children before 45 years. But I think I know what happens. Yesterday, Barney felt obliged to say goodbye to someone he really likes. And it made him think... A baby joining our group might not be the worst thing. And one day he will be the best uncle in the world. Because it Barney, he is part of our family. Yes! You're there! This is fantastic! The friends, follow me! (They leave) Look! The fifth double.

I called you, Barney. And we talked about! It was a recording? You called me Big Chief, my nickname special job. Come on. Stops. Why are you brown taxi driver? Sure. You're doing well in the Baltics. I think so. I must confess to Lily that the fifth lookalike is false. Lily decided that once you have seen all the doubles, we try to have children. I'm ready to be a father, you know? But Lily needs a sign of the universe. It could take years. Just to know, but it would do the same if we had not seen the Barney look-alike, eh? I can not. I can in good conscience you plant. Really?

Did you see the real Barney driving the taxi, and you thought it was a little Asian pot-bellied. It's not weird. That means you're not ready. Sorry for wanting to rush things. Our baby can expect the real dead ringer for Barney. Barney? It's just a guy we know who has a blog and really bad. This is something that was cool 8 years ago. Really? Your last name is ""Sosie""?

The executive producer of WNKW saw our show the other morning and I loved it. They offer me the position of presenter, starting next week. Yes, but here's the thing... WNKW is... Is Chicago. Why it happens now? While all was well with Don. This is the never ending battle of my life: career vs. love. I'm lost. What do I do? I'm too upset to talk with him. I have to avoid the time I decide what I want. You did a manicure? It gets no compliments. It may be that I moved to Chicago next week. It failed him. He had a manicure. I had a job offer in Chicago. Actually, I already made my decision. Friends, I must accept. So I was on the phone with Chicago. Yes, I made my decision. I appreciate the offer, but I can not accept it. Thank you. I'm staying. Hello Moo-Moo! Monty did you do an extra-fine pizza just as you love them! Are you okay? You said what? I'm going. I can. Good luck in Chicago, Don. Say yes to that. I can re-move?

Robin has something important to say. The other thing. The other thing. I can not believe that Robin is going to lose. And besides, it was a big mistake. I will re-stain the hair. Yes. Think of all of us, five years ago, when we met you.Marshall and Lily were friends as little. Today they are married and think about the children. And Barney? He would never get involved with anyone. And last year, he fell in love. And me? I was chasing a girl, convinced she was right. Today it is one of my best friends. And you? 5 years ago, you would never put love before your career, but now you did it. Just more courageous. We all looked for the 5 lookalikes.But eventually, over time, we all become our own doubles.These completely different people who look exactly like us. The ""Robin, there was 5 years""?

Marshall... the mustachioed Lily the stripper... and Mexican wrestler myself. Yes, mine was the coolest. And therefore, it was all anxious to find the lookalike fifth, that of Barney. It was more important to some than others. Ted (2030): And one day, a few weeks later... Robin, on TV: It just happened... is that Marshall Eriksen will say to his wife while trying to impregnate her. Helicopter 12 is live at the scene, with ""Baby Alert: 2010."" Marshall, thinking: Okay you two. We are in a delicate situation but very promising. Lily, thinking: If we play well the next minute, Ted goes to bleach their hair. Robin, thinking: This is wicked, can not... I just imagine. How do we do? Ted, thinking: What we all think? Nachos? Ted, thinking: I know. I really had for lunch. Marshall, thinking: Several people told him not to do something.Follow me. Ted (2030): The children, Robin and Don became such a duo, both outside and inside the screen, that Channel 12 asked them to lead others of their flagship programs. Ted (2030): Fun Fact: This episode had the highest ratings. Ted (2030): Oddly, this was not the biggest surprise of the day. Robin, on the phone: This is rather sudden. Of course, you will have an answer tomorrow. Okay. Thank you. (She hangs up and then remember) Ted, something big has just arrived and you're the most sensitive people I know. That I may see you. (At the hairdresser...) You know what, it can wait. Ted (2030): That night, Marshall returned to the news to Lily. Lily, thinking: Perhaps it's the depression talking, but Ted's hair beginning to be well? Marshall, thinking: Thank God, I thought I was the only one! Barney, thinking: Looks like a real movie star! Ted (2030): And here's how my hair bleached prevented us from doing anything that would have regretted. Children, the world is fun.

Only if you want to give this a stroke. We'll tell him about the baby when there's a baby to tell him about. Out for three months? No, we didn't. You know what, Marshall? Why don't you have a baby with your dad? What? Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right? Why not? That was really... Brief. Marshall? Here's the thing. You. You're like that. You and your dad both care so much. It's... it's why women fall in love with the Eriksen men to begin with. But right now, it's a lot of pressure. What if I can't have a baby? That could happen. I could totally let you down. Has that thought not occurred to you? Best man? You're being summoned."
1512,6,1,marshall ,"Stashed a cooler behind the pulpit. Beer be with you. Yeah. You're welcome, God. Nervous? Look at your beer, dude. You always do that when you're nervous. Okay, I'm almost ready to leave. Let's just go through the checklist. Candles? Music to set the mood? Music for when we're actually doing it? Nope! Hey! How was your day? Don't answer. No time. Bedroom. No, no. No time. Floor. No, no time. Against this wall! Yeah, it did. Well, that's a little weird, but yeah, it is. A bassinet? Oh, my... He must've made it in his wood shop. Wasn't that sweet of him? Lil? Isn't that sweet? Lily? Of course I did. I tell my dad everything. My dad is my best friend. We have been looking forward to this magical, special night for two weeks now. And, sweetie, during that time, I have been... How do I put this delicately? Saving all my love for you. Ah, no! Don't even touch me, dude. It's been, like... It's been two weeks. I'm, like, a light breeze away from having a big problem. Seriously. (He looks at Robin, picking her teeth) Okay, I'm better now. Lily! We kind of had a plan tonight, remember? Candles? Banjo? Shannon? Start the music... I may have mentioned it in passing to a couple of colleagues at work. I'm sorry about that, but you know what? I got to be able to tell my dad. Pickles would have helped that sandwich! Yeah, well, you know what? I've already told him, so the damage is done. Okay, so you just... You want me to give my dad a stroke? That's ridiculous. Lily, there is no way that I would ever... Okay, everyone needs to shut up so that I can think! Okay, so you just want me to call my dad and tell him that we're not having a baby? Okay, out of curiosity,when do we tell him about the baby? So, he just gets no notice? He just walks into his boss's office, and says, ""I just had a grandson. I'm gonna be out for three months."" Yeah. He and my mom are coming to live with us when the baby's born. We talked about this. I meant, me and my dad. Oh, okay, Lily.Why don't you have a baby with your butt? I can't think straight! Why do you have to wear that shirt? This is not how I thought this night was going to go! What? Lily, what? Are there more members of my family that you want to crap all over? I'm sorry. Hold on. Just... It's my dad. Lily, it's my dad, okay? I love him, and if he calls me, I'm gonna answer the phone! Hey, Dad. Dad, this is... Dad, I'm in the middle of something right now. He's insane. My dad is insane. I'm so sorry, Lily. He's just... He's so... enthusiastic. It's ridiculous, you know? Like, who's like that? Baby, I'm not trying to pressure you one bit. Not even for one second. Not having a baby would suck, but the idea of you letting me down... that's impossible. That would be like aliens landing. That's a bad example, because that could happen. It probably already has. I saw this, episode... All right. Dude, it's just a wedding toast. It will be. Ted, seriously, relax. Everything's... Okay, and it's raining. You didn't happen to bring an umbrella, did you? I mean, everyone told us that it might take a while, but... We thought we might be the exception to the rule. Anyways, we're getting back on that horse. I mean, feeling good about the future. Obviously, this goes without saying, but you won't tell Lily about any of this, right?"
1513,6,1,marshall's dad," Lily, Marvin Eriksen. I noticed you hadn't changed your last name yet.  So, don't worry. I called the DMV, I called your Amex, I got that process started for you.  Lily, Marvin Eriksen. I understand you and Marshall have been fighting. Well, let me tell you what works for me and the missus. Frilly French undies and a box of wine.  You might want to try pickles on that sandwich."
1514,6,1,marvin ,"Hey, hey. I know it's late, but I just had to call. How'd it go? Did you do everything the books say? Did you put the pillow under her back? Did it feel like a boy? You can tell."
1515,6,1,robin ,"Move. God! (She come over Ted and Barney's table) Hey. 'Sup, dudes? Fries? No fries for this guy. Thanks. Okay, about that. Ted, listen. I know myself pretty well. And, some time over the next few months, I'm going to want to sleep with you. And when that happens, you have to try to say no. Okay, you know, maybe I wasn't clear enough. I will come at you with everything I've got. I will stalk you like the lioness stalks the gazelle: careful, patient, deadly. And if you let your guard down for so much as a second, as sure as you were born, I will hump your brains out. Okay, I'm ready to have s*x now. No, we ran out of Cheetos last week. Oh, yeah, it's a Cheeto. Dibs. Mmm, totes, toots. She's here on a date. She brought the book because she got here early, and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting. Girls like to come across all classy and smart, you know? (She gets a giant hamburger out of a paper bag) So you went on one date with one of her friends. It's not necessarily a big deal. I mean, did it end on bad terms? Well, I guess you just got to move on. I mean, it's not like you have a shot with Ready McGee over there, right? Ted? You're one of those? God, I swear, one in five guys... They're talking to a guy now. Oh, a cheesy guy. Don't worry. Well, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy. Who's feeling nachos? Jealous? I have not lost it. I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want. I don't have to take this. But I do have to take this. 14 seconds! 14 seconds, and already some dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off. I... still... got... it. All right, buddy, you proved my point. Now scram. Nice belt, by the way. Oh, do I? Thanks. Say good-bye before you leave? Like I said, she's here on a date."
1516,6,1,ted ,"Nice! Where'd you get this? And also with you. Man, this is what church has been missing. Dude, you fixed church. What? No. I'm just hoping it doesn't rain. Why? Do I look nervous? Barney, I really... I have to grade these papers. A sun dress. I really have to get this done. Thank you. Okay, I'll tell you. Just... There's a... There's a girl sitting at the bar. Don't look! Okay, you can look. Just-just-just be cool for once. And what's that word? What... You can't call dibs on a girl I've been sitting here thinking about maybe talking to eventually at some point. Dibs were implied. Yeah. Look, I don't have time for a fake history lesson, so I'll keep this simple. You go over there and talk to that girl, I will see you in court. Damn it! You know what? To hell with your dibs. I'm going over there right now and talking to her. Actually, Marshall would probably be... No! I had implied dibs. Fine. Have at it. Exercise your dibs. She's got her shields up anyway. She's reading a book. You know what, Barney? Just cut her some slack, okay? She just went through a breakup. Here, have some tea. Robin, I am here for you. Whatever you need. Try? I will absolutely say no. Our friendship is too important. It was a tough summer, but I think our girl's been a real trooper. She's... Is this a Cheeto? Hey Robin, what do you think? The girl sitting at the bar. Shields up? Hey! How'd it go? You pregnant yet? I feel you, buddy. Okay, Barney. What's this going to cost me? Your dibs. I want to buy your dibs. 20 bucks. No. (He takes $20 out of his wallet) All right. Wish me luck. That girl she's talking to? I dated her. I got to see her ankles. What kind of guy? A cheesy guy or a cool guy? Oh, man! That guy is cool. His hair's all cool, he's got a cool belt. Oh, God, this sucks! Do you think she saw me? Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her. Or set me up with one of your friends. No, I'm kidding. That would be weird. It wouldn't, would it? Any one of those three. Whichever's easiest and right nearby. And not the beer. Totally. Her words exactly. She didn't see us high-six, did she? Yeah, let's never do that again. I'm doing this. I am going over there. Wish me luck. Okay, maybe I'm a little nervous. I know. I just... I want it to be great, you know? I want this whole day to be great. Geez, what now? Yeah. You were saying? No. I didn't bring an umbrella. No! Of course! Absolutely!"
1517,6,1,ted's wife," Tell me this isn't true.  (she slaps him in the face) You know, you've humiliated me! (turning towards Barney) I had no idea. You have to know that.  Or, you know, we could just do it right here."
1518,6,1,the man, Hi.
1519,6,1,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, there are two big days in any love story: the day you meet the girl of your dreams, and the day you marry her. Ted from 2030: Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily had recently decided to take a swing at starting a family. Tonight was their first at-bat. Ted from 2030: No, with Don. A few months earlier... Ted & Barney: Ohhh Ted from 2030: Now kids, remember how I told you about a girl named Cindy? [FLASHBACK - Cindy's appartment] How I went on one date with her and it ended... Ted from 2030: badly? Well... [END OF FLASHACK] The Girl who was reading: How are you? (to cindy) Ted from 2030: Then I remembered. Cindy had a roommate. A roommate I only caught a glimpse of... But a roommate who, by every indication, was something very special. Was it possible? Could this be the girl attached to that ankle? Ted from 2030: I braced myself for what was next: rage, fury, a possible shanking. Ted from 2030: Kids, nothing in this life quite compares to the sweet, terrifying exhilaration of making your move. When you just put it all on the line and go for it. And that night, by golly, Cindy went for it. So no, kids, that girl wasn't your mother. She ended up being someone else's mother. In fact, they both did. Ted from 2030: So that was not the day I met your mother. The day I met your mother was the day of a wedding."
1520,6,2,barney ,"So, this chick and I are going at it behind the Central Park Zoo. The Bonobo chimps start giving us a standing O, and just when I'm about to give her the same thing... What up?... I... I can't. I just... I can't. Guys, I know you count the minutes until you can escape from your humdrum lives by hearing how awesome mine is, and I love doing that for you, but I just can't tonight. I don't want to talk about it. All right, I'll tell you! My mother is selling the house I grew up in. All of my childhood memories gone, just like that! Anyway, I need you guys to come out to Staten Island on Saturday and help box everything up. Of course not. It's a two-day job. You guys are adorable. You seriously believe that I, Barney Stinson, can't talk you into this? I got the Queen to give me a fist bump. Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box. How dare you! Bro! Mom. Stop. Tuesday at work. Some of the senior partners are really getting up there. I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids. I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids. Hey. It's true. Tell him, James. Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this... ""Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10:00 in the morning, she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool. Love, Postmaster General. Thank you. Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine? Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth... Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class. Yeah, school girls... The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't... Who's Sam Gibbs? Mom addressed this and never sent it. Hey. (laughs) It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote... ""Your son."" I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom! Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker. So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy. ""Really rich""? For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop. Just... just give me a second, okay? Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really... you know. I'm not crazy. I just... I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up. Papa! Look at us!nIt's like three of the same guy. Oh, my God, this explains why I was always so awesome at basketball. Guys, I'm black! Sorry. African-American. No. I'm allowed to say either. I got to go get my camera! Here, Ted. Capture the moment! Man... I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about. Dad, look how fast I can run! Dad, you're not looking! Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I... I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top? Are you sure? What'd Coach say, Ma? Why didn't anyone come? It's okay, Mom. I don't need it. I already have a father. And his name... is Loretta. Wait. Dad! James! Where are you going? That's the best part. Can we go camping?"
1521,6,2,basketball coatch," I'm sorry, but your son can't be on the team. He's terrible."
1522,6,2,everyone ,James!
1523,6,2,james ,"Someone order something tall, dark and awesome? Hey! Mama. Check it. Huh? How cute is that, right? When was the last time you saw a diaper poking out of a Dolce and Gabana suit? Thank you guys so much for helping us out with this stuff. Oh, yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap. He would hit it from the outside, hit it from the inside... He sucked. Coach cut him from the team, and Mom fed him that story so he'd feel better. Constantly. I mean, she put more effort into some lies than others. No. No, no. I heard Flip Wilson, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Meadowlark Lemon... The list goes on. I still can't get a straight answer about who my real dad is. And Barney's no help. He still believes every lie that my mom told us growing up. Not me. I caught on early. Funny how all these girls have the exact same handwriting as the Postmaster General, Mom, and... home run king, Frank Aaron. No idea. Why? What's in it? Mom, who's Sam Gibbs? There's a picture of me and Barney in an envelope addressed to him. And you wrote ""your son"" on the back. If this picture was taken in North Dakota, then why is our old swing set in the background? Can you believe her? Listen to me. There is no Yourson, North Dakota. Mom... And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor. He might be one of our fathers. Barney! You... You've got to stop living in these fairy tales that Mom told us! Bob Barker is not your father. Sam Gibbs might be, but Bob Barker is absolutely, unequivocally not your father. This address isn't too far. Are you coming with me, or not? You're just too scared to face the truth. You're living in a dream world. You ready for this? I thought you said that he... Stop. Come here. Yeah... you're Sam Gibbs. I'm James Stinson, and, I think you may have known my mother, Loretta Stinson... in the '70s. My mother meant to send you this. That is my younger brother, Barney. He just thought he'd meet his real dad today, and clearly, he's not taking it so well. He's actually a really sweet guy, and he's great with my son. His name's Eli."
1524,6,2,lauretta ,"Oh, dear, I thought I told you, that's just not going to fit in there. Oh, my goodness! Look at my two sons. So big and strong and handsome. And how is my delicious little grandson? Oh, did he get the clothes I sent him?"
1525,6,2,lily ,"You expect us to spend a whole day packing up your mom's house? You may be able to talk the brain surgeons you pick up into doing whatever you want, but it's not gonna work on us. How did he do that? Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world? Well, she's not alone. Whenever Marshall was acting too hyper, his mom would suddenly decide he was ""sick"" and give him cough medicine until he passed out. And then there's the most popular parental lie in history. Santa. Santa's still a lie, and I'm not lying to our kids. Milk and lutefisk? Santa doesn't get cookies in Minnesota? I'm not lying to our kids. Not now. Oh, what's done is done. God, this must be so hard for Barney. Don't worry. We'll... We'll snap Barney out of this when he gets back. Are you kidding?"
1526,6,2,loretta ,"Oh, I don't know... That guy. Okay, everyone, lunch is ready. Who wants Sloppy Joes? That doesn't sound familiar. Who wants Sloppy Joes? Oh, no, that... It says ""Yourson."" For Yourson, North Dakota. That's where we took the picture. Lovely town. We went kayaking, and you two rescued the mayor's dog, which had wandered into the rapids. That mayor, Sam Gibbs, asked for your picture so the city could make statues of you both. I guess I never sent it. That's embarrassing. Now, how about those Sloppy Joes? I don't know! I did my best as a single parent, and it wasn't always easy, and I'd recommend putting the coleslaw right on top of the Sloppy Joe, because it's delicious that way! Barney? I need to talk to you. Listen... I always wanted to be enough for you boys. I think that's why it always hurt whenever you asked about your dads, because I was always trying so hard to be both parents for you. But I was being selfish. You deserve the truth. So here it is. Sam is not your father. Yes. He's black, dear. But if you want, I can tell you who your father really is. He said you're simply too good to be on the team. It's not fair to the other boys. But that's okay. We can just play together in the backyard. Oh, you know what, dear? Apparently, there was a mix-up with the mail. I just got this letter from the Postmaster General. ""Dear Barney, I sincerely apologize ""for losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party."" Barney. But it's your father."
1527,6,2,marshall ,"What are you talking about? Your mother still lives in the house you grew up in. Unsubscribe. That sounds plausible. Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot? I'm pretty sure that's what stunted my growth. I hit 6'4"" in the fifth grade, and then I just stopped. Yeah, but that's a good lie. Like when we tell Ted he'll meet the right girl and settle down. You will meet her, buddy. Yeah! Baby, it's Santa. Don't you want our kids going to sleep on Christmas Eve with their hearts full of hope, their heads full of crazy cough syrup nightmares, knowing that downstairs Kris Kringle is stuffing their stockings full of joy and stuffing his belly full of milk and lutefisk that they left him? Yeah, that's just what Santa needs at 3:00 a.m. when he's battling a snowstorm over the Rockies: a sugar crash. No. Santa needs protein. I suppose you have a problem with the Easter Bunny, too. Maybe we shouldn't have brought these Sloppy Joes. Yeah, but you know what? He took a big step today... Or, he could just let him have this one. Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home, he finally admitted Bob Barker's not his dad, and then he watched James meet his real father. It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon. Can't we just let the guy be black for a day?"
1528,6,2,robin ,"What's wrong? Okay. Hey, you guys see Deadliest Catch last night? Pass. So, Ted, yesterday at work, I totally talked you up to that super-hot makeup girl, Liz. Oh, you know, how funny you are... Handsome. Incredible lover. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I was all like, ""He knows a woman's body better than she knows her own, endless waves of pleasure just cresting and breaking for hours and hours..."" Blah, blah, blah. ""Orgasms so intense that you just black out."" All that stuff. What? You know what you're doing down there. Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it. We know this. Maybe I did oversell you a bit. Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too? So, Ted? You were worried that I oversold you to Liz. Well, I fixed it. I sent her another email. ""Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound like I was trying to oversell Ted. The truth is, he is a genuinely nice, down to earth guy, and I think you two would really hit it off."" ""Is he going to rock your world in bed? No. But he's clean, open to criticism, and not into anything too weird. He's not bad at all. Not bad at all."" ""I'll be honest. The first few times aren't going to be that great. He's going to say 'Are you finished?' more times than a waiter in a busy restaurant."" Why don't I just go to the Chevy Web site and copy down adjectives? How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out? ""Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, and really rich, but lacks bladder control."" Oh, damn. That last bump just made me hit send. Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke. He's also quite the detective. Weird day. Hey, look at that! Liz still wants to meet you. That's great! Maybe a little. I did not specify on what scale. She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear."
1529,6,2,sam ,"Loretta! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I... I knew Loretta. You're my son. Oh, my head's kind of spinning, too. I mean, Loretta and I only saw each other for a couple of months. You were two before I even knew you existed, and at that point, your mother made it very clear she was going to raise you on her own. I felt I had to respect her wishes, but I always wanted to meet you. Come on. You know this. Come on. There you go. Come on. I have a grandson? He's beautiful."
1530,6,2,sam gibbs, Can I help you?  Yes.
1531,6,2,ted ,"Did I ever! Deadliest Catch ever! That sucks. I've been there, buddy. With her new hippie husband, Clint. The comfort of home is a little ruined when someone turns your old room into what I'm pretty sure is a Tantric s*x temple. With all the bamboo, pot smoke and '60s music, it's like my old G.I. Joes are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback. Same. No one believes that story. Yeah, that's what your mom said. No, she actually said that. How you doing? Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. What did you say? Guilty. Who, me? Really? Robin, how can I possibly live up to that review? But that is not the point. I mean, you broke the first rule of setting people up: undersell. It's like, if someone's never seen The Karate Kid, you don't say, ""It's the greatest movie ever."" You say, ""Uh, it's pretty good"" And then they see it, it blows their freakin' mind. Because Cobra Kai sensei's all like, ""Sweep the leg!"" And Daniel-san's all like... (high-pitched vocalizations, (mitates whooshing sounds) Damn. Loretta really lied a lot to her kids. I always find that reassuring. You think so? How? Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect. That totally takes the pressure... See, now you went too far in the other... Stop! ""Ted Mosby is solid as a rock."" No. ""Dependable."" No. ""Rugged."" No. I just want to hit that perfect middle ground. What? Oh, no. No, they won't. They're going to think... Wait. ""Everyone""? Wait. Barney and James are two years apart. If Sam only knew Loretta for a few months, he couldn't possibly be Barney's father. What? I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl. Weird day. I guess. Wait a minute. You said Liz was a total ten. Why would she want to meet the incontinent freak show you described? You oversold her! You said she was a ten. You said she looked like a movie star."
1532,6,2,,"Ted from 2030: So there we were helping Barney pack up his childhood home. Ted from 2030: During that afternoon, Sam and James began to discover how much they had in common. Ted from 2030: Eventually, the strangest afternoon of our lives wound to a close, and we headed back to Staten Island, where Barney and his mom had a long overdue heart-to-heart. Ted from 2030: And at that moment, Barney suddenly saw his childhood more clearly than he ever had before. Ted from 2030: Kids, your uncle Barney grew up without a dad. And it always made him feel incomplete. But as he hugged Loretta, surrounded by the boxes into his happy childhood, he realized he had one hell of a mom."
1533,6,3,barney ,"Ted, look across the bar. Three chicks: one hot, one kind of hot and one who I'm assuming is really funny. We ride! What's wrong? Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again. Hi. Barney Stinson. Thank you for your time. Fine. I'll have a three-way with hot and kind of hot while Giggles works the camera. I ride! Look, I didn't get shot down. Trust me, I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. This is all part of the plan. After initial contact, I'm now in the ignoring phase. Golden rule: I do not buy dinner to get the yes. Dinner's a very intimate activity. It requires a level of connection and eye contact that s*x just doesn't. Call me old-fashioned, but I need to have s*x with a girl at least three times before I'll even consider having dinner with her. No, you pent-up old perv. I brought you a present. Recognize this? Do you remember how awesome it was to be co-workers... Nay, bro-workers? Ted Mosby, it's back on. We're gonna build your building. Of course not. I need another drink. Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. Chrissy, I love your glasses. They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy. Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community. You stick with it. To Ted. Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks! (...) Man, the courtside Knicks seats that are available to all upper level GNB employees are too close to the action. I keep getting sweat on my suit. It sucks! (...) Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks! So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers? That is so true. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you? Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else. What? Ted, it's too late. Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank... Dude! You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here. We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job. 236. Come on, Ted! This is your dream. Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class? You son of a bitch. I'll call Marshall. We'll draw up the contract."

1536,6,3,lily ,"Where's the poop, Robin? When I was a kid, I had a dog named Bean. Whenever he made the face that you're making right now, you just knew he pooped somewhere in the house. Where's the poop, Robin? Where's the poop, Robin? Where's the poop? Good for you. Where's the poop, Robin? Give me your phone. We're deleting Don's number. Prove it. Delete contact. Barney, why can't you just take a girl out to dinner like a normal person? But designing a building in New York City is your lifelong dream. Don't ""Hey, Lily"" me. I smelled poop all the way from the hallway. Where's the poop, Robin? But that's impossible. You deleted his number. I know, sweetie. I know. Delete it! My ""plezh."" If you can find a number in there that I don't call regularly, I'll gladly delete it. No, not that one. That's my dojo. I took an introductory karate class. Ops, wrong room. Where do the grown-ups go for the real karate class? Of you? Please. I'm a kindergarten teacher. But I'm totally gonna sign up for more lessons. I don't know. It was around the time when everyone was going, ""Wassuuuuuuup!"" I might. No, it's not. Okay, you know what? There, gone. Your move, Scherbatsky. Oh, that sucks. Although I like you two together. You're loving this. You are. You're loving the attention. Robin never deleted Don's number. Probably not, baby. Okay. Your turn. Where's the poop, Robin? Where's the poop, Robin? I thought you deleted his number. Well, you have to try. If you ever want to have closure... Hey, punk! Bit of advice. Next time you step on a kindergarten teacher's neck, you better finish the job."
1537,6,3,man ,I knew this day would come.
1538,6,3,marshall ,"Bro, I told you, if you ever need a wingman, I'm your guy. And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman. Back already. How was flying solo? And by ""solo,"" I mean so low that you got shot down. This is awesome... You're designing our new headquarters. Now, there will be voices that tell you a hockey rink on the roof is unfeasible. You've got to shut those voices out. Dude, none taken. Yes, GNB is, the Empire from Star Wars. But the Death Star's gonna get built either way. And don't you think the architect of the Death Star is pretty psyched to have that thing on his space resume? I mean, yes, his design was flawed in the sense that a single bullet fired into a particular vent would explode the whole thing. But that won't happen on your watch... you know why? Because you're Ted Mosby! And you are gonna design the most beautiful, ventless, Rebel-proof building in Manhattan, with clearly marked emergency stops for every trash compactor on the detention level. No, I'm fine. Wait, you turned down the job? When? That's so weird. Just, like, an hour ago, when we were leaving work... So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job? Exactly. I mean, it's almost like he's putting the moves on you. I hope that's his end game. Actually, I don't. I like you two together. Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl? The backhanded compliment to lower her self-esteem... a proven winner. No! Barney's been ""putting the moves"" on Ted. No, he's been doing it to try to get Ted to design the new GNB Tower. Okay. No problem. If you can find a number that I don't need or shouldn't have in here, be my guest, but good luck. I keep my phone tight. Oh, no, not that one. That's the booker for the club that my band plays at. You know, my all-lawyer funk band... you remember... The Funk, the Whole Funk and Nothing but the Funk. No, no, we're gonna... we're gonna play another gig again. Probably really soon. It's just we all got super busy, and... We're not going to play another gig again, are we? Well, it's just that without that number in my phone, I'm just a corporate lawyer working 60 very un-funky hours a week. It's not a move, dude. I executed the paperwork for the new architect this morning. Barney wasn't lying. It's not a move, dude. The senior partners were getting impatient. I thought you didn't even want the job. Okay, it's a move. There is no other architect. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied. I was being Barney's wingman, and I never get to be the wingman. I can do better. Take me back. You son of a bitch! No... Ted... you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me. I think that's just called a dog."
1539,6,3,rachel ,Why aren't you in class?
1540,6,3,robin ,"So, get this: Last night, I was watching TV, and it turns out, some random satellite channel picks up a certain local Chicago newscast. Well, I'll admit, at first, I felt a little weird. But after the initial shock, I realized something: I've moved on. Finished with that. It was a peaceful moment of closure. Yeah, thank you. Excuse me? Hey, Don, here's some breaking news: there's a zit breaking ou on your forehead. Finished with that. Look, I'm not proud, but Don left so quickly that I never got the chance to have that final showdown. So yelling at him, even on TV, felt kind of good. And you know what? Now I truly am over him. Thank you. Damn it! Okay, in the process of truly getting over him, I may have called him and left an... indelicate voice mail. I am gonna k*ll you. I'm gonna fly to Chicago, k*ll you, put your stupid face on a deep dish pizza and eat it. And then maybe catch a Bears game. But mostly the k*ll*ing and eating your face thing. Don't worry. I am never doing that again. It was a one-time thing. There. Deleted. No? Are you kidding me? Hey, Lily! Oh, no, not this again. Okay, I left Don another message. ""This just in"" is what I'm gonna say when I'm stabbing you. I tried to. But then this thing popped up on my phone that said, ""Are you sure?"" And I wasn't sure. I can't lie to my phone. It's not that easy, okay? You're not just deleting a number, you're deleting a part of your life. You know, all those memories, all those experiences. It's like you're admitting they're gone forever. Okay, if it's that easy, I'm gonna delete one of your numbers from your phone, see how you like it. Super Kicks Karate. You have a dojo? How long ago did you take that class? How do you even remember that? Lily, this is a number that you will never dial again. No, no. But you keep it in your phone because it reminds you of a version of yourself that you could be, even if it's a version of yourself that you'll never become. And that's okay. For the last time, I don't care how big it was, it is not the same as giving birth. Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint? And the intense eye contact thing? And the thing where he establishs intimacy through physical contact? So at any point in this did you say, ""Barney, I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. I am not taking that job""? Oh, Teddy, you are so going to spread your legs and design that building. Oh, everyone thinks it's so easy. Give me your phone. Let's delete one of yours. Edwin. You guys played one gig four years ago. I'm deleting it. See, it's hard to hit that delete button, isn't it? Sorry, Marshall. But if I have to, you have to. Hey, guys. How do you do that? You are like a bomb-sniffing dog, except with poop. You are a poop-sniffing dog. Fine. I called Don again. Hey, Don! It's Robin again. Look, I am sorry for all the calls. It's just, I saw you on the news, and it made me a little crazy for a minute. I guess I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought. But I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to k*ll you. No... No, I'm not. I am happy for you. And that Asian slut on your Facebook page. She's dead, too. I did, but it turns out, I memorized it. You can't delete contacts from your brain, Lily. I am never going to have closure. Okay? Closure doesn't exist. Okay, one day, Don and I are moving in together, and the next thing I know, he's on a plane to Chicago. It just... ended. And no matter how much I try to forget that it happened, it will have never not happened. Don and I will always be a loose end. We'll always be... Who is this? I'm sorry. Is this 917-456... I'm sorry, 465... No, wait. Sorry. Wrong number. Finished with that."
1541,6,3,ted ,"Unfinished. Of all the words you could use to describe La Sagrada Familia... Brown, pointy, weird... The one that really seems to stick is ""unfinished."" Why? Because on June 7, 1926, the architect Antoni Gaudi... Whose beard was also brown, pointy, weird and unfinished......was run over by a bus. And so, his greatest masterpiece would remain forever... I don't know. Got a burger coming. Oh, man, it's bad enough to have to go through a horrible breakup, but then have that person pop up on your TV? Are you okay? That's great. Good for you. That's great. What are you doing here? Oh, God! You're dating one of my students. It's Rachel, isn't it? Barney, I know she wears provocative sweaters, but she's 19! Now I'm gonna have to hear all about it, right? Go on, tell me every detail. It's my building. Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean... Actually, I think I'm gonna say no. I do not want to work for GNB again. Those guys are evil. No offense, Marshall. For all we know, that was the contractor's fault. Look, I know this is hard to understand, but right now, I have a quiet, simple, happy little life. And I like it that way. I know what my answer has to be. I can't take the job, Barney. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings? All right. I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Barney, back me up. Barney. Dude, this is important. Marshall, you want anything? Okay, I get that he's mad at me for turning down the job, but acting like I'm not even here? This morning. Am I wrong or is that exactly what Barney says when he's putting the moves on a girl? Yeah, more like the opposite. He's been ignoring me all night. Barney wants me to take the job so bad he's putting the moves on me? I don't buy it. That's crazy, even for Barney. But Barney hasn't done... I finally know what your kind goes through. I get it now. He did. Okay. Yep. You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese. Yeah... Cream cheese has a mild flav-flavor so it... it balances out the spiciness of the jal... the spiciness of the... Dude! Well, I mean, not exactly in those... No. It's nice to be wanted, okay? And, yes, this is a new vest. Thank you all for noticing. Oh, that's right, you didn't. Barney did! I am not that kind of architect. So get this... Barney, I gotta tell you something. Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower. Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, ""pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more."" It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, ""Oh, God, I never should have said no."" Oh, God, I never should have said no! Come on, GNB didn't really hire a new architect. This is just one of Barney's moves. I didn't! I don't! I don't. I don't! Okay, I'll do it! I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff. What? You guys lied to me? Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me. No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women... No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no. Unfinished. Gaudi, to his credit, never gave up on his dream, but that's not usually how it goes. I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy, weird church from getting built. Most of the time, it's just too difficult or too expensive, or too scary. It's only once you've stopped that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it. But it's always there. And until you finish it, it will always be... Hey, Barney. Hey, Rachel. Rachel, why aren't you in class? Not so fast. I'm not that easy."

Ted from 2030: But first, let's back up a few days. Robin:I don't know what you're talking about. Robin:There's no poop. Robin:Okay. So it wasn't entirely a peaceful moment of closure. Ted from 2030: The next day, at the university, I had a surprise visitor. Ted from 2030: Kids, you may remember that, a few years earlier, I was chosen to design the new Manhattan headquarters for Goliath National Bank. It was the opportunity every architect dreams about. And when the project was ultimately scrapped... it broke my heart. Ted from 2030: And I thought that was the end of the story. But then that night... Lily:Oh, sweetie, I totally understand. Delete it! Ted:...before me fell for. Wow, respect. Ted from 2030: And so I made Barney break his golden rule. I made him take me out to dinner before I finally gave him the thing he always got. Yes. And even though it didn't happen right away... Ted from 2030: Robin finally got some closure, too."

Every time I take the bus, there is one crazy person no one wants to sit near. That's why I have never taken the bus. Plus... I can run faster than a bus. You're all wrong... I got a way to get there so fast, I could beat all of you, even if I sat down and ordered a big, juicy steak first. Medium rare. But that's not important right now.

Hey, toots! How about a ride? Oh. Hey, Robin, it's you. I'm sorry. I never apologize. And why would I? Sure. Stand a little more this way. I'm scouting some talent. Pretend we're talking about something important. Oh, you know what? That's just getting distracting. Um, say ""carrots and peas"". Carrots and peas. Guys, I can't stop staring at that girl's face. What, you really had something to talk about? Robin, I had no idea. No, don't stop the car. Look, you... Wait, wait... Robin, hold on. If you want to talk, I'm right here. Don't... You... Faster. Mush! Mush! I need this win. I need this win. And firing half my department freed up the money to double my own salary. And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group. And I smell incredible. Smell me. Just, seriously, smell me. Stop! Too slow. Switch. Who cares? No! How did that even happen? No! Yeah. Check it. I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks, and I still smell incredible. Smell me.

My body has been letting me down, and I just wanted to prove that it could still do something, but it can't. Well, you should talk. You know, you're the one who's freaking out because you have one mediocre review and, like, 50 great ones. And you're designing a frickin' building. I mean, come on, dude. No. Lily, what the hell is the matter with you? Oh, baby, you were also going to run over Ted. Maybe for the same reason that I kept saying that I could run seven miles. I... I'm trying to be really, um, confident and positive about all this, but, baby, I'm really scared that we're not pregnant yet. I keep thinking there's something wrong with me. We are crazy. This is the last time it's ever going to be just the two of us. Shouldn't we be enjoying that? And take ballroom dancing. And see Coney Island. I've still never been.

Dude, that's, like, seven miles. You can't do that. You can't beat the bus! All right, all right, hold on, hold on! Let's just forget about it. Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway. First person there wins! (Everyone stand up et run outside)Doesn't matter how you get there! Grademyteacher.net? Here's a fun fact. See the Alberta Building over there? That's the gray one. Did you know that in 18... Well, you're in luck. See that gothic church over there? Those corinthian columns were designed by Giuseppe Pegatto in 1896. (the woman stands up to find another place) See that over there? That's the old Arcadian Hotel. Fun fact... While today its neoclassical fenestration is considered to be... (the driver suddenly pulls the breaks) Uses a hybrid steel tube structure... Okay, this is clearly a sign. Let's just call it a tie. Forget about the race. Head back to the bar. And not a single passenger would listen to me. I mean, am I a bad teacher? Do I just put people to sleep? Wait.

Ted from 2030: As the weeks went by, Marshall's confidence never wavered. Then it started to mess with Lily's head. Ted from 2030: Lily was so fed up with not getting anywhere, maybe winning this race was just what she needed. Ted from 2030: Kids, I also needed a win that day. A couple nights earlier, your Uncle Marshall had offhandedly mentioned a web site called... Ted from 2030: A couple nights earlier, your Uncle Marshall had offhandedly mentioned a web site called... Ted from 2030: I just had to see what my students had written about me. And it was... Majestic. Until... Ted from 2030: Now, kids, I knew I was a good Professor. That's why I didn't let it bother me. I had nothing to prove. Absolutely nothing. Ted from 2030: Robin also needed a win that day. Ted from 2030: It had been a rough year for Robin. First her boyfriend and former cohost, Don, left her for another job. Then Robin met her new cohost, Becky. Ted from 2030: And just like that, Becky started to eclipse Robin. I mean, literally eclipse her. Ted from 2030: Kids, that day, I had a horrible realization. If you can't spot the crazy person on the bus...It's you. (Ted steps out of the bus) The good news is, I was halfway there, and nothing could stop me. Ted from 2030: Just like that, the race was back on. Ted from 2030: Meanwhile, one subway car over... Ted from 2030: Actually, Barney did not need a win. Ted from 2030:He did smell incredible. Man, in a calculator display: Buddy? Hey, buddy? Need a hand? Ted from 2030: Here's how it happened. Ted from 2030: As for how Robin beat me and Barney, to this day, your uncle Barney won't admit it... Who cares? But here's what I saw: I saw Barney notice Robin's face... And maybe realize something. Barney says he tripped, but it sure felt like he tackled me on purpose. And when Robin won, I could have sworn I saw him smile. Ted from 2030: He did smell incredible. Ted from 2030: Technically, there was only one winner that day. And in that race, everyone found exactly what they needed. It's true, she wouldn't see Woody Allen for another couple months, but that's how Robin became, by just about any definition of the term... A real New Yorker."
1563,6,5,barney ,"Sick. Yeah. Dude. Working together is gonna be legen... Wait for it. I'll send you an inter-office memo with the rest 'cause we freakin' work together! Oh, big news. The board finally settled on a site for the building. Sure. What's up? Not now, Trish! Legendary! So, what's on your mind? You're kidding me. Snakes. I don't recall saying ""snakes"". Ted, I know you love crappy old stuff no one cares about. But I'm gonna give you four words to live by: New is always better. You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better. Everything. Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law. Axl's really matured as a songwriter, Ted. A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch sounds lovely. Lots of ice. New is always better, Ted! That's a rule. Just like bigger is always better! How can you speak of such things? How can you speak of such things? I do not do that. Boobs? Damn it. But... seriously. Boobs? Speaking of disappointing weenies... Ted, tell them what you told me. I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin... Wait a minute. Who's the girl? Boobs? Whose dream? Oh, Ted, that's so romantic. I want to fill a pillowcase with dead batteries and beat you with it. And you said...? Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs? And what did this ""Zoey"" say when she found out that you're the one tearing down her beloved Arcadian? That you, Ted Mosby, are the Architect Of Destruction? This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl. Asian girls love them some Jews. No. Technically, they were eggs. I don't recall saying ""eggs."" Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?! Momentary grudging respect. Ted, that is never gonna happen. Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door. I had to. Now that you have no shot with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal. Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump! Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail. You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her. The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building. Dude, you can do whatever you want with it. So you're back in?"
1564,6,5,barney's secretary," Excuse me, Mr. Stinson.  But there's an urgent memo for Mr. Mosby."
1565,6,5,lily ,"Oh, baby. No, no. Not the slipper socks with the rubber soles. I work so hard to-to set the mood, and-and when I see those, I feel the egg go right back up my Fallopian tube. Traction? Please stop calling yourself ""Papa."" Hey, so I talked to Robin. I guess she and Max hooked up last night. Yeah. He's a sweet guy. She feels really comfortable with him. They bonded over hockey. I guess he has a small pen1s, but they want to double-date next weekend. So you'll clear your schedule. Oh, the small pen1s thing? That's insane. I mean, just because you know Max has a small pen1s... Max has a small pen1s. Size, shape, left or right leaning orientation... You're kidding. Barney, every time I mention a woman you don't know, the first thing you say is, ""Boobs?"" Not the complete sentence, ""Does she have big boobs?"" Which also would not be great. Just: ""Boobs?"" My friend Lori from work... So why is it okay for guys to talk about boobs, but the moment we bring up a topic like Max's small pen1s... I'm gonna pretend this conversation never happened. Um, I think you got that backwards there, Chief. Damn, baby, be cool! Are you suggesting that guys don't talk about s*x? Oh, nothing. We don't talk about you! Ugh, he thinks I like this...But it feels disgusting. ""Uh, is this working for you?"" Oh, you're bad. Oh, I've had that a couple times. Just lean into it and let it fuel things. Then he gets this panicked look on his face, says, ""I can't do this,"" and storms out. But here's the crazier part. It was amazing. He was passionate, animalistic, a complete stud. Yup. ""'You're like a Greek god, I moaned, as the..."" I can't read that, baby. ""As the musky scent of man and Marshall's sure-footed traction intoxicated and overpowered me."""
1566,6,5,man ,"Oh, bummer! Dude, why are you dressed like a wizard?"
1567,6,5,marshall ,"Oh, yeah. Baby, these satin sheets are slippery. Papa needs traction. As you know, Papa likes to get down with enthusiasm. And without traction, Papa's likely to boogie himself right out of bed. It's either these or soccer cleats. Nice! I love that guy. Max is both his name and his level of awesomeness. Why would you tell me that? No! The other part! Ah! Don't! Stop saying that! Why do you keep saying that? You... I don't want to know that. I'm not going to be able to look the guy in the eye. I'm certainly not going to be able to call him ""Max."" Just don't! Pff. That's not true. Uh, sometimes smaller is better. ""Hey, look how big my cell phone is!"" You don't hear people say that. No. You want something compact and efficient that fits comfortably in your pocket, and I think Max is just a great guy. Impossible. Max's pen1s is stuck in my brain like a splinter. Like a splinter-sized splinter. Whoa! Sweet wrestling name alert. And you're welcome. Hey, hey. I bet it's not that small. Yeah, but, uh, you know what they say. The important thing is-is how you use it, you know? ""The motion of the ocean."" That whole thing. I'm just saying that I bet it's bigger than he thinks. And thick. Well, spare no expense, buddy. Dinner is on me, and-and get dessert. Maybe this molten chocolate lava cake? I just want you to be happy. We'll just be here. (He gives a hug to Max)You're great. I know. It's your fault! You ladies and your salty sailor talk! Locker room talk. Do you want to know what it's like in a men's locker room? It's just a bunch of uncomfortable dudes trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. And one old guy just letting it all hang out. Yes, we do, but you know what we say? ""I hit that.""""I got some.""""I tapped it."" ""I squeezed those."" Discreet and efficient. Thank God that I'm not dating. If I thought that Lily talked in that much detail about our s*x life, I'd probably k*ll myself. Oh, no. What did you tell her? Are you sure? Uh, is this working for you? I can't... I can't do this! I can't stop thinking about you and Robin! Look, no. You know what? Why don't you just... Why don't you just call Robin, okay, and have a good laugh about it? Whoa! Traction could have prevented that. No. You know what? Papa don't back down from a fight. So why don't you tell Robin... about this! ""Musky scent of man."" How's it going with Robin? Really? Why? You with her? Guys, come on. What is it? I... What do you think it was, Murray?"
1568,6,5,max ,"So I walk into my boss's office and suddenly I realize, ""Holy crap, I'm about to quit"""" Well, right now it's a pretty small practice. Bro, it's... pretty small. Nah. Everything about it is tiny. The office is tiny. The conference room is tiny. Plus, I got a very small staff. Well, I know what I'm getting.Oh? Oh?The porterhouse. I've had it here before. It is like this. It's huge. Thanks, man. Next time, it is on me. Aw. Excuse me. I'll be right back. All right. Ah. Thanks, bro. It's, uh.... it's going on a while. Thanks. Uh, I think I have to break up with her. Yeah, well, there's this... kind of weird thing she likes to do in the bedroom. Come on, bro. This is a locker room."
1569,6,5,robin ,"Lily told you. Girls talk about everything. Length, resemblance to a historical figure, such as Winston Churchill... Yes, that's one of you. Girth, grooming... Duh. Of course there's a girl. Yeah, I-I think it is so cool that you started your own law firm. He said it's small, Marshall, and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on. Let's order! Totally. You're acting like he has six months to live. Oh, come on! What about you men and your locker room talk? Not to mention classy. Yeah. That argument has no traction whatsoever. Uh, it looks disgusting. Oh, of course, because what woman doesn't like being slobbered on while some giant paws at her nether regions like Lenny from Of Mice and Men? More Cosmos? Wow, that is weird. Wow. So he's right there making you say all this, huh? That sounds real."
1570,6,5,ted ,"I love your idea about a giant rooftop ring of fire you can jump through with a motorcycle, but I tweaked it slightly and... This is still super bad-ass. It's now a patio garden where you can bring a nice bag lunch. Uh, no, thank you. Still got it. Barney, we have to talk. ""Dary."" I can't design the building. I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave? Did you just say ""snakes""? New is always better? Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything? So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones? And when you're at a g*ns n' Roses concert, you're like, ""Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy""? Wendy! I'd like to buy my friend a drink. What's your oldest Scotch? Amazing. And what's your newest scotch? Your call, buddy. Told him what? I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building. What? I... There's no g-girl. Why would you even... Her name is Zoey. Look, mister, you are very convincing, and I am very flattered. Confused, even. But I'm not looking... Not only is she funny, hot and genetically female, but get this... She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream! We wound up talking for hours. Old is always better. I can't wait to be old. You can shoplift and pretend you're just confused. Well, I'd say you got a pretty long wait. Anything. Where do I sign? This isn't about the girl. It's about the building. Well... Uh, it's a... it's a funny thing about that... I'm a veterinarian. What? I panicked! I don't do that. Well, off to meet Steph. We're adrenaline junkies! [...]Penelope is taking me to the Battle of Gettysburg. We're gonna eat squirrel! [...] (Ted enters the living room, dressed up as a wizard) Look, she's really hot, okay? Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid. And Marshall never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily. The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian? Did you just say ""eggs""? Zoey... I'm Batman. Hmm. That'd be cool. Wasn't expecting bunnies. Absolutely. Just let me run up and get my bag of vet supplies. Okay. Why would I say that? You just broke in and stole these guys? Aren't you worried about getting arrested? Wow. You're a little bit crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Although I hear there's a lovely rooftop patio where folks can enjoy a nice bag lunch, so... Solid C-cup, perky bounce. Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building. Well, I can't tear down The Arcadian. I'm sorry, but I'm off the project. Hey. Well, you really got to me the other night. I want to get involved with ""Save The Arcadian."" She was really hot, okay? How the hell could you do that? The billboard, Barney. You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting. Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?! You named the rabbit? You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want. Yeah. Well, that explains a few voicemails. Listen, Zoey, I think we can save The Arcadian. No. Maybe not in the way you were picturing, but I stayed up all night working on a new concept, all right? What if my design could incorporate The Arcadian's facade into the new GNB headquarters? Are you married? This isn't about the girl. It's about the building. Yeah, it was about the girl. This wouldn't work. Zoey, The Arcadian was a really great building once, but it's falling apart, and it's full of snakes. I don't recall saying snakes. Hey, what's not for everyone?"

1572,6,5,woman ,"Beautiful building, right? I'm not a drag queen. But you definitely have me rethinking this eye shadow. Look at the Palladian windows, the rusticated stonework, the marble cornices... I love how old parts of the city are. Hmm. It makes me feel connected to history. Me, too. You can wear elastic everything. Your lipstick doesn't have to stay inside the lines. You could nap anywhere. Uh-huh. Even while driving. It's gonna be great. I can't wait to be all run-down and weathered and wrinkly. That's sweet. It would be sweeter if you hadn't thought I was a tr*nny before, but it's still sweet. Hey, Ted, can I ask you something Will you sign this petition? Save The Arcadian"" We are gonna stop the bastards at Goliath National Bank from demolishing it. Will you support us?"
1573,6,5,zoey ,"So what do you do, Ted? I need your help. (They go outside. Zoey opens the back doors of a truck) Just to warn you. What I'm about to show you is not a hundred percent legal. I stole them, Ted. My animal rights group liberated these guys from an evil cosmetics company. And I figured, ""Hey, Ted's a vet. He can check them out and make sure they're okay."" Nah. I've been arrested lots of times. Chinese Democracy. Well, I'm usually crazy for a good cause. I can't just sit by while voiceless people or animals, r even buildings et screwed over. 'm certainly not going o just sit by hile GNB turns The Arcadian nto a soulless metal box. Ted, I will find the bastards at GNB responsible for this, and I promise you, I will take them down. Hey, guys! I appreciate the great turnout, but just so we're all on the same page, this is not a rally to legalize marijuana. Hey, Ted. I'm so glad you came. Great. I'll grab you a picket sign. Hmm. Do you want ""GNB puts the douche in fiduciary..""...or ""It's always 4:20 somewhere""? Dudes, you forgot your signs! Ted, everything okay? Yea... um... um... You work for GNB? Well, hope you don't mind, we made some changes to the billboard. Yeah. So you were saying, the facade will be completely preserved? Ted, wh-wh-what are you doing? Snakes? Hey, Mosby! You're gonna have to come out of your hole at some point, you son of a bitch! Yeah! Legalize it! Dude! Ready. Aim. Fire!"
1574,6,5,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, in the fall of 2010, I was designing the new headquarters for Goliath National Bank, which meant working side by side with your Uncle Barney. Ted from 2030: Everything was going great. That is, right up until Barney said... Ted from 2030: It was the site of The Arcadian, one of New York's grandest old hotels. In its heyday, it was the New York home to kings and queens. But lately... mostly just queens. tr*nsv*stite: Hi, handsome. Lookin' for a date? Ted from 2030: Kids, as you may remember, Max was a friend of Marshall's from law school... with whom Robin was really starting to hit it off. Marshall, thinking: Small pen1s. You have a small pen1s. Oh, that's super interesting, but you have a small pen1s. Damn it, Marshall! Okay. Okay. Think of any two words other than ""small"" or ""pen1s"". Got it: small pen1s. Damn it! Ted from 2030: As I was mustering the courage to call Zoey and tell her my true identity... Ted from 2030:...the strangest thing happened. Ted from 2030: As I looked up at that magnificent old structure, I realized I wasn't letting my feelings for Zoey mislead me. This building really was worth saving. Ted from 2030: That night, as I worked on a new design that just might solve all my problems... Marshall was visited by a disturbing vision. Ted from 2030: Kids, it was one of those moments in life where everything comes together... the girl, the building, everything, until... Ted from 2030: And as for Zoey, it was funny. I'd lied to her, then completely let her down. And I barely knew the girl. But there was something about her. I couldn't help but wonder if I'd ever see her again. Ted from 2030: Why, yes. Yes, I would see her again."

Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies.  Wow, lady. You got some tig ol' bitties! Gosh! Your body's a perfect... this many. (To another girl) Hi. Do you want to wrestle with our special bathing suit places? Come on!  Hey, want to have a three-way with me and my imaginary friend? His name's Otis.

I have some terrible, terrible news. I, Barney Stinson, can't pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy. Challenge forfeited.  I'm sorry. Challenge accept... Hey. No, I didn't feel like you needed me at all. Wait, where are you... That's a compliment. You are the least needy woman I've ever met-- that's awesome. I mean, no guy's gonna say ""Who's your daddy?"" to Robin Scherbatsky. You're your own daddy. And mommy. And weird survivalist uncle who lives in a cabin with a shotgun blaming stuff on the government. And that is what makes you the most... amazing, strong... independent woman I've ever banged. : Uh-oh, I'm in ""twubble."" Last night, after admitting defeat, I just let myself go. No!

(in baby voice): What'd you do, sweetheart? Well, I'm new in town and don't know many people. But yesterday, I met the sweetest man, who took me on a tour of the city. (whispering) Guys, New York is kind of cool. Then this cutie patootie took me to this bar called MacLaren's, right underneath his apartment. Yes! Guys, I went out with Robin's roommate. I saw her bedroom. (whispering) She's a messy Bessie. I made Robin my famous chocolate chip cookies. But instead of chocolate chips, I used gummie bears.  A spider! Poor spider."

Wait... hey, baby, why are you facing me north? You're trying to make us have a boy. All my least favorite students have been boys. So I Googled ""how to make a girl some really weird stuff came up but finally, I found this conception Web site that said you should point south at the moment of conception... eat a lemon......and heat up your lady parts to a balmy 105 degrees. (blow-dryer whooshing) Ooh... ah... Oh, that's not bad. See that? Another boy expecting a woman to clean up his mistakes. That's why girls are way better than boys. Oh, well, what about Chucky? Oh, so you finally agreed on a name? We're idiots. Whoa. I guess, but, dude, you're writing checks my v*g1n* can't cash. Me, too. Marshall... we just named our baby. Jamie. Not Jamie."

Why not? um, how about ""Ryan""? ""Johnny?"" ""Jeremy."" Well, I mean, geez, Lily. Why? What? Our DVR won't recognize it as a television program. No, it's not. It's fun. Here, watch this. Hey, Lily... Who's your daddy? No, she is not my daughter. I'm just her daddy. Oh. No. Not ""Tara."" Tara was the hottest girl in my high school. We were all, like, obsessed with her. We didn't just talk about her and fantasize about her... We wrote songs about her. Not ""Tara."" Oh. Oh. Hey, Barney. That prime rib was surprisingly good, but it's 10:30 in the morning. I don't need to see a lady get naked and dance. Then what does she do? Sweet mother nature! Not ""Esther."" I need a drink. Ted? Ted? Okay, honestly, I've never thought about having a girl. I don't want to think about having a girl. Tara, Esther -- can you imagine being one of those girls' dads? I have no idea how to raise a daughter! What if she makes bad choices? I mean, what if she winds up dating some... Oh, God. I don't want a girl. I just want a little boy. Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. Every time. Um, can you just sit in front of the computer like normal human beings? Perfect! Perfect. Um, to be honest, I'm getting a little freaked out about the idea of having a daughter. I know you two probably aren't the right people to talk to about this. You had all boys. I'm in a computer, Mom. Okay... No offense, Dad, but I doubt there's any scientific data to support-- Mm, I just need two seconds, baby. No, um... I'll be right back. This is ridiculous. (He imagines his daughter, pregnant et in a wedding gown) Okay. (He dunks your man sack in a big old bowl of ice) Mm-hmm. Eriksen!  Let's make a baby!

And what are you doing with those lemons? You're trying to make us have a girl! You are trying to make us have a girl. Lily, how could you do... exactly the same thing I did? You're supposed to be the sane one. Oh, really. Well, then how come whenever there's a creepy kid in a horror movie it's always a little girl? Or twin girls, who speak... (eerily): in unison. Okay, A) He was a doll; B) He was possessed by an adult serial killer; and C) How could you bring up Chucky right before bed? Esther? That's beautiful. Baby, names and gender, it's just, like... it's some way of giving ourselves the illusion that we have any control whatsoever. I- I just want a healthy, happy, 12-pound-- Ten-pound? Eight-pound? I love you. And I'm gonna love the crap out of whatever baby we have. You know what? We should just think of a name that's good for either a girl or a boy. Like, um..."

It was no co-winky-dink. Since the Viking age, the Eriksen men have passed down ancient secrets for conceiving boys. Number one, avoid lemons. They're baby girl fertilizer. ""I doubt there's any scientific data to support.."""" I had all sons. Your grandfather had all sons. Your great-grandfather had all sons. Scoreboard! Who you gonna listen to? Me?

Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky? You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men? Okay, uh, let me get this straight. So, in, uh, in this scenario, because you make such sweet love to Lily, she is now your daughter. Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy. No. Members of the G-8 convened today in Vienna to discuss plans to fight climate change by re... What? Hey, Becky, Becky, this is our news segment, okay? Nobody cares what you did yesterday. Mike! Okay, back to the G-8 conference. Hello? Mike, can I get in the shot? Fantastic. Ted, of all the women in New York, you had to go out with an eight-year-old girl? Ted, you know that I hate her. How could you go out on a date with this girl? Let me guess: she acted like a helpless little girl, and you stepped in as the big, strong man. Wait. Is that why you slept on the couch last night? Yeah, we don't care about this... Oh, but you find it irresistible when Becky does? I don't get it. The Ted that I went out with was attracted to the kind of woman who could use a steak knife without supervision. Needed? (scoffs) She makes training wheels feel needed. When we were dating, I... I didn't make you feel needed? I got this. I got this. Whoa! I got this. Did that really bother you? I got this. Hey. Hey. Um, when we were dating, did... did I make you feel needed? That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry. Thanks, Barney. You know, um... there's something that I wanted to ask you, and I don't really know how to say it so... here goes. Who's the crazy chick in the apron? I got this."

Don't knock the vodka. Wouldn't have a kid without it. We rushed her to the emergency room at 3:00 in the morning, but they wouldn't admit her without a name.

Robin insisted I confirm how ""awful"" Becky is, so last night I checked it out. Mmm... (muttering) I thought she was charming. Wow. That is disgusting. Marshall, your list is entirely boy names. You do realize there's roughly a 50% chance of you having a daughter, right? It's not what it sounds like, folks. Ow! Not what it sounds like, folks. It wasn't a date. She came over to the apartment looking for you. Aww... I don't know if that's totally true. It's okay, little darlin'. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Spiders gotta die so trees can grow. Then I held her tight and told her it was all gonna be okay. By the way, I think I only wounded the spider. It crawled off into my bedroom.  Yeah, I slept. No one challenged you, so it wasn't really a challenge. Wow, I'm glad that's over. It was creepy watching Barney talk like a little kid. For your information, Becky doesn't like steak, she likes pasghetti. Spaghetti. And more importantly, she makes me feel needed. Hey, it's nice to feel needed. And you know what? It's not a feeling guys get when they're with you. Come on! You always took charge of everything. Thanks. This okay? Am I hurting y... Someone's trying to break in-- call the cops. Well, yeah. It's nice to be needed. Look, I'm sorry. (phone chimes) I didn't mean to upset you. It's Becky. Aw, she's trapped in a revolving door. Yeah. Shoe's untied. I got it. Yeah, this is over."

Marshall and his friends, singing: * Tara, your booty is so smooth; And I hope this isn't rude; But I want to get up on it. * (Marshall is visualizing high school boys singing a song for his daughter:  then in a club: Marshall:Oh, okay, um... You guys, you're a little too close to the camera. Can you back up a bit? Robin:Wait-- did you go out with Ted Mosby? Robin:In other news, later today, a Manhattan architect gets punched in the throat. Woman:(baby voice) Someone needs to teach you how to share. Who's your mommy? Marshall & Lily: Jamie."

Marshall, we do some pretty bad things around here, but I... I changed the ice pack on his crotch every hour for three days. Wow, Eriksen, if you want to un-fire Randy, I support you, because to come in here and say what you just said, well, you've got a couple things that Tugboat doesn't. Yeah. I'll bring out your eyes."

Or the office Tu B'Shvat Pajama Jammy-Jam. I wouldn't consider any part of that bragging.  Looks like that bee got busy. That's a line. Does it get any better than this? There she is Florence Night-In-Bed-With-A-Stranger. Please tell me you are hooking up with one of your co-anchors again. (laughing) I care about our precious Earth. All you have to do is say ""I care about making dreams come true."" Everyone is in this video. Randy's in the video. I'll say this: There is no quit in that guy. You should fire him. Marshall popped his cherry! Oh! Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster. I mean, it reflected badly on the company. He was an embarrassment. A huge embarrassment. See, Marshall, if getting fired is an execution, at least the guy had a last meal. I promise you, tomorrow you'll feel a lot better. Uh-oh. I know that smile. Lily, there's no easy way to say this. Marshall's dead. Randy m*rder*d him. Anyhoo, while I got you-- big smile. ""We care about making dreams come true,"" in three, two... I'm not even here. Randy, the coffee. Here, try this, but really go for it. Remember, this guy ruined your life. Speaking of pickups, can we try the first one again? Yep. That's a wrap."

Just tell me who you slept with! Aha, it's someone we know. If it was some ding dong we didn't know, you'd just give me his name. Bill Pepper? Mm-hmm. Kind of a coincidence there happens to be a bill and a pepper shaker here on the table. Any chance you and Bill had a three-way with Fork Napkin? It's someone we know! Look, you're new at teaching. In my kindergarten class, I have had plenty of troublesome students. Like Johnny Marley... Johnny? Johnny! He and that little stuffed horsey raised all kinds of hell. But I have a simple method for shutting down troublemakers. You know that '98 Taurus that's always parked outside? The one with the really annoying alarm? Well, when a kid like Johnny acts up in my class... Shuts them right up. Oh, baby, what's wrong? You slept with Randy! Why, it's elementary, my dear Scherbatson. Your co-host is getting super-popular because of her stupid commercial, ""Boats! Boats! Boats!"" So, when you arrived at the GNB party after we left, you were feeling vulnerable and drunk. Then, from across the not-so-crowded conference room, your eyes met. And as we all remember... Randy has a unique condition. It's okay, baby. And did it work? No. I know why Randy is smiling. You're smiling because of Robin. No. Because you slept with her on Halloween. You didn't sleep with her? So why are you smiling? Hello. You don't. Ted, you're their teacher. The only people that like their teachers... A little bit. A little bit. Oh, a panda! You said that? Yeah. Robin, who'd you sleep with? Where's the poop, Robin?"

Yeah. Okay, get that camera out of my face before I flip you like a cheese omelet. First of all, that line makes me sound like a hooker and saying it makes me feel like a hooker, so. Wait. Randy, did you send the Hermanson contracts downtown? They never arrived at the downtown office. You shredded them?! That's not an expression! That has never been an expression! Okay, that, that right there. That attitude is exactly why I won't be in your video. Because GNB doesn't care. They hand out pink slips like they're hors d'oevres. Just last week, I was talking to Arthur... GNB treats people like they're disposable, and I will not be a part of that. Marshall Eriksen does not fire people, period. Period. Something bad happened. Randy, hey, have you seen the... That's the Hermanson contract? I need the Filbert contract! Sorry, Randy, but... this just isn't working out. Randy, hey, what's going on? Thank you. So where you headed now? No!! Arthur, I'm here because I made a mistake. I fired Randy yesterday. No, sir, that is what's wrong with this company. How can we say ""GNB Cares,"" and then turn around and treat someone like that? I mean, sure, he made a few mistakes but everybody makes mistakes. Like, like Tugboat here. Aw. I bet you he's made some mistakes. And you didn't fire Tugboat, did you? Exactly-- kind of. Randy doesn't need to be fired. He needs to be fixed. No, sir, I'm saying instead of getting rid of someone when they screw up, we should... we should help them. We should nurture them. This just isn't working out. Randy, great news! You're not fired! I got you your job back, Randy. I thought that you'd be happy. Well, then quit. No one's stopping you. Well, I'm sorry Randy, but that's called fraud. Even if I wanted to fire you, after my talk with Arthur... Listen, Randy, I'm sorry, but I broke my own moral code once and I felt evil. I will not let GNB change me. I will never fire anyone again ever. What are you doing? No, it's actually, um, nice having some of this clutter off my desk. So thank you, Randy. I don't know what I'm going to use this for, but it's great stuff. I've been meaning to clean out that file cabinet for ages. Oh! Okay. Okay. Thank you, Randy. I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine. That's just the pick-me-up I needed. You think working here is my dream? Randy. This is delicious. You're fired. I care about making dreams come true. You got what you need?"

At the risk of bragging, my Hazelnut Pilsner won fourth prize at the Weehawken Retirement Home Clam Bake and Wheelchair Maintenance Picnic. Hey, it just occurred to me, is your friend, what's her name? Garbin, Flabin... Robin. That's it, yeah. Is she gonna be here? Oh, not that I really care. No! Damn it! I'm leaving. I guess I can hang out a little longer. So, anyone going to see the Halloween parade? I care about old people. I don't want to brag, but in 29 takes, I only threw up thrice. I did. I sent them downtown. Why are you saying it like that? They... Well, just to make sure we're on the same page is ""send them downtown"" not an expression for shredding a document? Yeah. I sent them downtown. You know, down into the shredder. You-you feed the paper in a downwards fashion, so that's where the expression comes from. Okay, I can fix this. I am all over this project. Uh, just want you to know, we are making good progress on this new project. (phone rings) Oh, you gentlemen keep talking, I will answer that. Marshall Eriksen's office. [...] Yeah, I can get that for you. [...] Just a second. Uh... bank. The ""B"" stands for bank. Okay, Mother, I'll see you tonight. Oh, yikes. I'd better get Mr. Messy a napkin. (loud clattering) Before you get to that, regarding the earlier project I was working on... Voil&agrave;! The Hermanson contract? Oh, man, this is the Filbert contract. Damn it! No... (He shredds the file once again) Anyway, what's your thing? Well, I'll do what I can. But in my experience, twice shredded is fairly permanent. Oh, God, this happens every time I get an erection. I am so sorry. I just wanted to say no hard feelings. Downtown. (Randy jumps into the shredder, Marshall wakes up) Hey, guys. Robin? Like how I think about her when I'm in the shower? What? No. I went home, had a shower an-and went to bed. No. Even in the shower, the farthest we ever get is hugging. I'll tell you why. Thanks to that severance check, this time next year, you'll all be enjoying a frothy mug of Wharmpiss. But I don't belong here. I'm born to be a brewer! A... a hopsmeister! I-I can't. I need my severance check. It's not fraud. I'm just asking you to get me a lot of money to not work here and not tell anyone about it. Oh, come on, Arthur can't remember that. Thanks. It brings out my eyes. Oh, we'll see about that. No! Oh, are you unhappy with my performance? Well, I guess I'm fired, then. I'd better turn in my I.D. And there's more. Now am I fired? Okay, you win. Maybe trashing your office was a mistake. It's just, uh, as long as I can remember, making beer has been my dream. Wharmpiss? I know it sounds dumb to someone who's already achieved his dream, big-time lawyer at a huge corporation. Of course. Anyways, I'll clean this stuff up. Have someone get that dead squirrel out of your desk."
1601,6,7,robin ,"Crap. I don't want to talk about it. My co-anchor's a woman. You did a commercial? You're a journalist! Don't you want to be taken seriously?

Yeah, your nose is bleeding like a faucet. That's...exactly what happened. Hey, guys. I told you-- Randy. He was a machine. Fine. I didn't sleep with anyone. The thing is, ever since Becky did that commercial, everyone at work loves her. So, the day after Halloween, I was in a commercial. I'm going to the bathroom right now. Say... ""Ah..."" Well, hopefully you never will. They said that they might not even use it."

My class loves me; I-I'm really making an impression on those guys. I'd like to make impression on those guys. Robin? Looks like that French maid didn't turn down somebody's bed. Come on, Marshall. We get it. Uh, yes. (Robin arrives) Yes, it does. Please tell me you're not hooking up with one of your co-anchors again. Robin, you gotta not worry so much about being liked. Hmm... Boo... freakin'... hoo. Architecturally significant?! Zoey, you're very pretty. Your hair smells great. You don't know the first thing about architecture. I'm a professor, okay? I teach this stuff at one of the best colleges in the country. I don't go down to your place of non-employment and lecture you about how your little protest is a misguided waste of time, except whoops, I just did. Ha-burn. Well, I should head up. So, I'm assuming you all read the chapters on the Greek Revival architecture. Any questions? What are you doing here? Very well, then, let's get started. (clears throat) Some examples of Greek Revival architecture... No. Getting back to Greek Revival... I lost them. We're familiar with it. Lily, my students are adults, and I treat them that way. I'll just give them more candy and make them a mix CD. Problem solved. Guys, Prof Rock is a really good mix, okay? Boo... freakin'... The one day I miss the sack circle, you guys sub her in? No. I was returning a hot dog costume that you all enjoyed. Like gangbusters. We're buddies again. After class, we hacked a little sack to the thumpin' strains of my Prof Rock CD. And no, none of them had heard the Pixies B-side. Actually, none of them had heard of the Pixies. Or a B-side. I'm trying to eat here, buddy. Good morning, everybody... Where's my class? It didn't work. They hate me. How do I get them to like me again? I like my teachers. Was there more to that story? Lily, you're a psychopath. Anyone not in class tomorrow gets an ""F.""

It was recently made clear to me that I don't know the first thing about architecture, so here I am. Ooh! Ooh! Is The Arcadian Greek Revival? Oh, it's just this beautiful, old building that Professor Mosby wants to tear down. I may have mentioned our conversation over a session of hacky sack. Why'd you miss?

Ted from 2030: Oh, we were big fans of New York's annual Halloween parade. I don't mean the one that takes place Halloween night in the Village. I mean the one that takes place the morning of November 1st, the Annual Post Halloween Walk of Shame Parade. Ted from 2030: Robin had always believed that the key to success was intelligence, hard work and professionalism. Her new co-anchor Becky had a different philosophy. Ted from 2030: That was true of my teaching job. But I was also designing the new headquarters for Goliath National Bank, and well... Ted from 2030: No, GNB was not popular. That's why every year they produced a feel-good video to improve the bank's image. Ted from 2030: It wasn't okay. So the next morning... Ted from 2030: They were all turning against me, so I figured, what the hell. Randy, thinking: I'm fired. Great. This is the candle kiosk at the mall all over again. Wait a minute. I can get a severance check. If I don't shred it, I can use that money to start my own brewery. Imagine a beer with my name on it. Randy Wharmpiss, this is the best day of your life. Randy, wailing: No...! Arthur, entering the room: Marshall, what a memorable talk we had yesterday. Randy, on behalf of everyone at GNB, both in and out of prison, we're sorry. And I want to assure you you will never be fired again. You're going to work here until you die, huh? Green tie? (clears throat) Nice choice. Lily:...are dorks. Except for you, Miles. Ted, you just have to learn to embrace their hatred. Because behind that hatred lies fear. And you can use use that fear, like I did with Johnny Marley. Ted from 2030: I thought about Lily's advice. And I figured fear was worth a try. Ted from 2030: It ran for seven years. Ted from 2030: Kids, the next morning, my class had the highest attendance it had ever had. And not long after that, Randy used his severance money to start a little brewery. Now you can have a Wharmpiss at every bar in America. And all because..."

The Captain was Nathan Detroit to my assistant stage manager. Marshall and Barney here, are the future of Goliath National Bank. The Captain pretty much paid for this entire shindig. Take your seats, everyone. The show's about to start. Douche. Eriksen... It's, uh, 3:00 a.m. You know what, you might as well not even go home."
1608,6,8,barney ,"Exactly. I say, Marshall, my good man, how's my bow tie? Ah, bully! Wow, that's pretty cool. When I was a kid, I knocked down the blue whale. I was six. My uncle Jerry brought me here for the day. He said, ""Don't touch anything"". To a kid. That's like someone telling us ""Don't look at that girl's perky and impossibly symmetrical knockers."" So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale. I'm surprised security didn't stop me on the way in. It happened. And these people don't forget. This is not the Natural Stuff That Happened No More Than Five Minutes Ago Museum. Huh? The Captain? Ahoy. Challenge accepted. Ah, that's the stuff. Impressive. Try this on for size. I live for the dance. Sorry, sorry. This is ridiculous. We are two grown adults standing among the greatest collection of natural artifacts in the Western hemisphere, and look at what we're doing. Want to go touch a bunch of stuff? Niled it. Thank God you're here. She's been messing with the exhibits. Oh, yeah, that story is legend... (phone ringing) Hold on....dary. And, um, would you happen to know what that young man's name was? Thank you. Who's the master, Leroy? Uh, no, uncle. Jerome Whittaker is my uncle. Jerry's my uncle. It was that day... July 23, 1981. My mom got pretty mad that he let me destroy a New York City landmark. He never came around anymore after that. Think he moved away. But you do know, you do know. That's the thing. You know. He's my dad. I don't want to do anything. Don't tell anyone about this, okay?"

Did I stop writing poems for you?  Am I not as good at making the sweet, sweet love to you?  You said that any longer would be too much.  Well, you can't have me. Look at the sign. I'm extinct. I've gone the way of Jane's Addiction.  They did?  Are you serious?! That is awesome! Are they just as good?  Look, I know that Corporate Marshall wears a tie and everything, but it sounds like he hasn't changed where it counts.  There he goes. The Marathon Man. Mr. Stamina himself. I can kiss better than that old man."

A real man chooses his own name. Capital. Honey, I may cut out early. I have to go check up on the boat. Well, she's an 85-foot sloop. Do you like boats? Does the sea call to you like it calls to me? I like Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. You're coming on the boat sometime. Stepping off. Now, Arthur, your turn. I just sang three songs. Now you-you do your part from Guys and Dolls. So I hear my wife got you pretty good. Oh, that damn recorder. Try being married to that. ""But you said you'd get the corgis neutered this weekend."" ""I said no such thing."" ""Oh, yeah?"" Click. You're a good guy, Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. Tell you what, when Zoey goes to sleep, I'll find that tape and erase it for you. No hard feelings. Sure. Why not? I mean, I'm glad she has these little causes, they keep her out of troubles, but when she throws a temper tantrum and it gets in the way of someone doing their job, that's a problem. Hey, what about this? I'll take you out on the boat sometime. You've got to see this boat. She's breathtaking."
1612,6,8,guard ,"Well, aren't you two clever. Well, guess what, this museum has seen every kind of prank you can think of. Mummies playing poker, penguins sticking out of volcanoes, dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period hanging out with dinosaurs from the Jurassic period. One time a kid knocked down the blue whale. You name it... Oh no, not just someone. A six-year-old. No. But I could, uh, check the files. July 23, 1981, incident report. At approximately 1000 hours,...vandal dislodged rib from triceratops skeleton...and flung said rib at giant whale. Causing said giant whale to fall in a downward trajectory. And the vandal's name... Well, I'll be damned... Barney Stinson. Stinson was reprimanded and returned to the custody of his father, Jerome Whittaker. Uncle Jerry. Says father. Even signed it and checked the box for father and everything."

""The future of Goliath National Bank""? Oh, well, don't turn him down here in public. I broke up with Scooter at the prom. Right before the picture, too. So whatever you do, don't tell him here tonight, 'cause... What do you mean, you're going to say yes? But I thought that you... But a five-year contract. I thought you hated GNB. So what about becoming an environmental lawyer? What about saving the world? What would College You say if he heard what you were saying right now? So how long have you felt this way? You've known about this for two and a half years? So every time you've talked about wanting to be an environmental lawyer since then, that was a lie. What? So, you'll probably quit GNB in a couple years, right? And become an environmental lawyer? Hey, by the way, do you like this scarf? Okay, that's also a made-up word. I want you. No. Yes, but I'm okay with that. Actually, you're way better now. You last, like, two, three times as long. It's okay. College Lily thinks those are orgasms. No, it's... it's none of that. It's just this new Marshall... Corporate Marshall... he wears suits all the time. He doesn't care about saving the world. He's not you. I want you back. Actually, Jane's Addiction got back together. Yeah, they've done a few tours, they put out a new album. Sure. Hi. We'll make it work."

Absotively. But let's just remember, I mean, nobody's the same as they were in college. You know, it's like, I wear a suit to work every day. Okay, the giant blue whale hanging from the ceiling? The Captain? Ahoy, The Captain. Thank you, The Captain. I know, it's so, uh... You know, I totally forgot to tell you, but, um, the other day, Arthur offered me a five-year contract. I think I'm going to say yes. I-I want to keep working at GNB. Look, I don't hate all of it. Tonight's fun. Take a look around. I mean, this is pretty high-class. That was a great dream. But we have a mortgage, and we're trying to have kids. We're grown-ups now, Lily. Honestly? Probably something pretentious, and pseudo-intellectual, like... We all change, Lily. You know, you don't spell ""women"" with a ""Y"" anymore. And I'm okay with that. And you need to be okay with the fact that I may never become an environmental lawyer. Honestly? Since my first day at GNB. Technically, I never lied. You asked me questions, and I responded with made-up words. Affirmatootly. Yepskerdoodles. Posititochadochmecochepopocha. Lawyered. Okay. Lily, what do you want from me? I want you to be the person I fell in love with. Hey. Look, Lily, I know that you would have been okay if we were poor and I was trying to save the world, but will you still be okay if I make a lot of money and I spend all of it spoiling you and our kids?"

I'm Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. The boat? There's a boat? You must tell me about this boat, Captain. She! Yes. The sea is all like, ""Ted, come hang out."" Man, I wish me and my dad were as close as you guys are. No, if I wanted to make it personal, I'd call you a bored little trophy wife who likes to play activist when the shops on 5th Avenue are closed. Down where? To the yacht club? Oh! I would love to. W-w-wait. I'm half Jewish, will that be a problem? Wieners and gonads. Boogers. Hershey squirts. Oh! Zoey! There you are. Oh, my God. You have a monocle. Is this real? Is this really happening? Good luck k*ll*ing James Bond. (Zoey takes Ted away) Are we allowed in here? I want my crossword day back. Okay? Go live your perfect little life, and leave me the hell alone. Oh, please, what's your biggest problem? Having to sail back to the marina because the Captain's all out of white Zin? Oh. Great. Now you're crying. Like that's going to get my sympathy. He seems like a good guy. He wears those red pants. It's not crazy at all. I'm the same way. Look, Zoey, The Arcadian should be a landmark, it should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate that we have to tear it down. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of wieners and gonads. What? You tricked me. She caught me on tape trashing GNB. Really? You'd do that to your own wife? No, you know what? Don't erase the tape. And for what it's worth, I don't think she's throwing temper tantrums. I just think she's, you know, standing up for what she believes in. I respect that. I'm serious. It's a great look. I think it could come back, but one question. Does it cost half as much as glasses? Oh, I thought we were... What? Thanks. You look gross when you cry, you know that? Some women look cute. You look like a basset hound. Bring it on, Princess."

Ted, this is my husband. This is Ted. Oh. You want to make this personal? Okay. Destroy Ted Mosby. Now it's personal. You're going down. Can you excuse us for a moment? Let's go for a walk. What do you want from me? My life isn't perfect. I got married when I was 22 to a man who calls himself The Captain. I hate boats, Ted. I do, I hate 'em. I can't be on them. I can't be near them. I can't even think about them without getting seasick. You want to know why I want to save that building? Because when I look up at The Arcadian, I see something big and solid, and right now everything else in my life just feels like I'm on a boat. I know it's crazy to care that much about a building. Ted, that was... really easy. This should be useful. Well, it the bug room, Ted. Your ass just got bugged. Oh, the offer still stands. We simply must have you out on the boat sometime. Can I steal you for a second? You don't need to worry. I... What are you doing? Fine. I erased the tape. I don't need it. I'm going to beat you fair and square. But it's good to know how easily you can be manipulated by a woman. Oh, laugh it up now. Because starting Monday, I got you in my crosshairs."
1620,6,8,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, one morning in 2010, I opened the newspaper only to discover an op-ed written by Zoey Pierson. You remember Zoey. Ted from 2030: In those four column inches, she railed against me and my company, GNB, for wanting to tear down a beautiful old building: The Arcadian. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the piece ran on a Saturday, which as you both know, is Dad's crossword day. Ted from 2030: Okay, that night we weren't entirely un-fat-catty. You see, every year the Natural History Museum holds its Autumn Spectacular. It's attended by some of the most powerful and important people in New York, and, thanks to Goliath National Bank... us. Ted, whispering: Poo-poo. Poo-poo platter. Ted, whispering: Wieners. Ted from 2030: It did. Ted's voice (on a recording): They're a bunch of wieners and gonads. Ted from 2030: And in that moment, another headline appeared before my eyes. Ted from 2030: Kids, there's an amazing architectural phenomenon in the Natural History Museum. If you stand in the right spot, you can hear an entire conversation all the way across the room. Lily:No. I mean, I want you as opposed to who you've become. You've changed so much. Ted from 2030: And so Marshall stayed right on at Goliath National Bank. Of course, it wouldn't last forever. But that's another story."

So, is this the one who's best friends with Robin now?  I'm sorry to hear that. I miss Robin.  Oh, Robin didn't stop being friends with me. I stopped being friends with her.  Because I had a baby. Honey, when you have a baby, all that best friend stuff-- hockey, bow hunting for caribou, math...that all goes out the window. I mean, I tried to stay friends with her, but it just didn't happen. She took it pretty hard. I even thought she might try to k*ll herself.  Didn't you do the same thing? Minus the baby?  Be careful, Lily. I made those promises, too. And now I haven't even talked to her in five years. Sure, I thought about picking up the phone and calling her a hundred times, but I just never have the courage to actually...(Marshall is playing the piano) Hey. Go ahead."

Hey, Robin, do you want to go get a Korean massage on Saturday? Yeah, I figured I should get one now because once I get pregnant, no more massages. Just so annoying. Yeah. Come on, Barney. It's just a cute little story about... What exactly is this about? Oh. Oh. I have to say, as much as I hate to agree with Barney, this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia. Hey, if you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her? But BFFs are forever. I don't get it. How can you and Glitter just stop being friends? Best friends don't do that. Whoa. What do you think came between Robin and Jessica? Four years, three months. Robin's gonna dump me! Where are you going? We just got here. By yourself? Guys, did you see that? She's going to a Korean massage without me. That's our thing. I'm telling you, she's gonna dump me, just like she dumped Glitter. I don't. 384 months. Crib... Rattled? I want to talk about babies. Look, I know you don't care about this stuff, but I'm about to become a mother. And as a future mother, I'm gonna need the support... What's that supposed to mean? Well, guess what? I've got some good news. When that baby comes, you don't have to see it. In fact, you don't have to see me. This whole friendship thing? Done. Great. I had to. We were growing apart, and we're better off without each other. No! I can't. The damage is done. Can you just hold me? Okay. What are we doing in Madison Square Garden? How did you find Glitter? More like ex-best friends. Just like you. Yeah, well, Marshall and I are about to get pregnant, and I know she stopped being friends with you when you had a baby, so... What? Why? Wow. You dumped her just because you had a baby? That's cold. Oh, God. I gotta go. I gotta go apologize to Robin. I- I need to tell her I love her, and that she'll always be a priority. Oh, there you are. Robin, I owe you a huge apology. I know. I know all about it. It's not gonna happen with you and me. And I'm sorry I've been going crazy with this baby stuff. I know you hate babies."

Oh! Seven times four? Keep going! Eight times nine? Don't stop now! Almost there! 23 times three? Okay, girls. Everyone knows a beaver's favorite food is wood. I just hope we brought along enough of it for our three-day galactic space journey. So let's do the math. If Robin's beaver devours six inches of wood every half hour, and Jessica's beaver devours eight inches of wood every 45 minutes, how much wood will I need to keep both of these beavers well-fed all weekend long? While you figure it out at home, how about we sing you a song about our beavers?"

Of course. Robin hates kids. That's got to be it, right, Lil? Lil? Oh, sweetheart. Dude. Feel the room. Lily, come on. We don't even know that's what happened. Look, Lily. Robin is clearly getting tired of you constantly talking about babies. Lily, how old am I? Okay. So before you Lily all over the place, maybe you should try hanging out with Robin and not talking about babies. For crying out loud. You broke up with Robin? Okay, Lily, you sound about as convincing as you did the time you ""accidentally"" shredded my Joey Buttafuoco pants. Get on the phone, call Robin and fix this. You know what? No. I don't agree with what you did, and so I refuse to comfort you, despite how adorable you are when you cry. Okay. Maybe just one cuddle, but then that is it. Okay, you refused to talk to Robin. So I thought that you might like to talk to... the organist for the New York Rangers. Jessica Glitter?! Simple, really. I used my powers of deduction. You see, I knew Glitter used to be a keytarist, which is basically a piano, so I just made a list of all the keyboard-based occupations and then I cross-matched them... Yo, Glitter... Be cool. Charge! I'm so happy you guys made up. Come on, Barney. It's a sweet song about friendship."

Remember those? Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied in your pants down by the lake? Unbelievable! Busted! Times Square's the b*mb! I got so many great pictures of all the billboards. They got better billboards then the ones in Times Square? Times Square's the b*mb! I'm going to go pee in the jar I got going in the alley. Ted, come look at this. I found a little wounded bird in the alley. You know what it is, Ted. You know what it is. Come on, Ted. You always fall for that. Hey, do you guys get Big Chuck and Little John out here? Back to Times Square?! I don't know if I can do that, bro. I mean, yeah, I've been jonesing for a piece of Cleveland-style pizza, but I feel bad about leaving you out here. I worry about you, Ted. Yeah. The other day, when you called... Schmosby! Hey, good talking to you, Ted. Definitely. It was my friend Ted. He sounded kind of depressed. Yeah. He's not doing so good. Poor guy lives in a tiny apartment in New York, nowhere near Times Square. He's got no family around. He's still single, doesn't have a backyard. It's just a bummer. You think that would work? She's my angel. In fact, uh... We're getting married. Thanks, Ted. Thanks. Actually, that's the other reason why I came out here. I wanted to see if you'd be my best man. Yeah! That's great!

It's a kids' show! Like Electric Company or Sesame Street or, um... Exactly. It's just bad camera work, okay? Wayne, our camera guy... he wasn't that great. You know what? I feel bad for you Americans, that you can look at this wondrous and educational adventure through space, and see something obscene. Can you just please try to look at this with the innocence of a child? Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card from her every year, but we're not really friends anymore. Well, we did, okay? And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it. I got to go. No. Just watch it without me. Okay, it's not p*rn, it's a kids' show. Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off. I'm serious. Our characters had pet beavers.

Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied on our couch in the form of your idiot high school friend? Unbelievable! Don't care. Get a hotel. Okay, one night. Got to go. Oh, a Korean massage. Well, I figured you'd be busy, reading What to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect. Hey, Lily, what brings you to the crib? What's the matter? You look rattled. What? Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet. It means that a fertilized egg has not yet attached itself to the lining of your uterine wall. You see? I read your Facebook updates. God, it's like it's all you ever talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it! Great. No, okay? Me first. I've been pulling away from you, and I'm sorry. It's just, the last time my best friend had a baby... Whoa. Look, I hate most babies. But your baby? I'm gonna love that kid so much. I'm gonna pick it up and everything. Oh, my God. It's the beaver song.

Like, when the Roadrunner and the Coyote clocked out and had a beer together? Or-Or-Or Tom and Jerry shared a cup of coffee. But it's Thanksgiving. I don't get it.

My junk ended up in some stranger's pocket. If there phone was on vibrate, I basically dry-humped them. I'm afraid you are, Ted. You see, when you left last night, you changed the course of Blitztory. Hey, just so you guys know, there was a tiny expl*si*n at the sewage treatment plant across the street from our apartment, but I'm sure it's fine by now. Guys? Wait a minute. Where's Barney? You missed it. Life moves pretty fast, Barney. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it. Oh, God, that is disgusting! No... no, Ted. Random number guy just sent me his wang back. Dude, you walked out of the room, the laws of physics stopped and the laws of awesome tripled. Dude, The Blitz isn't something that can be bought or sold. Oh, look. We got an answer. Here it is. ""Yes, enemies can become friends. ""Remember what Gandhi said.

You sent a wang out, and you got a wang back. Nice. No, I meant the wang. Well, let's get an outside opinion. ""Dear Wang Guy...Can enemies ever be friends? Just wondering."" He's bold and uninhibited, so why not? And guys, you know what? For fun, why don't we ask him what he does for a living? Wouldn't that be fun? Just ask... What? No. Shut up. I hate him. What does that have to do with anything?"
1645,6,10,steve ,"Did they tell you about the skateboarding dog? It was awesome! This is awesome! I'm part of this! This is awesome! Mom keeps an extra litter box in here. There you go. Good as new. Oh. Hey, Ginger. Oh, my goodness. Our cab took a wrong turn. We were in the Thanksgiving Day parade! You're safe. It's okay to leave the room. You have to actually leave the building for something cool to happen. Okay, I got to test this. I just wanted to see something cool happen. I'm sorry. But I was on that island for what seems like eternity. I'm going to enjoy things on the other side. Facial! Word play. Loving it. Coven. Group of witches. Oh! Serve returned. God, I'm so happy to be here. My face hurts from smiling. Uh, did Wang Guy just quote Gandhi? Come on, man. Don't be that Blitz. And I'm a part of it. Oops. We forgot to light the candles. Aw, come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad. Aw, man. Oh, go ahead. I forgot my jacket."
1646,6,10,ted ,"Instead of stuffing, I'm going to fill the turkey with... a slightly smaller turkey. It's called a Turturkeykey! Your loss. All right, it's dead in here. I'm gonna call it a little early. Wh... you sure? We got big plans. Well, tonight, we're doing the same thing, only with ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's Greatest Hits and Apocalypse Now. Completely naked! At the exact moment Brando first appeared, ""Weird Al"" launched right into ""Eat It."" Free beer for everyone! All right, first of all... there's nothing lame about brining a Turturkeykey, copyright pending. And secondly, I don't believe ""The Curse of The Blitz"" is real. (gasps) What the hell happened here? Aw, man! No, no! Let's get one thing straight, okay? I am not The Blitz. Please stop. Okay, fine. Wait! Wait! Wait! What's that? What's ""The Gentleman""? I'm not The Blitz! (Ted goes into the bathroom, he hears a person yawning and opens the bath curtain) Zoey? How could you, my best friends in the world, hang out with my mortal enemy, then let her sleep in the tub where I clean myself?! Finish the story, Red. I missed a skateboarding dog? It wasn't? Wait. Blitz was there, too? I'm not The Blitz! What? No! N- n-n-n-no! N-n-no! I'm not The Blitz! The only thing I missed last night was my best friends stabbing me in the back by hanging out with my worst enemy. Guys! I hate Zoey! That means you're supposed to hate her, too! Th-that's your rule, Lily! Tried?! Lily, do you have any idea how many people I've blindly hated for you? I hated Renée Zellweger with a burning passion for eight years, only to discover you meant Reese Witherspoon! That's Kate Hudson! No, we hate Zoey! I'm so furious at you all right now, but it's Thanksgiving, and I have a Turturkeykey to make. And not that I'm The Blitz, but could everyone please come with me into the kitchen? (all murmuring) Okay, I'm, uh, just gonna preheat the oven. Great. So not only did you guys betray me, but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving? It doesn't help. 4G? No. What-What are we supposed to do now? Barney, I don't know if the oven is deep enough. Plus, it's a display made of cardboard. It's not awesome! No. Absolutely not. No. I'm not The Blitz. I'm The Bueller. You know what this means. You're The Blitz. Chicka-chicka! Zoey. Okay, the Turturkeykey is officially cooking. Okay, guys, that's starting to hurt. Oh, what was that? I was distracted by the four-caret diamond your 53-year-old husband bought you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a turturkeykey to baste. No... I baste alone. Who canceled? Your coven? Are you happy? You're ruining Thanksgiving. Oh... I'm sorry, Lily. I'm just never going to like that woman. Enemies can't become friends. No, no, no. You guys can't be objective. You still feel guilty about last night. Who are we gonna... Really? Wang Guy? We're asking Wang Guy? Guys, despite the wit and wisdom of Wang Guy, Zoey and I are never going to be friends. We're just here for her oven and that's it. Oh, my God! What? No. It was an accident. Oh, great. Real mature. Lily, those are cartoon characters, and I'm pretty sure you're making up episodes. And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother! I guess we're going home. Lily, where'd you get that? And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother! We have to go back to Zoey's. Barney let us in. Look, I'm sorry your stepdaughter didn't want to spend Thanksgiving with you. I just do. It must be tough. I get that. Uh, you should hang on to this. You can give it to her next year. Hey, you never know. People don't stay enemies forever. Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes as good as it looks."
1647,6,10,woman ,"Oh! I'm sorry. I thought this was my room. Oh, hold the door!"
1648,6,10,zoey ,"Morning, Blitz! Thanks, guys! Last night was amazing! The Gentleman! Can I... help you? You're Lily Aldrin? The painter?! You're amazing! I bought a bunch of your paintings online. Yeah. Okay, Marshall. Truth or dare? Okay. I dare you to send a picture of your junk to a complete stranger. Okay. Everybody shout out random numbers. And... send! Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone anyway. It's Thanksgiving. What the hell? Happy Thanksgiving! Ted. Barney, could you get me some more ice? Yeah, it's not like Ted's integrity. I'm coming with you. Oh, I'm sure you're a master baster, Ted. But relax. I've got a ton of sides to heat up since my plans fell through. Yeah. They were worn out from putting that spell on your hair. Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either. Yes, they can. Right, guys? Did you do that on purpose? Oh, yeah. Well, like this is. Yeah, well, you started it. Oh, get out. All of you, out! Out! Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone, anyway. Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either. Get out! All of you, out! Oh, God. What are you doing here? Barney was here? I was walking around half-naked. How do you know that? It was the first Thanksgiving Hannah agreed to spend with me, and then at the last minute she changed her mind. She hates my guts. Yeah... Right. Next year. Before we eat, we should take a group picture and send it to Wang Guy. Ted, that is the best-looking turturkeykey I have ever seen."
1649,6,10,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, in the fall of 2010, I was hosting my very first Thanksgiving. And I wanted it to be unforgettable. Ted from 2030: Blitz was a guy we knew in college. Sadly, he was cursed. Ted from 2030: You see, every time Blitz left a place, something amazing happened. Ted from 2030: And over the years, ""The Curse of The Blitz"" continued. Ted from 2030: Kids, I'd live to regret those words. You see, the ""Curse of Blitz"" could be passed from one person to the next, at any moment. Blitz had gotten the curse from Jerry Windheim, back in freshman year, who got it years before that from Davey Beaterman. The original Blitz, Matt Blitz, was a guy who went to Wesleyan back in the '60s. He dropped out right before the school went co-ed. And then, Thanksgiving morning... Barney, singing: My Blitzy lies over the ocean; My Blitzy lies over the sea; My Blitzy lies over the ocean; So bring back my Blitzy... Barney:...To me. Ted from 2030: Kids, you remember Zoey. For the last two months, she'd been making my life hell. Ted:I'm not The Blitz! Everyone, chanting: Make out with Zoey! Make out with Zoey! Make out... Barney, laughing: That is amazing. And I was here for it. Now Zoey is The Blitz. Ha, ha! (weak laugh) Burn on her. Ted from 2030: And then the cab driver said the last thing any of us wanted to hear. Ted from 2030: And that's the story of how Zoey and I became friends. Ted from 2030: It didn't. It tasted wrong. Ted from 2030: And just as Barney looked away, it happened."
1650,6,11,barney ,"Everything he said was nice, but I am profoundly scared. Captain, what do you think of rainy days? And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited meto the big hair washing party. Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude. Lubricant is public property. (Robin groans) Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. Want to hang? Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for... something, and for that other thing. Oh! Wow. Thanks, Lily. You saved me. You saved us. Look, I know you didn't mean whatever it was you said that made me so mad. So, who's the eye broccoli? Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs. Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be? It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like... beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now. D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks. Let's say yes. What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face! Nah. Watch out! Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick? Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome. Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City... where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty. Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang? High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee. I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick? Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act. Breast-feeding. Hot. Really. When those things swell up to three times their normal size... so do I."
1651,6,11,captain ,"Boys! Great to see you! Looking smart. Have a wonderful time tonight, okay? Ahoy, Ted! Excellent to see you. Well, I'm afraid she's feeling a little under the weather. Looks like it's just you, me and six hours in frigid international waters. You're a hoot. I've been looking forward to this. For a very long time. Well, anchors aweigh! Vast, the sea. Deep. Endless. Going around for miles. You could scream and scream, and not a soul would hear you. Listen to this. (screams) Help! Somebody help me! I'm trapped on a boat with a madman! Help! See? Nothing. So, Ted, I noticed you've been spending a lot of time with Zoey. Ted, let me show you my harpoon collection. How now? Oh, bother. (sighs) Well... she's a goner. By now, the icy tide has already dropped its core temperature to near freezing. And down it goes. Now it's at 50 meters. Complete crushing blackness. 100 meters. The pressure is so intense, the keys are popping right out of its head. 200 meters. No one will ever find its mangled remains, save for the crustacea that feed off its lifeless husk. Can you hear me now? No. Because you're on the bottom of the sea. Ted, it's time. I have something for you. Wait here. Found it. Zoey told me you're a scotch drinker. I bought this special for tonight. Ted? So you really thought I was gonna k*ll you? Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous. If I wanted to k*ll you, I'd invite you to my hunting lodge. It's far more remote, and I wouldn't have to worry about you turning up in some nosy fisherman's net. Oh, I'm just jesting for sport. See, sometimes I don't bond as well with Zoey's younger friends. But I know she really likes you. I was hoping that maybe we could be buddies. Fair enough. The hunting lodge it is."
1652,6,11,lily ,"Sorry, I'm, uh, I... I- I don't know, washing my hair. Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one... Rule number one: don't go anywhere that has candles. Rule number two: No sharing food. In fact, anything involving saliva is off-limits. Toothbrushes, thermometers, lipstick. And the most important rule of all... No lying to the spouse about anything you do. You two never hang out alone. You just made up those nicknames right now. Oh! Sweet. No candles. Nah. You're a big... stupid octopus head! Ew! Ew! She lied to her husband? Uh-oh. So, what did you do? It's not okay! I didn't really think it was okay! Pur-leez! You lie to your husband all the time. ""Uh, uh, that shirt looks great on you""""I love your mom""""I never fantasize about Barney when we're doing it"""" Sound familiar, Pinocchio? No, you just need to spend time with her and The Captain together. If you're friends with the both of them, then there's not a problem. Great. So go make nice with Captain Creepy, and problem solved. Barney. Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But let's be honest. You've been super sensitive lately. Watch out! Watch out! I think I probably didn't. Wait. I still can't resist getting one last shot in. Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there. Want to hang? Wow... thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face! You're a jerk. Well, you're a big... stupid octopus face! Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman ""fat"" right to her face! Oh... You're a jerk. Really? That's so sweet!"
1653,6,11,liy ,"Nah. Whenever we're alone, you spend the whole time undressing me with your eyes. You even take off my shoes."
1654,6,11,marshall ,"Okay. That man is terrifying. I figured it out! I know what's so creepy about The Captain. Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey.Observe. The bottom half of his face... is smiling. He seems happy. Seems like a nice guy. (everyone is murmuring happily) But the top half of his face...wants to m*rder you! Cheerful. Wants to m*rder you. No. Cheerful. Wants to m*rder you. Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question. Captain, what do you think of ice cream? Oh, he loves it! Whoa, he hates them. He hates that he loves them. Running the water. Excuse me, Captain, how do you feel about Ted and Zoey having an intimate chat by candlelight? It'll be the last dinner they ever have. Please. Lily's right, Ted. Once you're married, it's very hard to be friends with a single person of the opposite s*x. No doubt, Robo Cop. I guess it's true. You and I never really hang out alone. What's wrong with this shirt? Totally. Did you catch the game last night? You know what's fun? Is cold weather sports. She's giving me nothing! He's just staring at me! She's just staring at me! It's making me nervous. Great, now my left eye is twitching. Lots of drinks. You were just thinking that this dinner is really boring. That's what made you think of your boring class in college. Robin, I'm an attorney. I guess it's 'cause we never hang out alone together. It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory. Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB. Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good. I don't think that's gonna be a problem. I'm sorry. Myth? And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually... Did we bet on this? As Lily's best friend, you are the last person on the planet o's allowed to turn into a mermaid. Big-time manatee. Huh. I don't know. Being out at sea can do crazy things to a man. Yes. I mean, sure, right now, you're bald and leathery ancovered in a thick layer of blubber... I asked Barney the same thing. Death? Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant, she becomes a manatee again. Never thought I'd say that sentence. Yeah, me, too. No... No, no! No! No, don't turn! I really do."
1655,6,11,robin ,"Okay. Captain, quick question: How do you feel about the Jonas Brothers? Ooh. Holding the towel. Yeah. Unless you're old friends, which is why I can hang out with Marshall whenever I want. Right, Marsh Madness? Well, let's. Let's have dinner together, just the two of us. December chill... so great. Yeah. Nail-biter. They are fun. Man, this is awkward. Marshall, it's cool. She doesn't see it. What the hell's going on with his eye? Am I supposed to not talk about that? Great, now my right eye is doing it. Oh, so many drinks. You know, I had this really boring poetry class in college. What?! What? No! No! No, no, no. Marshall, no. No. I... I just saw that board of specials, and I thought, you know what sucks? Being bored. Which I am not. So that clears that... right up. Fine. This night's a little awkward. Why is that? And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes. Wait, does that mean that I'm a manatee right now? What were those sailors thinking? you're afraid that if you spend too much time alone with me, I'll turn into a mermaid? Am I blushing or...? Okay, even if that happens, is there any way to un-mermaid me? Pregnancy? Uh-oh. I don't feel so good. (She vomits) Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry! Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting."
1656,6,11,robin and lily, I don't get it.
1657,6,11,ted ,"Keep smiling. He can still see us. Ooh. What-What is that? Great. Okay. Hey, guys, Zoey just told me about this great Frank Lloyd Wright retrospective tonight. Who's in? All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey. Well, if I can't share her lipstick,there's really no pointin even going. Why would anyone lie? Look, Zoey and I are just friends. If there was anything more than that, I wouldn't hang out with her. Well, Lily, you were right. Something weird happened with Zoey last night. Friends. Plural. Like-Like there was more than one of me. Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say you were out with friends? It's totally okay. Lily, ruling. Do I have to stop hanging out with Zoey? Actually, I do have a standing invitation from The Captain to go for a ride with them on his boat. Hi, Captain. The Captain. Captain. Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey? Or we could stay on dry land, hang out with some... witnesses. He's gonna k*ll me. Okay, calm down, Teddy. He's not jealous. He hasn't even mentioned Zoey. Just gonna make a quick call. Hey, silly question. What are our exact nautical coordinates? Head? Well, I got a big morning, so... Dry cleaners, bank, you know, so... Okay, now we're even! Well... ish. See? It's stuff like that. Why-why do you talk that way? We can. We can be buddies. Just not on a boat. Hey. You feeling better? You weren't? I get it. And you were right. He's a nice guy. I mean, he can be a little scary. Yeah, he's a creepy dude. But I like him. And I just want to make sure you and I hanging out doesn't, you know, cross any lines. I mean, if either one of us had even the slightest hint of feelings for the other, we shouldn't hang out. You don't, do you? No."
1658,6,11,waiter ,Can I get you two some drinks?
1659,6,11,zoey ,"Oh, that's the Captain. Yes, I call my husband The Captain, but that is the only concession I make to his seafaring ways. Hang on. Ahoy. I'm just out with friends. Yeah. The Captain's on his way home from Milan. He can get a little jealous sometimes, so I didn't want to make him worry. Is that okay? Hey, Ted. I have a confession to make. I wasn't really sick. I'm sorry. I was just feeling guilty that I lied to The Captain and... I don't know, I just thought it would be good if you two spent some time together. Yeah, he gets a little murder-y when he's nervous. Me, too. No. Do you?"
1660,6,11,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, in the winter of 2010, we had a new addition to our little group... Zoey. Zoey was married to... The Captain. Ted from 2030: There was just something about him. We couldn't put our finger on it until... Ted from 2030: And then Lily said something to Barney that insulted every fiber of his being. Ted from 2030: Wait. No. It had to be more than just, ""Nah."" Oh, I think she said... Ted from 2030: No, that doesn't make sense. Okay, hang on. What did she say? She said, um, uh... To be honest kids, I'm having a little trouble remembering exactly what their fight was about. Hey, it was 20 years ago! I'll remember. Anyway, the next night... Ted from 2030: The next night, Marshall and Robin went to dinner, just the two of them. Now historically, they had three solid conversation topics: cold weather... Ted from 2030:...sports... Ted from 2030:...and cold weather sports. Ted from 2030: They blew through them all in the first 16 seconds. Ted from 2030: That same night, Barney and Lily were still fighting about, um... something. Or was it that other thing? Barney, crying: No, I haven't! God, how can you say that?! Ted from 2030: Wait. They were on the street. Ted from 2030: And just like that, the fight was over. You know, kids, friendship is funny sometimes. Ted from 2030: Like I said, the fight was just getting started. Ted from 2030: Kids, here's one thing I do remember. I was pretty sure I was going to die that night. Ted from 2030: Okay, back to Barney and Lily and whatever the hell they were fighting about. Ted from 2030: Wait. Barney's not a woman. That's right... Barney wasn't hurt by Lily, Lily was hurt by Barney. Ted from 2030: Okay, now I'm on track. The rest of this story should make perfect sense. Ted from 2030: Okay, that makes no sense. Kids, I'm officially admitting defeat. I will never remember this story. I'm sorry for wasting your time. Ted:: Okay, you got to swim for it, Mosby. Man versus sea. You can do this. You didn't get a ""Good Effort"" ribbon from the Shaker Heights JCC Swim Camp because you don't have what it takes. Ted from 2030:And just as I started to realize that maybe I wasn't in danger after all, we hit a bump. Marshall:...but at some point, my stupid male brain will transform you into a foxy fish-babe singin' ""Part of Your World"" to my pants. Ted from 2030: Wait! That's it! That's what Barney and Lily were fighting about! The Mermaid Theory! But their argument didn't happen at the same time as all this other stuff. I'm literally in the wrong year! It happened much, much later when Lily was... pregnant. Ted from 2030: That was it! I remember now! Lily:What's that? Ted from 2030: See kids? Told you I'd get it! Ted from 2030: Yeah, that's the ending to a whole other story. We'll get there. Robin, slurring: You know, once we stopped trying to have a conversation and just focused on the drinking... I had fun. Ted from 2030: And then a terrible thing happened. Marshall's beer goggles kicked in and his very drunk mind started to see... Ted from 2030: And from that moment on Marshall never worried about Robin becoming a mermaid again, and the two of them were closer than ever. Sailor #1: Still no sign of land. Sailor #2: It's been 243 days since we've seen another living soul. What are you looking at? Sailor #1: Dude, we need to find land."

I frequently sleep with sixes, chubsters, over-thirties... I am the bill and Melinda gates of the sympathy bang. What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations! Huh. Marshall and Lily are doing something meaningful. And it's making me less happy about this bonus. And I'm still single. At least I got that going for me.

Just wait, because tonight, (imitating Oprah) is Barney's Favorite Things! Barney's Favorite Things! I'm gonna give you all a bunch of free stuff... like Oprah. Just get excited, okay? Velour track suits! Remote control helicopters! Condoms! And last but not least... There is a fleet of limos outside waiting to take us to... A strip club! (Applause, cheering) You get a lap dance! You get a lap dance! You're gonna give me a lap dance! Everybody gets a lap dance! That was amazing! It was like a diamond suit for my soul. I gotta keep going. I gotta do more. I'm not going back either. I'm taking the rest of my bonus to God's strip club. Sam. Uh, father. I-I don't mean father father. Unless... I'm thinking about giving some money to charity. No, I don't mean that charity. That charity is doing peachy. You'll see pics of the two of them in next week's e-mail. I-I recently started giving, and it felt surprisingly good. I want to do more. Well, I would love to help by writing a check for... one, zero, zero, zero... Diamond suited up. Hey, Ted, can you spot me for the movie? I don't like to carry a lot of cash on me. Yeah, that was back when Lily was pregnant. Now she's not. Ergo, a suit is born. (Chuckles) Dude, what's up with the gingerbread house? You look ridiculous! Ah, I know that move. You cut a hole in the floor, she reaches into the living room, finds the tree... Nice. What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations! What am I doing with my life? Get a puppy! Oh. Our movie snack. I can't give this suit back. Ted, I glow in the dark. I finally glow in the dark! Nope. And there's more. Do you still do that thing where you give people in need clothes for job interviews? Bring 'em in, boys! Merry Christmas. Son?! Hi, there. We've had a lot of fun tonight, but on a more serious note, this is the time of year when we remember the importance of giving. And there's no greater gift than the gift of booty.

Just keep smiling, maybe wave. No, don't wave! That makes no sense! Let's leave, then the waving will make sense. Let's do it! Uh-huh, got it. Okay, that seems easy. Blue? What if it's a girl? Oh, God, it's 8:00! We're supposed to meet the gang at the bar to celebrate. No, I can't keep it together! The iPod was on shuffle! (Rock music stops) The Jerky Boys! Our baby heard the Jerky Boys! The Jerky Boys aren't funny, they are awful. Marshall, I don't like this. So disappointing. Huh? Yeah. Why wouldn't we be? Oh, the baby thing. Don't reach into the living room! Yeah, this whole thing got us thinking. Maybe we're not ready for kids yet after all. This kid doesn't stand a chance. We're ready for this. Positive."

Okay, you're the one who put the Far Side calendar up over the toilet. You know I laugh with my whole body. It's positive? It's positive. Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier. Can't imagine anything bringing me down right now. Well, that did it. Are you sure you did it right? Oh, my gosh. That's amazing news. Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier. Hey, guys. Big announcement. No, just a $30 gift card to Costa Coffee. we've never been happier. can't imagine bringing e down right now. Huh? I don't know what that is. Velour is so comfortable. They're so soft. This is great. I'm happy. I'm so happy, my heart's pounding. And I'm sweating. And I can't breathe. This is what happiness feels like, right? Oh, crap. Lily's having a baby and I'm having a panic attack. I hope she can't tell what I'm thinking right now. Do you think the others can tell we're freaking out? They're totally onto us. What do we do? I'm committed. I'm riding this wave straight to hell. Lily, we have to relax. There's no need to panic. True, there's a lot to do, but we've got nine months to prepare. So I say that we just make a list of everything that needs to get done before the baby arrives and do everything on that list tonight! Nursery's painted! Damn it! Oh, God. Okay, listen. When we meet them, we have to keep it together. Can you keep it together?! Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier. This is a nightmare! We've done everything wrong! You know what, the Jerky Boys are funny. You know what, fine, if you don't think the Jerky Boys are funny, then I'm not sure that I can raise a child with you, liver lips. I know. Okay? I don't like it either. It's like I have a hot, burning ball of stress in my chest, and nothing will make it go away! Well, that did it. Yeah. Huge bummer. Oh, yeah, whatever. Oh, Christmas-themed movie snack. Nice. Oh. You know, we're actually kind of relieved. We were freaking out for about a day and a half there. Yeah, we were thinking maybe we would just get a dog.

1669,6,12,robin ,"What?! To Lily and Marshall. I do wish you were a dude. No, and here's why.,Ted, the best man's job is not to crush the floral arrangements. It's to get the groom down the aisle, because, no matter who he is, he will freak out. And I just don't think you have what it takes to get that get that soldier to pick up his r1fle and charge up the hill. And how did that go again? Oh for one. Ted. (Both yelling) Oh, do you take one to be your lawfully wedded wife? Oh, God, I'm freaking out. Why did I chose Ted to be my best man? Well, it turns out that Heads or Tails has a job opening. So now, because of that incident, Heads or Tails is looking for a new currency rotation specialist. They're not bimbos! Currency rotation specialist. Well, it's a national audience! I get to wear shiny dresses! I am never drinking again. I moved here to work for a big-time cable news channel like World Wide News. Mm-hmm. Well, by this time next year, I will be wearing a World Wide News I.D. badge around my neck. And to show you that I'm serious, this is my first and only drink of the night. Okay. Okay? Oh, damn, that's smooth. Well, I did, but they only offered me a boring, low-paid, off-camera research job. Well, so could Heads or Tails. (snorts) The first currency rotation specialist went on to be a semi-finalist on The Bachelor, and then, she lost, like, a hundred pounds on The Biggest Loser, and now she's totally winning Celebrity Rehab. What?! Oh, my God! They're really having a baby. What am I doing with my life? Starting Monday, I'm a currency rotation spe... Oh, who am I kidding? I'm a coin flip bimbo, and I'm still single. Okay, let's not go there, Scherbatsky. That's a whole other thing. I've got to take that World Wide News job. Well, you are looking at the new associate researcher at World Wide News. Marshall and Lily. I just realized that I am about to have a little niece who looks up to me. And I don't want to be sad aunt Robin, the aging coin flip bimbo who gives her the creeps. I want to be cool aunt Robin, the respected journalist... (quietly) Who gives her beer. What? Oh. I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall. Hi, Mr. Trebek. This is Robin Scherbatsky. As honored as I am by the offer, um... (Phone chirps) Oh, my God. They're not having a baby. What am I getting all up in my head about? That research job sounds hard. And I'm pretty. I'm really, really pretty. You are looking at the new coin flip bimbo. Yeah. Okay, I also said I would never make out with a garbage man. Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. What's with the gingerbread house? Let's hope Santa brings you a girlfriend this year, Teddy. And now she's totally winning Celebrity Rehab. What?! What?! What am I doing with my life? I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall. Fine, I'll call them tomorrow. I'll call them right now. You know, that was really cool what you did. When we all needed it, you got us back on the right path. Hey, Ted, if I, um, if I ever get married and you're not the guy I'm marrying... Ted, will you be my best man?"

Well, now you're talking. We have this program that helps those in need get back on their feet. We give them food, a place to live, clothes for job interviews. That's great. Thank you, Barney! Wow. That's a lot of zeroes. Y-you sure you're not missing a decimal point? Yeah. Why? Thank you, son. It's just an expression. I'm still not your dad."

Peonies, lavender blossoms with a halo of baby's breath for an ambiance of springtime rejuvenation. It's gonna be a magical day. (Ted hangs up) I know what you're thinking. I wish I was a dude. Because if I was a dude, I could have Ted Mosby as my best man. Uh, are you forgetting I've done this before? I was Marshall's best man. Oh, come on. That wasn't my fault. And need I remind you, I gave a beautiful toast. Uh, yeah. It's hard to take criticism from someone who just recorded seven episodes of Million Dollar Heads or Tails. Why this sudden obsession with Heads or Tails? You mean coin flip bimbo? You auditioned, didn't you? You're the new coin flip bimbo? Robin, you better check yourself before you trebek yourself. You're a journalist! What is the matter with you? Robin, have you forgotten about your New Year's resolution? No, before that. Before that, too. I thought you finally got that interview at World Wide News. Which could be a stepping stone to bigger things in your career. What changed your mind? You took the Heads or tails job? What about World Wide News, your I.D. badge? You made a New Year's resolution. We're seeing a Christmas movie. It's a Christmas-themed movie snack. Where the hell is Barney? Bon Jovi? My God, Barney! I work for GNB, too. All I got was $15 gift card to Costa Coffee. Uh, has it ever occurred to you to give some of this to charity? Let me guess. You got a huge bonus check, too. Thirty?! No. No! I cannot go back to that strip club. I seen some things. What happened to giving the money away? It's a Christmas-themed movie snack! Where the hell are Marshall and Lily? I should get a Christmas-themed movie snack for tomorrow night. Are you guys okay? Wow, I-I thought you guys would be devastated. Are you kidding me?! All you ever talk about is having kids! And now you have one little freak-out and you want to get a dog instead?! No. Unacceptable! You're gonna turn around, you're gonna go home, get naked, lie together as man and wife until Lily is great with child. Right now! I'm serious! Go, go, go! And you! Ooh. Barney, you look real stupid in that suit. You're gonna go get your money back and give it to charity. And I don't mean that stripper you keep e-mailing us about, even though we beg you to take us off that list. Criminals of New York! Attention! This man is wearing a diamond-covered suit! You could retire on the pants alone! Merry Christmas! And you... You did not move to the greatest city on earth to become a coin-flipping bimbo. So here's how it's gonna work: Heads, you take the job at World Wide News; Tails, you take the job at World Wide News. Ow! Hey, looks like somebody got a new gig! Hello. Yes, you can! You love her! One for It's a Wonderful Life, please. Thank you. Congratulations. It's what I do. Big mistake, but go on. Are you asking what I think you're asking? Scherbatsky... I'm gonna crush it."

After all, it had been a crazy couple of days. It all started... Ted from 2030: With a pregnancy test. Marshall & Lily: One, two, three. Ted from 2030: Kids, this is the story of the 36 hours we all thought Lily was pregnant, and how it caused each of us to reexamine our own lives. Because while this was happening... Ted from 2030:...I was on the phone with Punchy, my best friend from high school, who had recently asked me to be his best man. Ted from 2030: Kids, Million Dollar Heads or Tails was an extremely popular show with an extremely simple premise. Robin, slurring: I am gonna finish this whole bottle tonight. Ted from 2030: It seemed like there was no changing Robin's mind. But what we didn't know, in that moment, was that our world was about to be turned upside down. Ted from 2030: Now, kids, when your friends have great news, you're happy for them... For, like, a millisecond. And then you start thinking about yourself. Ted from 2030: And so, the next night, we had two things to celebrate. Ted from 2030: So the next day Robin called Heads or Tails to respectfully decline. Ted from 2030: But at that moment... Ted from 2030: Where was Barney? Let's back up again. Ted from 2030: You see, while this was going on... Marshall & Lily: It's positive. Ted from 2030:...This was happening. Ted from 2030: That was the reaction Barney expected. This was the one he got. Ted from 2030: The next hour got pretty weird. Ted from 2030: The next day, he paid a visit to the most charitable man he knew, his half-brother's father, Sam Gibbs, a minister at a church out on Long Island. Barney:...Zero... (Cell phone chimes) Woops. Hold on a second. Wait. They're not doing something meaningful with their lives. Well, this changes everything. Oh, no, I've already written four zeroes. Thank you, decimal point. One hundred dollars. Ted from 2030: Let's back up one last time. Ted from 2030: Narrator: So Marshall and Lily headed home. Ted, yelling: No! Barney, singsongy: Marshall and Lily got in trouble. Robin, stuttering: So, if I get a large popcorn, you want to go split-skees or... Robin:...I could really use someone like you. You know, in case I freak out. When I freak out. You interested?"
1674,6,13,barney ,"Guys, we've got a problem. This is the application for the regional doubles laser tag tournament in Poughkeepsie. Problem is, only one of you can be my partner. So it looks like we've got a bake-off. You may now present your arguments. And Marshall's the winner. Yeah, and it cuts in and out. Oh, God, you found one of the cameras. I swear that's the only one. Wait, which one did you find? What are you talking about? Not today I wasn't. Or... or cost-saving alternative: you could get checked out by someone who looks just like him. I'm gonna go scrub up. I'll meet you in stall three. Wow, it is like looking into a poorly dressed mirror. How you doing, Lily?! Should I have a boner?! Hey, you don't mind if I take pictures, do you?! Aw, yeah. Smile for the birdie, Lil! Gyno-mite! Problem?! You can't get a girl pregnant. That's the dream. I'd give my firstborn to not be able to have children. Exactly! Or when your... I don't know... friend invites you to a laser tag tournament, you don't fight it. You just strap on the vinyl holster and race into that abandoned JCPenney g*ns a-blazin'. I'm just agreeing with Ted. I'll show you. ""Dad, there's, uh, there's something I need to tell you, and it's going to come as a bit of a shock to you, but here goes. You are speaking to the 2011 Tri-County Laser Tag Co-Champion"". ""Oh, and my sperm don't work. Yeah, yeah, the laser tag thing is awesome"". Think about it, Marshall. All entrants get 20% off at the snack bar! Oh, BT-dub, the receptionist. What's her situation? Bro, that is awesome. Motility five!"
1675,6,13,doctor ,"And how long have you been trying? Look, if you're really worried, here is a number for a reproductive endocrinologist... Dr. Stangel. He's the best in the city."
1676,6,13,judy ,"Surprise! We hadn't heard from you in a couple days. We were worried about you. Marshall. Marshall. I just got my new bathing suit for the beach this summer. It's a two-piece. I mean, can you imagine? Me in a two-piece bathing suit at my age? Just picture it! Picture it! And the top is so low-cut. Your father says he has front-row seats to the Minnesota Twins. Oh. Oh. By the way, Marshall, we do need to know if you're coming to Florida this summer. Are you coming? Marshall? Marshall, are you coming? Aw, Marshall. Hey, we don't care about that one bit. And if you guys want kids, there are other ways. Adoption. Maybe you have a good friend who could loan you some sperm? We didn't have a hair dryer, dear."
1677,6,13,lily ,"We've been trying and trying, and still nothing's happened. I'm just worried we can't have children. Six days. Something must be wrong. W... we're doing it a lot. Seriously, Doc, why isn't this happening? Well, what's your plan, Marshall, just have unprotected s*x day after day after day in every position imaginable until...? Wait, it sounded worse in my head. Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Stangel. It can't hurt. Ooh! How did you do it? What are you talking about? My visit to a certain Dr. Stangel. Just one, ""Dr. Stangel"". Where'd you get the beard? Wait, so you weren't wearing a fake beard and examining girl parts all day? Uh, Marshall? No, we've made a binding covenant with the universe. We said we weren't going to try to have kids until we saw Barney's doppelganger. Oh, this is bad news. This is like a black cat walked through my uterus. Okay, that's it. I am going back to Dr. Stangel and getting thoroughly checked out. I still kind of think it's Barney. Uh-uh, no. Can't do it. Okay. Convinced. ""Suit up""... not convinced. This whole thing stinks to high heaven. He could have pulled some crazy switch. Remember when his Swedish cousin came to visit? Yeah, I'm sorry, but unless I see Barney at the same time, I... I'll never be sure that Dr. Stangel isn't him. Thank you. Can we leave him in here for a while? Hi, honey. There's a couple messages on the machine. Your dad called. He wants to know if you have any sixes. Dr. Stangel's office. I'm extremely fertile. Okay, now you're being ridiculous. An hour ago, you didn't even think there was a problem. What's wrong? Already? Oh, honey. Oh, yeah. Isn't it great? They just showed up. Your mom's already rearranged my kitchen, organized my closet... and she asked me if I lost height. Not weight. Height. Oh, okay. Well, I'll go handle your parents. And you handle your, well... Wait, wait, wait. Marshall. He's going to m*st*rb*t*. Marshall, just tell them what's going on. Marshall... Something's happened. Um... Your father, he had a heart attack. He... he didn't make it."
1678,6,13,marshall ,"And everywhere... the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, outside in your wait... the kitchen. Dr. John Stangel? I don't know, baby, do we really need a specialist? I'm not playing laser tag. Damn it. Lily, I've been with Barney since 9:00 a.m. Between the sexual harassment seminar all morning and the secretary beauty pageant all afternoon, he hasn't left my sight. Yes, I know, we made our little deal with the universe, but... There's no way it's Barney. It's Barney. Wow. Really, dude, bravo. You almost got a peek. But seriously, what second-rate community theater did you get...? So my wife and I are trying to get pregnant. No, but, baby, I yanked on his beard. No, Barney... Doctor, wait, please, it's... Can you just give us a couple minutes? I... Lily, how can I convince you that this is not Barney? Baby, you just saw Barney. Oh, yeah... Bjorney. Hey, babe. Yeah, uh, we got a game of ""Go Fish"" going on the phone. P.S., Pops, go fish. Who's the second message from? You're extremely fertile! Oh, my God. I told you there was nothing to worry about. I got to call my dad and tell him the good news. If you're fertile, um, then that means I'm the problem. Well, I was just putting on a brave face. Okay, think about it: we've had unprotected s*x 203 times in the past four months. Obviously I'm the problem. Oh, it's my dad. No, no, you know what? Um, I'm gonna get my stuff checked out first. I'll call my dad after Dr. Stangel gives me the thumbs up. I only like to call my dad with good news. I mean, telling him good news is what makes it feel real to me. I'm getting married! I passed the bar! I found an amazing Viking lamp that fits right on the coffee table, as long as we don't mind stepping over the cord. Right?! I found someone who can fix the Viking lamp! But the news that I might not be able to give him a grandchild? You know, like, I don't even know how to have that conversation. Barney, I've already told... I am freaking out. Is there a chance that I can't have kids? I've been hit in the nuts a lot. I can't do it, Doc. Is there, like, another option? Could I... Could I take this home? Only way I know how, Doc. Only way I know how. Mom. Dad. Uh... What are you doing here? Go fish. Excuse me. Hey, Lily, can I just talk to you in here for a minute? Yeah, I'm very excited that they're here, too. But right now, I have to get excited about something else. Thank you, baby. You're the best. This isn't working. I'm... I'm going to... I'm... I'm going to... Lily! And so, now, I'm just scared that we won't be able to give you a grandchild. Aw, yeah. Maybe adoption. Wait, you knew? Oh, God. It's just... Damn it, Barney! What are you doing in here? And? My sperm is fine! Hey, um, can I borrow your phone? I want to call my dad. Man, this is great. I was expecting bad news. I really was. You're here! Oh, my God! I love you so much! Can you believe it? My dad's dead? I'm not ready for this."
1679,6,13,marvin ,"Yeah...! All right! That's what I'm talking about! Surprise! For God's sake, son. Do you have any sixes? That's why Fred Cox is the greatest kicker the Vikings ever had. Give me a ""C"". Give me an ""O"". Give me an ""X"". What's that spell? Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox! Where you going, son? What I'm saying is, we love you no matter what. Now, why don't you pretend you're in high school, get back in that bathroom, and ""blow dry your hair""."
1680,6,13,robin ,"Hi, guys. It gets worse. No! Ugh! And I can't believe it's my first day, and already I'm the girl who slept with the host of the show. Well, now that I know it's Sandy, I'm not. I wish I was the office slut. And we can explore how those policy changes will affect Iraq. We did not have s*x. I don't know, maybe because I'm a smart, talented, professional. Thank you. We did have s*x. But this reporter takes pride in... And now everyone calls me Scherpoopie. It's not funny. But I thought you talk to your dad about everything. And the fertilizer is seeping into the ground water, causing... Okay, yes, I, uh, I fell into some manure. It's hilarious, fine. In a five-year career of on-air reports, there are bound to be a few embarrassing moments. Uh, but in my case, it was just the one, and you found it, so, uh... Just the one. Everything. *Everybody, come and play*... I'm a dirty, dirty girl... *Throw every last care away; Let's go to the mall today; Today, today*... The Federal Reserve Board voted to leave interest... * Let's go to the mall; Today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Let's got to the mall today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Today; Let's go to the mall; Today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Today... ; Let's go to the mall... * They even found the video of me getting attacked by an owl. I did not get attacked by an owl. Okay, don't you dare tell me to steer into the skid, okay? It's too late. I'm already wrapped around a hydro pole. It's a Canadian telephone pole. I never should have taken this job. Who? Oh, God. Tell me you didn't go over there. Oh, God. Tell me those aren't the names of your fists. Oh, my God. This is... If people found out Sandy wears a toupee... Oh, no. He's very open about that. That's Gregory. Nice guy. Actually, it was a good day. Actually, Sandy, I have something I think you're all gonna want to see. Okay, I didn't do it. I didn't want to just viciously attack someone out of the blue like some kind of... Exactly. So, instead of taking your advice, I took your advice."
1681,6,13,sandy ,"We should have s*x. Robin. Know each other? We've had s*x. Yes. We definitely had s*x. Then why do I remember you? No, none of those. Oh, I remember. We didn't have s*x. You're the girl who did the report on the carriage driver and slipped and fell in horse poop... Oh, I... I remember now. Gregory, do me a favor. Is Scherpoopie pitching a story about manure? Genius. A few? Gregory. Ah... You're not the pizza guy. And I need more numbers on how the holiday season impacted the economy. Sparkles, got anything on malls?"
1682,6,13,stangel ,"So I understand you want to get pregnant. Hello, you must be Mr. Eriksen. I am Dr. Stangel. Would you...? I... All right, Ms. Aldrin, please just put your feet up in the stirrups. We can begin. He checks out. I really don't have time for this. Okay, you have to go. Leave the model of the v*g1n*. Great. All right, you're a little low on the table. Please scoot up. Well, we won't know anything until we run some tests. We'll need a sample of your sperm. No, no, no. There's a room at the end of the hall. If you find yourself inside the elevator, you've gone too far. You'd think I wouldn't have to say that, but you'd be surprised. Sure, you could, but, uh... we close in an hour and I'm not back till Tuesday. So, clock is ticking. Make it fast. I'm afraid I have some very bad news, Marshall. Judging from the results of your test, it is... it is very unlikely that you'll be able to father a child. I know, I know. Now... in some rare cases, a regimen change can fix the problem, so I'm recommending a spirited cardio routine. Preferably with a partner, involving any light-based firearm activity in the Tri-State area. Poughkeepsie, for example. Have you heard of the gentlemen's sport known as laser tag? Surprise! Go! Well, Marshall. I've got your results. Your sperm is fine. Count, motility... everything's off the charts. You, sir, have got some strong swimmers."
1683,6,13,strangel ,"We'll look at all the factors that contribute to fertility: dietary, environmental, genetic. But first, Ms. Aldrin, do you have any questions for me? Well, m... my mother's Armenian. Okay, we're all done. I'll call you in a few days with the results. I'm done for the day. You can leave him in here all night."
1684,6,13,ted ,"I'm absolutely not playing laser tag. Wow, we finally found Barney's doppelganger. I guess we can tell you now, Lily. That hot dog guy did not look like Barney. So, first day of work? Sandy Rivers?! Oh, I hate that guy. You had s*x with Sandy Rivers? Already? Were you planning on eventually sleeping with the host? So, second day of work? Oh, you didn't hear? She's the office slut. Robin, a word of advice: play along. Okay, the more you fight it, the worse it's going to get. It's like when your car slides on ice, you steer into the skid. Aren't you going to get it? He has to do that? So, third day of work? Oh, God. What did they find? You got attacked by an owl? Robin, listen, here's what you need to do... Show me ""owl attack"". Uh... Okay, I did a bad thing last night. I looked up his address. Sorry. You said ""who"". It reminded me of the owl footage. Genius. No. Sandy. How dare he laugh at you. Who does he think... Sorry. ""Who"". Anyway. I looked up his address in your contact list. I just thought he needed to listen to common sense and reasonable discourse. They're my feet. I'm actually more of a kicker. So I went to his apartment. This is how you make sure Sandy never makes fun of you again. I told you to steer into the skid. That was bad advice. So new advice. Steer into Sandy, and run him down. Really? That's your take-away? Nothing on the bear in the bra? So? Possibly last day of work? Yes! Put him in a body bag! What? Owl? Yeah, go ahead."

1686,6,13,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when Lily and Marshall started trying to have a baby, they went a little crazy. Ted from 2030: But then, months went by, and still nothing happened. Ted from 2030: So Aunt Lily went to see Dr. John Stangel, the man who knew more about human reproduction than anyone in New York City. Ted from 2030: Now, while all this was going on, your Aunt Robin was starting her new job at World Wide News, aka the big leagues. She was excited. This job was a new start, a clean slate. Ted from 2030: Sandy Rivers... Robin's old co-host and my old nemesis. Ted from 2030: Kids, at that moment, I knew what I had to do for my friend Robin. But first I had to do something for me. Man #1: All yours, buddy. The thing you're about to do in here... I did that in here, too. Three minutes ago. Man #2: I was here eight minutes ago. Man #3: 14 minutes ago. Man #4: I'm here every Thursday. Ted from 2030: Kids, to this day, your uncle Marshall is thankful for what Lily said next. Ted from 2030: And so Marshall told his parents everything. Ted from 2030: That day, Robin decided to steer into the skid. And though she never quite shook the nickname, Sparkles went on to do very well at World Wide News. Especially after this happened. Ted from 2030: After his parents had gone back to Minnesota, Marshall got the results of his test."
1687,6,14,barney ,"She said ""doody."" Wait a minute! Today, we are gonna make Marshall laugh. Ted, what's the one thing that always cracks him up? Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts, exactly! So we are gonna get our bro a four-star nad rattler. You search knees, feet, banisters, fire hydrants and diving boards, and I'll cover bats, rackets, hockey sticks, golf clubs and riding crops. Uh... Claws, paws, talons, hooves, beaks and clenched monkey fists. We can do this! Marshall Eriksen, you could use a laugh. See? 'Cause, 'cause he got hit... This next clip is entitled, ""Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets Hit in the Nuts by Low-Flying Seagull"" Here he comes... Oh! Oh! 'Cause he gets hit right in the nuts. Fall off. Shorts just fall right off. Exactly. All those ""famous last word"" people supposedly said? They're all made up. Like that patriotic dude, Nathan Hale, from third-grade history? You know what his real last words were? True story. So? It doesn't. That's true. Man, I always thought I had it rough not really knowing my dad, but... now I realize at least I'll never have to suffer like this. Our next video is called ""German Shepherd Activates Tennis Ball Cannon While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink."" And here's your phone number back. Yeah. Showing videos of guys getting hit in the nuts wasn't going to do anything. I'm just stupid. What we need to do is hit each other in the nuts. She's right. Your dad was hilarious. Hey, Mom. I'm ready to meet my dad."
1688,6,14,everyone ,"Yes. Yes. Yes, they were. We heard it. Loud and clear."
1689,6,14,judy ,"Thank you, Reverend. Wait... My last words with Marvin were lovely. I've been thinking about them a lot. ""Last words"" seems like a good theme. Marshall, do you remember the last thing your father said to you? Bye, sweetie. Bye, sweetie. You think your snobby New York cooking is better than mine-- admit it! Well, go ahead, Lily, why don't you just whip up a batch of your fancy tofu sushi bagels! And choke on them! I'm gonna go take a nap. Okay... okay, who is responsible for this? Who got Cousin Daphne drunk? She is 15 years old. What possible excuse could you have for this? There's nothing funny about getting minors drunk! You should be ashamed, Lily! Ashamed! Mmm! Oh, cripes, that's tasty. Mmm! Mmm! My last talk with Marvin was so lovely. And then he kissed me and he said... ""You know something, gorgeous, I'm the luckiest man alive."" Thanks. I know what you've been doing today. And I really needed it. That dress makes you look like a Kansas City whore. Sorry, dear. Last one."
1690,6,14,lily ,"Don't look at me. This morning Marshall said, ""I have to pee."" And I, ""Don't worry, baby, I'll do it for you."" Halfway through the pee, I'm, like, ""This doesn't even make sense!"" Marshall's mom hasn't eaten, slept or sat down since we got here. Wait! That can be my role! I'll take care of Judy! Okay, yes, Judy and I aren't besties, but today, whatever she needs, I'm there. I'm on Judy duty. Wow, you really do have everything in there, don't you? Yeah! It's positive racism! What is it? You have a voice mail from your dad? Baby, are you okay? Wait-- no, no, baby... Baby, I got it. Let me. Guys, listen to what just happened. Judy, do you need a break? I'm happy to cook for a while. Listen! Judy's finally sleeping and it's all because of me! Guys, I have a role: I'm Judy's bitch! Yeah! Yeah! Robin gave me a little orange pill from her purse. I don't know what's in it, but things are flowin' pretty smooth right now. We know, baby. But you'll always wonder, if you don't. Your dad loved you. It almost doesn't matter what he said. Hello. Fooled ya. Leave a message after the beep. We'll get back to ya. Beep. I did it. I'm from New York. We think getting minors drunk is funny. That salad's the first food she's eaten in two days. Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise and jelly beans, but it counts. You're up next, baby. Baby, are you okay? Hey, so it's a pocket dial. You have so many great memories with your dad. Who cares about the last one? Looks like your dad came through one last time. For what? Any time. Hi, Dad."
1691,6,14,lily's dad," Lily, it's Dad. Listen, I'm sort of in jail for not paying taxes for the last 25 years. ut bright side, I thought of a great new board game. ""Tax Evasion"", ages six to ten. Which is, ironically, what I might be looking at. Anyway, Pumpkin, I need $15,000."
1692,6,14,man ,"I, uh, I hear you're a woman who can get things. I need vodka and dirty playing cards."
1693,6,14,marshall ,"My dad's dead? Hey, guys, sorry, uh... I left my charger back in New York, so my phone's out of juice. Does anyone have...? Uh, outlet. Thank you. Oh... Your son? Guys... Trey Platt terrorized me growing up. He was, he was the toughest bully in school. Hello, Trey. Long time. Mm-hmm. I was not aware that you had become a reverend. Trey Platt. I can't believe my father's funeral service is being led by Trey ""The Noogie Machine"" Platt. He made me carry it. Bye, Mom. Yeah, Dad? I was gonna make a sandwich with that, Dad. Dad, don't they have food on the plane? ""Plane food is ass."" Those are the last words my father will ever say to me. Right after I denied the man a pork chop. Oh, God. Wait! I'm wrong! I'm wrong! That wasn't it! They couldn't find a cab so my dad called up from the street. And then, well, see, my dad grew up in a small town, in another generation, so sometimes - totally well-meaningly - he'd say stuff like... Dad... My dad's last words to me were a string of odd racial stereotypes. This is worse than the pork chop. No, wait-- I'm wrong. That wasn't it. They couldn't find a cab, so I went down there. Hey, you were right. The Kangs did, in fact, have an umbrella. Bye, Mom. Crocodile Dundee III is the second-best of the Croc trilogy, so maybe I can live with that. (cell phone beeps) Oh, sorry, my phone's charged. Oh, my God. I have a voice mail from my dad. My phone's been out of juice, so he must've called me the day the he, uh... I hold in my hand the last words my father will ever say to me. I'm gonna hit play. What if it's worse than Crocodile Dundee III? I can't do this. I can't... My mom is about to collapse. I'm gonna... I should go listen to this... alone, okay? I'll be back. I couldn't listen to it. Guys, this is hard. Guys, guys, what if-- God forbid-- all of your dads died right now? What would their last words to you have been? Seriously. How would you like those to be your father's last words? Lawyered. Lily? Lawyered. Robin? Lawyered. Now can we all just admit that last words are, in fact, a big deal? Barney, please, Barney! It's... No more videos, okay? I just need a minute. I'm not going to listen. ""Rent Crocodile Dundee II"" are the last words that my father will ever say to me, and I think I can live with that. I just need some air. I have to listen to it. It's a pocket dial. It's nothing. You guys don't get it, okay? None of you do. My dad was my hero. And he was my teacher. And he was my best friend. He always came through for me. And now he's just gone. And what am I left with? (scratchy electronic sounds) Thanks a lot, God! Thank you! You took my father, the greatest man that I have ever known, and you ripped him off this Earth, way too young! And he'll never get to meet our kids, Lily. (scratchy sounds continue) But we got this voice mail. Thank you so much for the voice mail! It's a great comfort! 'Cause whenever I'm starting to feel lonely or sad, or-- or you know what, or maybe a little bit cheated, at least I got the sound of his pocket to console me. How is this fair? You know, like, an entire human life and it just ends for no reason, and... and what are we left with? ""I love you."" My father's last words to me are ""I love you."" ""I love you."" My father's last words to me are ""I love you."" Bye, Pop. Then my father said the last words that he'll ever say to me: ""Rent Crocodile Dundee III. I caught it on the cable last night and it totally holds up."" Oh, man. I should have rented Crocodile Dundee III. Thanks. I'll be right back. And if I don't come back, well, then these are my last words to you all. I really, really, really love you guys. Now I'm going to go drop a deuce."
1694,6,14,marvin ,"Son, there's something I want to say before I leave. Could I snag that extra pork chop for the flight? Yeah, but plane food is ass. Marshall! Looks like rain out here! I couldn't find an umbrella in your closet! You know who probably has an umbrella? The Koreans across the hall! Hey, the Koreans are a trustworthy and generous people! I betcha one of the Koreans has an umbrella! Heck, they're Koreans! Of course they did. Hey, son, I just want to leave you with a little advice. Rent Crocodile Dundee III. I caught it on the cable last night. It totally holds up!"
1695,6,14,marvin's voice," Marshall? Oh, looks like I've been calling you for almost five minutes. How's my pocket sound? (laughing) Oh, sorry about that, buddy. Um, anyway, your mom and I had such a great time seeing you. I love you.  Ooh, and let me know if you find my foot cream. That fungus thing is acting up again."
1696,6,14,nathan hale, My I only regret is I have but one life to lose for my country.  I'm peeing my pants!
1697,6,14,reverend ,"I'm so sorry for your loss, Judy. Unfortunately, I can't. My daughter in Chicago just went into labor. But I'm leaving you in the capable hands of my second-in-command: my son. Oh, you remember Trey. I'll go grab him."
1698,6,14,robin ,"Well, uh, I've been to a couple funerals, so I know my role: I'm Vice Girl. Whatever Marshall needs to get through this day, I got it right here. Yeah, but doesn't Marshall's mom hate you--the fact that you two aren't very close? Really, guys? At a funeral? How? Outlet or USB? ""If""? Ted, the kids in that movie jumped into a painting and spent 15 minutes chasing a cartoon fox. ""Spoonful of sugar...""? Grow up. All that stuff was really nice! I've been known to locate certain objects from time to time. I got ya. How? What's wrong? You should listen to it. Just don't put too much pressure on it. The point is, last words are overrated. You heard right. (whispering: ) I'm getting a reputation. So, what you need, mama? Come here. Hey, stay hydrated. No, here's the awful part. You remembered my birthday! Whoa, they grow big out here. Judy, I... Doesn't hold a candle to your Crocodile Dundee thing. Hi, Dad."
1699,6,14,robin's dad," And so, despite the endless disappointment you've caused me, I pray that this will finally be the year you achieve something of actual significance. I'd love to stop lying to my friends about you being in a coma. Anyway, the point is, happy birthday, RJ."
1700,6,14,ted ,"This is the toughest time in Marshall's life and I feel absolutely useless. What can we do to help? Cigarettes, alcohol... Are these firecrackers? My God, Robin, you somehow crammed Tijuana into a purse. ""Judy duty."" Uh, okay, while not all of us possess your lofty sense of decorum, Drug-DealerFrom-An-'80s-After-School-Special, we have to laugh today. It's healthy. Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts. What about animals? You're like Mary Poppins, if her magic purse was also filled with drugs. Yeah! This video is entitled, ""Little League Coach Gets Hit in the Nuts by a Foul Ball and Then Vomits in a Garbage Can."" I don't wanna give anything away. Let's just watch. That guy gave you noogies? What, did he carry a stepladder? Let's see what happens. And then the fat kid loses his swim trunks. She's right. I mean, this idea that someone's last words have to be profound and meaningful? I mean, who can live up to that? Look, think of it this way: you get to hear your dad's voice one last time. Whoa. Are you okay? Well, but this day is tough on you, too. You sure you can absorb all that? I know mine. When I was in Cleveland last month, I went to visit my dad at his... post-divorce bachelor pad. Yeah... so glad we can we can talk about our s*x lives now. That's totally an improvement. My prom date?! I have to go. Well, they might be. Donna Bromstead's husband is a cop. That's awful. Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Marshall laugh once. Stupid. Yes. Nothing beats the immediacy of live theater. But which one of us is going to take the hit?(Barney hits Ted in the nuts) So that's it? No discussion? Is he laughing? These stories suck. Okay, seriously, how are you doing that? Hi, Dad."
1701,6,14,ted's dad," Been fun bro-ing out with you tonight, T-Dawg.  I hooked up with a younger woman the other week-- Donna Bromstead.  How far did you get, T-Dawg?"
1702,6,14,trey ,"'Sup Marshall. Yeah, well, your lunch money finally ran out. Kidding! So, my dad has these questions he asks to help create a theme for the service, or whatever. Question one: ""What were your last words with the deceased?"" Lame. Question two: Well, this is clearly yielding nothing. Thanks, Dad. Guess I'll have to fill the time with some jokes... again."
1703,6,14,woman ,"Hey, so, um, I heard you might have..."
1704,6,14,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when your best friend loses someone... Ted from 2030:...you drop everything and rush to his side only to find yourself standing there with no idea what to do or say. Robin, hushing: Be cool, nerds! Ted, whispering: Sweet save. Barney & Ted: Oh! Ted:...right in the nuts, Barney & Ted: The fat kid just runs away. Marshall's brother #1: Me, too. We went for a hike in the snow and had this amazing talk. Marshall's brother #2: My last day with Pop, he taught my son how to skate. Ted from 2030: Marshall really did think he could live with that. That is, until later, at the memorial service. Ted from 2030: The stories his mother and brothers told were so perfect. Marshall's brother #1: Then he picked my crying son up off the ice. He gave him a hug and said, ""Champ, it doesn't matter if you fall down once in a while."" Marshall's brother #2: And as we hiked, a little deer appeared on the path. She hopped over to Dad and started eating-- right out of his hand. Marshall's brother #1: ""I will always be proud of you"""" Marshall's brother #2: ""Life is such a gift."" Barney, his voice breaking: Lame. Ted from 2030: So Marshall finally got up to speak. Funny thing, though... Ted from 2030: He decided to keep Marvin's real last words just for himself. Ted from 2030: Last words-- it's a lot of pressure, kids."
1705,6,15,barney ,"I hope I can pass this hot dog. Oh, honey. Why do they call 'em coasters? Ted, a word. God, I hate these situations. What are we gonna do about this? Come on, Ted, it's obvious. Honey's vibing on me. It's called body language. Remember when she was touching your arm and leaning in real close? Well, while that was happening, the straw in her drink was pointed right at me. I mean... that's as clear as a signal gets, so... I'm so sorry, man. Does anyone know why we're here? Guys, just let the man explain how it's all about his wearing a lady's watch. Hey, Marshall. I'm up on burners, playa. Too many crazies had my old number, so now I'm all about disposable cell phones. I'll use one for a while, have my fun, then dump it and get a new one. And then I'll do the same with my phone. Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story. I'll tell you that story. That is exactly how it happened. So Ted did his best to impress her, but as per yoozh, he bored the pants very much on her. Anyway, I get Honey back to her place. Who's your daddy? Sure, I'll just summarize it. (imitating squeaky bedsprings) Only way I know how. Any-who, next day, I'm going into work. I run into Zoey. Hey, Zoey. That cousin of yours... Honey... yowsa! I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts. Yeah, we had a great time last night. And then just hand stuff in the morning, so... Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize... (imitating squeaky bedsprings) She hugged me. What was that all about? Who's your daddy? So I wrote him a letter. And I poured my heart out. And I gave him my number and I told him to call me. And he still hasn't called me. I mean, I shouldn't be surprised. Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me. I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son. Four. Four Nobel Prizes. Only three."
1706,6,15,honey ,"Hey, Zoey. Honey. My apartment building is so safe. My landlord... he even installed a security camera in my shower. Maybe I should feel weird about giving a stranger my Social Security number, but the guy's a Nigerian prince. I just had a great TV audition. Behind the KFC where the executive producer works on the weekends. Long story short, I'm going to be on Lost. Yeah, I always get those e- mails from Michelle Obama and sometimes Obama himself. Wow, an architect. How fascinating. Okay, time to go home. Hey, Zoey. Honey. Wow, an architect. How fascinating. Okay, time to go home. Hi. I spent the night with your friend Barney and he accidentally left his phone in my apartment, in the garbage. But I've been going through all of his contacts because I'm sure he wants to get in touch with me. After all, he told me, uh... I was his first. Hi. Oh, yeah. He's such a sweet guy. I guess he recently decided to get in touch with his dad. His mom gave him the guy's address. Oh, honey. Oh, honey. Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you. He's ashamed of himself. I mean, look at you. You're do so great without him. I mean, you have an airline and three Nobel Prizes, and you play for the Yankees. Four. See? That is impressive. I mean, how many does he have? Well, there you go. Oh, I can't tell you about that. The only people that are allowed to know are me, Zoey and her therapist. Oh! Well, in that case..."
1707,6,15,judy ,"He's gay! I'm sorry. Oh, my God! Sorry. Marshall, I'm going to Byerly's. You want anything? Of course, dear."
1708,6,15,lily ,"Yeah, and it's not like you can screw up a hot dog. Oh, God. This is so good. I'm gonna finish it in the bathroom. Yeah, who called this intervention? Finally. Are you sure it's love? Harsh? Robin, a single guy and a married woman cannot be friends if one's in love with the other. And seriously, mouthwash after coffee. We hate Ted now. Get on board or the sexting stops. Oh, I know. But did he tell you the whole story? That's crazy. I don't hate you. He... Oh, really? And-And what did Ted say, exactly? Oh, he... Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay, well, I- I guess there's no use hiding it anymore. I- I hate you. Bitch. I don't know. Not entirely. Zoey, wait! I don't hate you! We just can't be friends anymore because... Robin hates you. Oh, well, I'll let you take that. Love you, baby!"
1709,6,15,marcus ,"Zoey's in love with Ted. Wait, hear me out, Marshall. Zoey's in love with Ted, but she's married, so she tried to push him away by setting him up with her cousin instead. But seeing Ted and Honey hit it off was more than her gentle heart could bear, so Zoey left early, pricked by love's fickle thorn. But then, the next morning, upon learning that Ted had not tasted of Honey's sweet nectar, her joy burst forth like a blossoming flower in spring. Oh, Marshall, I stopped by that new doughnut shop Hertz Donuts. Would you like a Hertz Donut? Hurts, don't it? I can't believe you fell for that, bro. Could you get some more Bugles, please? Zoey's in love with... So help me, Marshall, if you don't call those two crazy, mixed-up kids, I will."
1710,6,15,marshall ,"Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking. No. It's called manners, jerk. Now, what's-what's going on in New York? Give me something. Robin, I just want you to know, it's either this story you're telling me or another game of Clue against myself, so make it good. Interesting. Show your work. Oh, honey. Oh, honey. Oh, honey. Oh, honey. Mom, hang up! Go on. Oh, my God. Mom! Ted's in love with Zoey? But, but she's married. That boy needs an intervention. Marcus! This is a private conversation! So what'd the wuss do next? Oh, um, that's my other line. It's not a number I recognize. Yeah. Well, it would be. Good-bye. Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking. Barney. W- What number is this? Hey, uh, so Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing. Uh... Robin's version was... Okay, can we skip this part, please? Okay, that's been going on a while. Marcus! Wow. Zoey's in love with Ted. Sure. Hey, where's the...? No! Aah! So Ted's in love with Zoey and Zoey's in love with Ted? Well, that-that's not going to work. I got to call Ted. Listen, Ted, um, I got to tell you something about Zoey. Mom! Get off the phone! Marcus, hang up! Both of you, hang up! And we need ice cream. Go on. Oh. Hey, buddy, that's Lily. I should take that. But, uh, you're a good guy, Ted. Hey, baby. Ted's a son of a bitch! (cell phone chirps) Oh, nice. But, hey, um, baby, go easy on Ted, okay? He just, he just ended things with Zoey. Difficult stuff? What difficult stuff? Well, you did the right thing, baby. And that's Robin on the other line. Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking... Listen, Robin. I know. I apologize for my wife. She never should have... Me? You dragged me into this?! Oh, God, that's my other line. Oh, God, it's a 917 number, and I don't recognize it! I think it's Zoey! I can't not answer. It's impolite. I can't turn my back on politeness. Good manners are what separate us from those ""elbows on the table"" Wisconsinites. I'm sorry, Robin! Eriksen residence. Marshall speaking. Oh, honey. Oh! Honey! Zoey's cousin. Listen, um, about Barney... Hey, uh, listen, Honey, while I've got you, do you have any idea what kind of difficult stuff Zoey's been going through? I am her therapist. Uh, okay, listen, I think we've made great progress for today. I got to go. Bye. Mom! Marcus! So we got Ted and Zoey. Ted is in love with Zoey. Zoey has no idea. Then Zoey's cousin Honey went home with Barney, and Zoey was happy about it. Which tells us what? Zoey's in love with Ted and Ted doesn't know. So Ted and Zoey... they're in love with each other, which would be fine if Zoey wasn't married to Colonel Mustard. I mean, The Captain. Except now, as Honey informs me... Zoey and The Captain are getting divorced. Which means...? Give me that phone. They're kissing?! Yeah! (screams) They're kissing!"
1711,6,15,neighbour ,They're kissing.
1712,6,15,robin ,"There is one thing that's been going on. Uh, it's about Ted... and Zoey. I thought the oven was Celsius. Oh, it's good. You see, after that night, none of us heard from Zoey for a while. Finally, Ted called her up. She is a lovely person... warm, intelligent, just kind of gullible. It's like, every word out of her mouth makes you want to be like, ""Oh, honey."" I know. You just want to wrap her up in a blanket and give her a cup of tea. She's, like, this little lost lamb who needs to be protected from the wolves. Speaking of whom... So the night went on, and eventually everyone went home, except for Ted and Honey. And Barney. Good for you. Ted Mosby does not take advantage of poor, helpless honeys. Hmm? Hmm? Funny you should say that. Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair. Isn't that a little harsh? Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now, too. It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her. She'll always be around. Okay, just shut it down. Okay, just ignore your feelings. If-If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self. Look, I like Zoey. Without her, my dinner party wouldn't have been such a success. So those feelings of yours... shut 'em down. So don't answer it. Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her. You just went through a tragedy. It's not like she's gonna call you up and... Just don't answer it. Marshall, you can beat this. You don't have to answer. You can just let it ring. You can do this. I believe in you. Don't do it, Marshall!"
1713,6,15,ted ,"It's okay. We got hot dogs. Well, looks like someone's going out in the cold to get more ketchup. Which is all gone. Hmm, tell you what... no dice. You're not getting out of this. I'll get the ketchup. So are we ever gonna see you again? Because, if I recall correctly, you owe me a date with your hot cousin. Yes. And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going. Hi, Honey, I'm Ted. What are you talking about? What? Mm-hmm. You're right. She's all yours, buddy. I'd say hump her brains out, but someone obviously already has. Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her. Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her. I'm in love with Zoey. I did. It's for me. This is about the coffee breath. It's because I'm in love with Zoey, and she's married, so it needs to stop. And... intervene. Remember the ketchup bottle? She wasn't the one who dropped it. When she reached for it, our fingers touched, and...(glass shatters) I knew, right in that moment, this isn't friendship. This is love. This is love. And this was my grandmother's watch. Anyway, now I have only one course of action in front of me: I have to end my friendship with Zoey. Then what am I supposed to do? Fine. I'll shut 'em down. Blah, blah, blah, I'm an architect. Blah, blah, blah, I don't wear suits. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Rambling architecture anecdote. Blah, blah, something about a bridge. Blah, blah, blah... Hello. Yeah, yeah. I need to tell you something about Zoey, too. Can I get you a beer? I, uh... I can't be friends with you anymore. And this may seem strange, but... you can't ask me why. And that was it. No more Zoey. I, uh, I can't be friends with you anymore. And you can't ask me why. Lily hates you. Lily hates you. She hates you so much it's hard to be around you. So we can't be friends. I told you. Lily hates you. All right. Yes. I... hate you. Zoey. And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going. Why do I hate you? Are you kidding? Uh, you're actively trying to prevent me from realizing a lifelong dream. So there's that. Plus, you're stubborn and-and-and argumentative. And what kind of name is Zoey, huh? What is that, short for Zoseph? (cell phone ringing) Go on, get it. I'll have more in a second. Why was Marshall calling? You talk during movies. You-You-You sneeze with your whole body. Uh, to my knowledge, you do not speak Portuguese. You're a show-off. Uh, hey, Marshall, can I call you back? I'm out in the hallway with... She is? She is? Marshall, I got to go."
1714,6,15,zoey ,"Could someone pass the ketchup? Oh.Oops. Oh, come on, man, I brought the wine. All right, I tell you what... you get this one bottle, I'll get the next three. I'll get the next hundred. You want to go on a date with my hot cousin? Hello. You still want to do that? Don't worry, Ted, she's cute. She's not fat. Oh, here she is. Hey. Ted, this is my cousin... Ted, this is my cousin... Thanks. Wait, she didn't go home with Ted? Hey. I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd take you up on that beer you're about to offer me. Oh, Ted, I'm so busy. But I guess I got time for one. Lead the way. What?! Fridge full of ketchup? How? How, I ask you? What? Wow. Okay. Why? You hate me? Well, I know that's not true, Lily. Ted told me everything. I can't believe it. I really thought you and I were friends. Lord knows I could use a friend right now. I've been going through some pretty difficult stuff. What's this really about? I think you hate me. I think you have some big problem with me, and you're too chicken to come out and say it. Great. See? Was that so hard? Can you at least tell me why? Because I'm racking my brain here, and I thought... I just want to know why. Fine, I will, uh, make it happen. Good-bye. Okay. Well... I guess I'll take it. Hello. Oh, hey, Marshall...Yes, I am...Yes, I am...He is?...Bye. Don't worry about it. Go on. Well, actually... (speaking Portuguese) You better take that."
1715,6,15,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, after Uncle Marshall lost his father, he decided to stay home a while to take care of his mother. (phone ringing) But the longer he stayed there, the more it was like he had never left Minnesota. Robin, laughing: Oh, that is too cute. Say it again. Ted from 2030: Kids, remember. Zoey had tried to save an old building from being torn down and replaced by a new building that I'd been hired to design. And yet somehow, despite this, we had all managed to become friends. Which brings us to the night Aunt Robin decided to cook dinner. Barney, coughing: ""Cute"" means ""fat"""" Barney, coughing: ""Not fat"" means ""ugly"""" Barney, coughing: I take back everything I said. That girl is extremely attractive. Ted from 2030: Kids, to be honest, I don't quite remember this girl's name. None of us do, because as this story has been told and retold, we've always just referred to her as... Ted from 2030: And here's why... Robin, with a Minnesotan accent: Oh, my God, you are so Minnesota. You can't not answer the phone because it would be rude. Honey, whispering: Straw. Barney, whispering: Coaster. Ted, laughing: Oh, my God. Ted:Listen, Zoey, I, um... I need to tell you something. Um... Honey, giggling: Oh... Who's your daddy? Barney, sobbing: I don't know."
1716,6,16,anna ,"Bev, you look at me. It's not a stupid idea. Tonight, we are queens. Those guys are gonna buy us hot dogs at Grey's Papaya. Look, Robin, you'll find someone, too. You're a queen. You've got so much to offer. Maybe do something with that hair."
1717,6,16,arnold schwarzenegger," If it bleeds, we can k*ll it."
1718,6,16,barney ," You're doing this all wrong! Ted, there are couples in my kindergarten class who have moved faster than you two. Granted, their home lives are not great.  Total booty-call.  Wow, you sound really lonely.  Shh. Daddy's talking now. Loneliness. The looming specter of Valentine's Day fast approaching. The two key ingredients to my favorite day of the year, February 13: Desperation Day.  It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death.  Wait, there's more.  And right by Saint Valentine's side was his best bro, Saint Desperatius, there to pick off insecure bridesmaids.  Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day. That neediness reaches its climax... what up... on February 13. A magical night when a ten has the self-esteem of a four and the depraved enthusiasm of a two. Now, there's only one thing you can't do.  Wherever you are, or whoever you're under, you must get home alone by 11:59 p.m. Otherwise, you're on a date on Valentine's Day.  Trolls.  Lying trolls. You losing your mind, being alone in your apartment?  We said you were going to have s*x. We didn't say, ""Bring a carry-on.""  God, these girls are so hungry for male attention. It is like being a hunter and having the deer walk up, tie itself to the hood of your car and beg to get mounted.  Enchanté. That's French for ""What's with the purple?""  Please! You might as well be dog-earing a tear-stained bridal magazine while wolfing down the box of chocolates you had delivered to yourself at work from your ""fiancé"" who no one's ever met.  Okay, when your ""fiancé"" Gerard comes back from fixing cleft palates in Peru, maybe snatch a photo of the two of you together, and then I'll totally believe you.  My elbow slipped!  So, you were an Olympic gymnast?  Ooh, sorry. Gold's the only thing that really counts.  And she sticks the landing. Why don't you start stretching, and I'll... be right back. Hey, hey, sorry.  Quick question.  Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends?  Sure.  Oh, my gosh! Me, too! Um, is it getting crowded in here, 'cause I think there are two peas in this pod?  Guilty. This is embarrassing but every year, I buy flowers and a box of chocolates, even if I'm not with someone. Just in case, you know?  The worst.  What's that?  All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13... a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate.  Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie.  Here's the first thing you need to know about laser tag. ...became the 2010 Tri-County Champions.  Oh, it is. Plus, if you win, you get free pizza. This is my teammate for tomorrow.  I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news.  What? No, don't go! You want to see a magic trick?!  What are you talking about?  No, I don't. She's gross.  Whatever you say.  Nora...  The ground was shaking like. Robin, where are you? Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot since last year. They're terrifying!  Hap...?  Oh!"
1719,6,16,bev ,"I use, uh, colors to express emotion. Purple is for pride. It was a stupid idea. Gerard is real! Well, he's going to Kenya after Peru, so... So, we're taking off. But tomorrow's Valentine's Day."
1720,6,16,judy ,"This is such a nice surprise. Marshall will be so happy. Oh, I'm doin' okay. It gets a little lonely. My friends suggested a body pillow, but...(chuckles) I'm not a lunatic. Oh, they're upstairs, sweetie. Right next to your washed and folded clothes. Aw... Anything for my baby bear. Get him out of my house. Take Marshall back to New York with you. Please, I am begging you. Well, he was, at first. But once he saw me starting to do better, he kind of regressed. He's been holed up in his room for days at a time, playing old video games. I mean, he is having a pretty sick Dr. Mario run, but... I want to be there for him, but it's like he's a teenager again. I even walked in on him abusing himself. There he was, on the bed, looking at old photos of his dad. That's emotional self-abuse, don't you think? Oops. Comin' right up! Anything else, sweetie? Heavens to Bess, no! Of course not! Oh, if Marshall could stay here forever, I would be the happiest mom in Minnesota. Is orange juice okay?"
1721,6,16,lily ,"Private Booty, reporting for duty. It's called class, Ted. Are you kidding? You're in the kitchen, it's getting hot, you start licking stuff off each others' fingers. Before you know it, she's bent over the marble island, and you're spanking her with a rubber spatula. And she's screaming, ""Stop, Marshall, stop,"" but that's just code for ""harder!"" So long! And now he's staying even longer. His mom has been having a really hard time since the funeral. He's waiting on her hand and foot. But... it's Valentine's Day. It's not going to be the same without the two of us watching Predator together. I'm so glad none of those girls were right for you. I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears... I decided to go to Minnesota to see Marshall. He shouldn't have to help his mom through this rough time all by himself. I'm getting weird! See, it started off with me throwing Marshall's jersey on my body pillow. And, well, things kind of spiraled from there. I'm sorry I yelled like that before. I call him ""Marshpillow."" And he calls me... nothing because he's a pillow. You brought an overnight bag? How are you holding up, Judy? I wanted to surprise you. I thought he was here helping you. Uh, I'll talk to him. Oh, God. Um, Marshall, your mom asked me to carry this up. She turned her ankle on your Hot Wheels. Is my track okay? It's fine, but, Marshall, I thought you were here taking care of your mom. It seems like she's taking care of you. Marshall, tomorrow's Valentine's. Don't you want to be at home on our couch, cuddling up under a warm blanket, watching the Predator use his heat vision to stalk helpless prey? Marshall, your mom wants you out of here. But, Judy, you said... Ted... I thought you were going to talk to Marshall about coming back to New York. Marshall, I'm going home. I'm flying out tonight before the big storm, and I want you to come with me. While I'm sure it's been really helpful for her to have you here playing Super Mario Kart for 14 hours a day... But your mom doesn't need you. Your life in New York needs you. It needs you really bad. Please come home soon. Baby, you're back. We both knew this would end eventually."
1722,6,16,marshall ,"You know, I saw this in the theater, like, five times, but I never got to see it with the right girl. What girls? Hey, Mom? I hate to be that guy, but I'm pretty sure it was Hot Pocket o'clock, like, ten minutes ago. Lily. What are you doing here? Oh, my gosh. That's so sweet. I'm so glad you're here. Hey, um, before I forget, Mom, did you remember to get more double-A batteries? Oh, great, okay. I don't want my Game Boy to crap out. I'm having the sickest Dr. Mario run of my life. Okay. I'll be right back. I love you, Lily. Okay. You're the best, Mom. My mom loves to feel needed. Letting her take care of me is how I'm taking care of her. She's in a dark place, Lily. She needs this. Mom? You forgot my chocolate milk with the swirly straw! Well, baby, we could watch Predator here. No, my mom can go rent it for us after she's done digging out the car. What? Mom, d-do you want me to leave? What? I can't right now, 'cause my mom needs me. Hell, yeah. Baby, don't go. I miss my dad, Ted. I miss him so much. Um, when I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula. And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till, like, the middle of the night. And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything. Thanks a lot for coming out here, man. Hey, are-are you sure it's okay with Zoey that you're here for Valentine's Day? What? You're not taking a step back. You're running away. And hiding out here, hiding out here is not gonna solve anything. You're just holed up in Minnesota because you're too scared to face reality, and it's... We got to go back to New York, tonight. So, we drive. It's time. It's time to get back to real life. It's time to grow up. Yeah Mom! Can you make us some PB and J's for the road? Crusts cut off! No, Ted. What are we...? We're men. Mom! Leave the crusts on! They forced their opponents to scatter, picking them off, one by one, in a swift and merciless slaughter. Happy Valentine's Day, Lily Pad. Oh."
1723,6,16,marvin ,"Here's a secret. I couldn't see worth a damn, either, buddy. I just kept driving forward, hoping for the best. Look out! Gotcha."
1724,6,16,nora ,"Hey, guys, so sorry I'm late. Oh, hi. Yeah. Oh, I told them I forgot, but the truth is, I'm kind of protesting their protest. Can you keep a secret? I love Valentine's Day. Oh, you're a gooey romantic, too? We are pitiful. Although there is one difference between you and me. I'm not saying any of this to get in your pants. What's desperate about knowing what you want? Look, life is really short, Barney. Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone, distracting yourself from the fact that nobody loves you with some sad little activity? I have no idea what any of those words mean. Wow. Laser tag sounds brilliant! Where are Bev and Anna? Well, I think I'm heading out, too. It's late, and I have a date with my pillow. I mean, not literally. I'm not a lunatic. Boy Scout Troop 15 doesn't stand a chance. Bye. Hey, Barney. Robin told me to meet you guys here. You will be avenged."
1725,6,16,robin ," Oh. Translation: booty-call.  Guys booty-call girls after 2:00 a.m. with a drunkenly slurred, ""What ya doing?"" But when a lady booty-calls a guy, she invents a respectable excuse to mask the fact that she wants to get stuck real good.  That's not a thing.  Please say ""widows.""  Barney, Desperation Day assumes that all single women freak out about Valentine's Day. Which we do not. Case in point, I will be spending February 13 with some lovely single ladies from work... ...who could care less about Valentine's Day.  And we will be celebrating the fact that we don't have to spend it with some dippy guy carting around roses and stuffed toys all night. Oh, no offense, Ted.  Hey. How was ""baking cookies"" last night?  So how did Zoey react?  Were there slippers for the morning?  Yeah, if you say so, yeah.  Look, she just got out of a marriage, Ted. That's heavy. I'm kind of freaking out, just listening to you. My heart is pounding, I'm hearing this weird clicking noise.  See, that just amps up the pressure even more. Boy, it's a good thing that you're sure.  Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex.  Well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and everything is pink and red, so Bev very thoughtfully suggested that we wear purple to show how little we care.  And we don't care about some stupid, sexist, corporate holiday.  Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna beat him in an arm wrestle?  Oh, yeah, I agreed to that.  Well...  What?  What...? So that's it? A couple of white Urkels offer you sausages, and you're gone? What about the sisterhood? Solidarity? The color purple?  I thought we didn't care about Valentine's Day.  Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day...  Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora.  Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain.  Oh, hey, Nora.  Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day."
1726,6,16,saint desperatius, Whoa. Check out that one. Her body is a perfect X.  And I thought Pompeii was smokin'.

1728,6,16,schwarzenegger ,Come on! Come on! k*ll me! I'm here! k*ll me!
1729,6,16,ted ,"Look, um... I know you're going through a lot right now. Getting divorced, being single, figuring out who you are on your own. I just mean... I'm okay taking this slow. I want to do this right. Hey, I'm trying. I keep suggesting these big, romantic dates, and she keeps putting on the brakes. Like tonight, she wants me to just come over and bake cookies. That's crazy. She-She wants to bake. Wait. That... You think that's what she means by ""baking cookies""? Marshall's been in Minnesota a while, huh? That's actually true. This won't be. And none was taken until just then. You guys said I was definitely going to spend the night. She thought it was presumptuous and asked me to leave. It's-It's not like I brought a ton of stuff. Not slippers, exactly. They're called British morning socks. Listen, that was a dumb move for me to just assume... We totally did. They're actually called British morning socks. Right. Okay. Yeah. You know, there's this new Italian restaurant on 79th that's supposed to be amazing. Tomorrow night, my place. Isn't that great? What do you mean? Well, it's romantic, right? Zoey and I are getting serious on Valentine's Day. Who said I wasn't sure? I'm glad we're in a serious relationship. Right away. And if I screw this up, I'm the devil, because she's going through a divorce. But I'm not going to screw this up. So stop freaking out, Robin. Stop freaking out! Hi! I'm here to help Marshall. Yeah, but, you know, things move so fast in New York. Why not hang out here until at least after Valentine's Day. Plus, we're helping Marshall's mom. Uh, Mrs. Eriksen, we're running low on SunnyD! You have Super Mario Kart?! I know. Yeah. Well, I mean, technically, she doesn't know yet. Things with Zoey are moving really fast, and the divorce just makes everything more complicated. I just, I needed to take a step back. We're snowed in. Lily got the last flight. Crusts cut off. Well, that was kind of presumptuous."
1730,6,16,woman ,"Oh, Jupiter, what are your plans for me? 15 and still unmarried. Silver medal. That's what my dad said. Hey, I'm all stretched out!"
1731,6,16,zoey ,"Someone knows how to set a mood. Uh... Is that an overnight bag? No, no, I overreacted. I mean, I invited you over to ""bake cookies."" We both knew what that meant. I just, you know... I saw those slippers in your bag, and suddenly everything felt really serious. And... ever since, I've been asking myself, ""Am I ready for this?"" And... the answer is ""yes."" Yeah. Don't get in your own way. So Valentine's Day is tomorrow. I would be happier having just a simple, home-cooked meal. As long as it's with you. I'm ready for this, Ted. I am in it for the long haul. I can't wait for our first Valentine's Day as a couple. The one we'll remember for years. Really? An overnight bag for your own living room? Looks like we got a matching set."
1732,6,16,,"Ted from 2030: My first kiss with Zoey was amazing, and complicated. Ted from 2030: My friends, as usual, were completely supportive. Ted from 2030: I should explain. On their very first Valentine's Day, Marshall and Lily set out to watch Sleepless in Seattle. Ted from 2030: Except Marshall's brothers had taped over it with Predator. And it became a tradition. Ted from 2030: That was a tough question. You see... Marshall, whispers: She needs this. Ted from 2030: Kids, I'm not super proud of what I did next. Ted from 2030: Meanwhile, as Desperation Day turned into Desperation Night... Ted & Marshall: No! Ted from 2030: And so we drove through the night, out of Desperation Day and into Valentine's. And there was no trace of my little freak out, except... Ted from 2030: And that's how, for the first time in his life, Barney Stinson wound up on a date on Valentine's Day."
1733,6,17,arthur ,"Okay, I've heard enough. Don't we already have a green initiative? I mean, didn't we do a whole thing? Hang a banner, make a video, Sting was there. I thought I met Sting. Yeah, I met Sting. So why on Earth would we spend another $12 million? Yeah, but I met Sting. Who here supports Eriksen's proposal? Meeker, you're fired! And as for you, Eriksen..."
1734,6,17,barney ,"I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster. You want to grab a drink right now? Absolutely. She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well... You want to grab a drink right now? Absolutely. It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids. What? Nora? No, I don't. That's... Nora. Sorry, sorry. I was thinking of a funny thing that Nora said. Hmm. Stop it. No... ra. Nah... Damn it, what is the matter with me? Call her? she had a nice face, her booty was in place, but Barney don't chase. Totally. Like Prince. Oh. Ha-wink Lily, in my travels, I've developed a finely calibrated sense of how long it's been since... How do I not put this delicately?... a girl's been porked. And, boo, you've been pork-free so long, you're practically kosher. Five weeks, three days by my estimation. I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds. 18 weeks. Shh. Child, listen. If you're really hurting for it, I'd be more than happy to throw you one. We're exes. We're probably due for a backslide. Or we could just do it the normal way. Yeah? Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my shot? What? But ""L'Amour"" means love! They're going to the cafe of love! I'm fine. It's fine. Point is, Robin, I don't even like Nora. Damn it! Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is ""$12 million,"" and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance. You lying little minx. I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight from 5:00 p.m. until closing, reading a newspaper with two holes cut out of it, and I never saw Nora or this Italian race car driver she's dating. Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver. No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite! No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great pen1s comes great responsibility. Sorry? Careful, Robin, I'll do it. Don't poke the dragon, Robin, 'cause the dragon will poke you back. All right, Robin, give it to me. The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine? A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five? How am I supposed to see that's a five? Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make."
1735,6,17,captain ,"Ted. What a surprise. Ted. Once upon a time, Zoey and I were happy. Blissful as Arcadian shepherds. I was Poseidon, she my Amphitrite. I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis could not have torn us asunder. We had great big boners for each other. But then... enter the scoundrel. I don't know what he looks like, but I picture him with a mustache. Anyway, soon the inevitable happened. She told me she was in love with someone else. Obviously, it made me angry. But I gathered my composure, and told her I'd do anything to keep her. I begged her not to leave. We made love that night. But morning came, and she was gone. I don't blame myself. Hmm? There's only one man I blame for this. Hello, Ted. To the study! Mmm. Ted... I know. I know who stole my Zoey. No man likes to be betrayed, especially by a friend. You can imagine then how painful it was when I learned that the name of my betrayer is... Ted... when I tell you who it is, you're gonna... It's my doorman! He always winks and tips his hat when he sees her. I know how these things work. He holds her package, and pretty soon, she's holding his. And then there's his glorious mustache. I will have him fired for this! You're right. Maritime protocol demands physical retribution! Who is this flower child, and what has he done with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?! Whoa, ""rapscallion"" may be going a bit far, Ted. Why couldn't she just like boats? Just to have one thing in common? Other girls like boats, don't they? When you put it that way, I should almost thank the doorman. It doesn't, it really doesn't. It doesn't."
1736,6,17,lily ,"Yeah, he's been really... quiet. No, it's more than that. It's like, all the stuff he used to love, he suddenly has no interest in anymore. Excuse me? It's been a while. You should work at a carnival. Yeah, I'll walk out with you guys. Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed? Mmm. Anything I can do to help you with that? Man, I am losing my touch. Is it over? I call on top. Oh, that's too bad, 'cause I was going to make a little presentation of my own. Deal. Come on, come on. s*x now, we'll do the foreplay after. No, sweetie, just-just put all that out of your mind and relax. Look, I got you a six-pack of tall boys from the deli. Yeah? Oh, I-I don't know. I threw them down the garbage chute. Let's just use the handcuffs instead. Marshall, right now, I don't give a wat's ass about Garbage Island. Cwap. Okay, baby, what gives? I hope this doesn't make me look desperate. Okay, Marshall, seriously, what's going on? What do you mean? Are you avoiding sleeping with me 'cause you don't want to start a family? Marshall, if you want to quit your job and go work for the NRDC right now, then you need to do that right now. And then, once you've cleaned up all the oceans and saved the planet... you know, like, a year from now... then we'll start a family. Meeker doesn't hate you."
1737,6,17,man ,You did meet Sting. His father just died.
1738,6,17,marshall ,"All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big meaningless stack of paperwork that I have to get off my desk to make room for tomorrow's big meaningless stack of paperwork. But it's all worth it, you know, 'cause at least I know I'm making the world a... place. All right, see you guys later. I can't sleep. Maybe after this documentary on garbage. I have to save the planet! Garbage Island. You haven't heard of Garbage Island? It's an island... made of garbage! It's in the Pacific Ocean. It's twice the size of Texas! Guys, I'm going environmental, okay? Phase one: the bar. I've already convinced MacLaren's to implement a new green initiative. You're welcome... Earth. Phase two: GNB. Tomorrow I'm going to make a presentation in front of the board about how we can cut our carbon footprint by half for only $12 million. Baby, baby, I really got to work on this presentation. Okay, why not: from now until tomorrow afternoon, I do this, and then tomorrow night, I do that. Lily! Oh, no, baby, come on. Today didn't go so well. The green initiative, for only $12 million, will change the way... Well, because we can always do more. Well, meeting Sting isn't gonna fix anything, Arthur! Meeker got fired because of me. I'm the bad guy. Hey, baby. What happened to the plastic rings that held the six-pack together? Baby, birds can get caught in those and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish! Weren't you listening? Don't you care about Garbage Island? Well, I do. I got to find those rings! I'm sorry, but neither of us are getting any action until I find those rings. He'll never get to see how I turn out. My dad. You know, I used to, um, I used to always tell him that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer. And he was always so proud of me for that. But he never got to see the version of me that was anything but a corporate stooge. And now it's too late. And we're starting a family, you know. Lily, if we have a baby right now, that is just it for me. The cement will dry, and I will be stuck at GNB forever. I don't know. So far, in the name of saving the planet, I've ruined your night, I practically broke Wendy's back and I got Meeker fired. The guy must hate me. Hey, Ted."
1739,6,17,meeker ,"Well, he has some good points. Are you guys...? Rough night? I'm sorry. What did you just say? Know him? I hate that guy. Well, hey."
1740,6,17,nora ,"Oh, my God, this was so much fun. We have to do this again. We do, we have to. No, I'm kind of tired. But... this is my number. Give me a call. No, I'm kind of tired."
1741,6,17,robin ,"So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag. Not according to her. How is that a disaster? Please, Cheese. You like this girl. Barney, you can't say her name without smiling. You like her. You should call her. That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice. Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man. Good night. Good night, guys. Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and... Throw me one? Yeah. Oh, I see what's going on. This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your shot. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care. Nora met a guy. What?! Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night. In other words, one-eighth the size of Canada. So... Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero. Sorry. Who said anything about an...? No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten. You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship. Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one. I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve. Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place. Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, ""Yeah, Barney, go get her!"" But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you. It's a five, idiot. ""Moon man language""? What does that even mean? Look how you taped this up... Barney. Go get her."
1742,6,17,ted ,"Yes, I realize it's raining, but, come on, it's 2021. We can make cell phones that project holograms, but a light drizzle shuts down a whole airport? Hey... There she is. Wow. Wendy the Waitress! I was just saying-- what are you doing here? No, it's a cute story. Once upon a time... Zoey was married to this super rich, super creepy guy called The Captain. So when Zoey and I became friends, I was careful not to cross any lines. I know, right? But then one day, Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight. He flipped out and demanded a divorce. And she was heartbroken. But after a little soul-searching, she ended up back in my and the rest, as they say, is history. Oh. A little cold. Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain. I mean this in a super manly way. That guy scares the panties off me. If it's really important to you, I will pick it up tomorrow. I'm worried about Marshall. He doesn't seem like himself lately. Anyway, we should get going. I'm here to... Captain. I... Pssh, nah... Guys, I got a problem. I ran into The Captain. Wow. Yes! Limit the search to guys with mustaches. Smart. And that's the last time you saw her. That's damn good brandy. Oh, Captain... don't blame yourself. Me. I'm the bad guy. Damn it! The box! Hi, I'm here to pick up... To the study? Know what? That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman? No, no, no, you can't fire him. Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop! Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion! But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that. Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey. Yeah, yeah! And, you know, since, since it doesn't really matter who Zoey's dating now... It's me. You're welcome. Listen, Zoey, I need to ask you something. Did I steal you? So I'm the bad guy. Great. If you say so. Wow. That's a pretty good omelet. No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well. But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids. It's actually a funny story of how we met. I was a best man at this wedding... Okay, well, have a safe trip. It was great seeing you. (Ted phones Marshall) Hello. Marshall. Hey. You will not believe who I just ran into."

1744,6,17,wendy ,"Hey, Ted. Wendy the Waitress. That's 'cause of you? I got to carry an 80-pound bag of bottles to the recycling center every night. I threw my back out. Closed. Sorry. Thanks. Yeah. It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. Except for Marshall Eriksen. Uh, I said it's Marshall Eriksen's fault. Why, do you know him? Me, too. And three kids later, we decided to come here on our second honeymoon. Oh, and hey, what about you? You still with Zoey? Listen, Ted, it's great seeing you, but we got to run."
1745,6,17,woman ,"Oh, Ted, she doesn't want... Actually, I said, ""How's your meat?"" Gee, wonder why."
1746,6,17,zoey ,"Oh, man, this movie is scary. Oh, Ted, did you have a chance to pick up that box I left at my old apartment? You don't have to see him. He left the box with the doorman. Well... yeah. You did. By being the kind of sweet, thoughtful guy who'd never even think of stealing someone, you stole me. Well, the story isn't over, Ted. It'll be years before we know who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. I mean, yes, divorce sucks, but sometimes things need to fall apart to make way for better things. I'm just saying, the eggs are already broken. Let's make sure we get a pretty good omelet out of it."
1747,6,17,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, sometimes wonderful things come out of horrible situations. Like, remember that trip I took to Hong Kong where I got stuck in the airport? Well, a funny thing happened that day. Ted from 2030: What was she doing there? For that, we have to back up about ten years. Ted from 2030: Kids, I had just started dating Zoey. And when you first start dating someone, everyone wants to know the same thing. How did we meet? Ted from 2030: A few days later, I headed over to The Captain's building to get Zoey's box. Captain:You've come to rescue me from the capsized wreckage of my marriage. Mm... I hesitated calling you because I know you and Zoey were friendly. Captain:But my wife has left me. All my friends have abandoned me. Please, tell me you're on my side. Let's adjourn to the study. Captain:Ted, beneath this lustrous mane,I wear the horns of a cuckold. Zoey left me for another man. Captain:Do you have any idea who it could be? Ted from 2030: The Captain then told a story much different than the one I'd been telling. But one maybe just as true. Arthur:...nice presentation. We'll keep it under advisement. Ted from 2030: Oh, Meeker hated him, all right. After all, Marshall was the one who got him fired. Meeker knew we all hung out at MacLaren's. So that night, he went there to confront Marshall. But as luck would have it... Ted from 2030: And the rest, as they say...is history."

Or, we're all adults, I'll just say it... behind Nora. Yeah. pen1s feelings. Because she's hot. Guys, as you know, I only have one rule... If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day [...] Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers [...] Never date a girl with a hook for a hand [...] Never go out with the same girl more than once. There is an exception. And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it. (He sneezes) Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold. About 20 minutes. Can't seem to shake it. Handsome? Rich? Well-endowed? The bed... that's where all the...happens. Ah. Thank you. Good night, Mommy. No. I didn't even see her boobs. She just took care of me. Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist. No. Yes! Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.* Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang * * Bang, bang, bangity bang... * * A bang-bang, bangity-bang. * See, Lily? She was worried. Twen... Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight. Well, now it doesn't. Go on, Doctor. Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner. This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing. What's that like? My friend's dad passed away from a sudden heart attack. So I'm just getting myself checked out, too. Thanks. Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just... No. What is it? That's exactly what I want, too. Hey, guys, this is Nora. I mean, I like being single, but secretly, I want to have kids. Three... one of each. You? Yeah, with ivy growing on it. And we must have a pool. I really am. I assure you, that's not a nickname that I... I'm not lying! Guys, Nora's really special. In fact... I think I'm... falling in love with her. Guys! I'm serious. Guys, this is real. And if you don't make me look good in front of Nora, just remember: I've got dirt on each of you, and I am not afraid to spill it. Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know... your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig? Marshall? The calzone? Robin. The Mr. T dream... Ted? The ballet class. The 'N Sync concert. Okay, Ted. The thermos. I do! So be cool! Thermos. I only have one rule. Never, ever, ever meet a girl's parents. Not even if her mom's hot. I'd love to meet your parents. No, Scooby, you, uh... stay! Yeah, me, too. I'd love to. (He kisses her) There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants. Can you believe... Wait... Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you. I was on the spot. This is your fault. Yeah, with the whole ""I want to get married"" thing. You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship. This... isn't England. Uh, yeah. Isn't that him taking a leak on that fire hydrant? Okay. Lily, I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down. Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. 50 years from now, if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another... 32 years. I mean... Nora's great. She's wonderful. But... Last night? 8:30. I lied. When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry. So am I. This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but I know it's what I want. I want to be confused. With you. Hi. I'm Barney. Great to meet you. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?"
1749,6,18,lily ,"Oh, can she? Can she get a dog, please Dad? Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl. Then why are you going out with Nora again? Wow, she nursed you back to health? Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared? Do you want me to go with you because you're a lot scared? Okay, fine. On one condition. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora. She seems like something special. Ow! Nails, nails! You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora! Yeah, guys, cut it out. Scooby, sit. How did you meet? Did you send her an e-mail, or did you ""collar""? We're just trying to make sure he's not a heel. Oh, I bet it was an ""Incredible Journey"""" This isn't happening. I had no idea he had a deep down. Barney, you promised you wouldn't lie. I'm not going to let you do this. When Nora gets back here, I'm blowing the whistle. Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora. Mr. Buttons? Oh, you son of a bitch. Fine. I'll be nice. Oh, I don't know how we know Barney. How does anyone know how they know anyone? I like your pretty hair, help me. I don't recall. Scooby, we're in our 30s. We don't smoke sandwiches anymore. Guys, I found this on the floor. Scooby got out! Oh, my God! I found Scooby's wallet. Me neither. He must've figured out how to open it himself. Okay. If you were new in town and had just ingested an eighth of sandwich, where would you go? Day's not over. No, that wasn't the lie. The lie was when you told Nora you were lying. Because you weren't. You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do. What time was your dinner reservation? Your heart's talking to you, Barney. Do you have the guts to listen to it."
1750,6,18,marshall ,"Okay, Robin, what you need is indeed something that buries a bone, but I'm not talking about a dog. I'm talking about a man. You're clearly trying to fill a hole... in her heart. You feel like the seventh wheel, because now Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora and Lily's with Big Fudge. Oh, Robin, if you weren't so much stronger than me, I would slap you. I know, and, look, he seems plenty nice, but I didn't mean bring home the first guy you bump into on the street. Oh, I actually think he's quite intelligent for what he is. He's a dog. No, I didn't say, ""He a dawg."" I said, ""He's a dog."" As in, a dog. I think we've all noticed a few curious mannerisms. Or rather, doggerisms. Okay, Scooby, you ready? Okay, you're right. He dropped it. You are so playful. So, Scooby, we were thinking if you're going to be hanging out with our Robin, you should be properly vetted. Tell us the ""tail"" No, no, you're right, Robin. We don't want your new guy to ""flea."" What part of Canada is that? Speak. Just make sure it's not a high-frequency whistle, because we don't want to torture Robin's boyfriend. You got nothing on me. Checkmate. We did not meet him at a strip club. No, sir. Because... Barney don't go to no strip clubs. Okay, I think that we're done here, I think that we have adequately established that Barney is... the kind of guy that you would bring home to meet your parents. Okay? So... let's just drop it, all right? Whoa. Put that away. Sandwiches make me hungry. Yeah? Okay, I'll tell you. Okay. One time Barney saw me drop a calzone on the sidewalk, pick it up, and then keep eating it. It feels so good to finally say that out loud. I... Oh, no! That means the poor guy's out there with no identification. It wasn't me. I know Paul Schaffer's sandwich guy. This could happen. No, great idea! Of course. Back to the pizza place! Who's Scooby? Scooby!"
1751,6,18,nate ,"What's up. guys? Nate Scooberman. But everyone calls me Scooby. I'd love to hang out, but I really gotta hit the john. Thanks, brah. I like you guys. I'm really into gardening, but these squirrels keep messing with my tomatoes. Every time I see them in the backyard, I'm like, ""get out of here!"" And they run off, but sure enough, a few minutes later, there they are again. And I'm like, ""get out of here!"" So annoying. I smell food. Does this place have a kitchen? I'll be right back. Where? Hey, guys, got my shots. Sure was. My part of Canada's pretty different from New York. Labrador. No, I'm good. I'll get 'em. Walk? Somebody say walk? I'll go for a walk. I love a good walk. What do we do now? Oh! I got an idea. I was in the park today, and this guy sold me a big bag of... You guys want to fire these up? Okay. Oh, hey! It's my friends!"
1752,6,18,nora ,"Oh, no. How long have you been sick? Okay, 'cause I was going to say you look a little... Huh, let's say well-endowed... with phlegm. All right, let's go. It's bedtime. Come on, let's get you sorted out. Good night, Barney. This might be a little forward, but do you have a b*mb strapped to your chest? Oh, I'm so sorry. I've been trying not to stare at your chest all night. So is everything okay? Oh, I am so sorry. Um, Barney, what I'm about to say is going to sound a little weird, but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it. I want to get married. I mean, not tonight, or even to you, necessarily. But that's what I want. And if that's going to scare you off, then I'd rather it scare you off now. I want a family, and I want to live in a little house with a garden and a tree for the kids to climb. And I want to go to sleep every night with the same person by my side, and wake up next to him in the morning every morning for the rest of our lives. Just thought you should know that. We were just passing by, and I wanted to pop in for two reasons. First, I wanted to let you know that your friend Barney is being a perfect gentleman. I'm being serious. I had no idea that deep down, he's such a romantic. Oh, you should have heard him at dinner. How many do you want? Three. All in an old stone house. We? A pool sounds brilliant. Are you for real, Barney? I know, right? And the second reason we popped in is 'cause I need to use the loo. But when I get back, I'm dying to hear all about Mr. Softy here. There's a man back there who seems fascinated by the records flipping in the jukebox. So. How do you all know Barney? Oh, come on. Barney's been to a strip club once. Really? So Barney really is a genuinely a nice guy. It's funny you should say that, because, as it happens, my parents are in town. They're only here like once a year. We're getting brunch tomorrow. Do you want to meet them? It's a date. Well, we should get going. Walk me home? Here we are. I had a really great time tonight. Do you want to come upstairs? Misled? You lied to me! You had your friends lie to me! My fault? Good-bye, Barney. Barney. I'm confused. Mom, Dad... this is Barney."
1753,6,18,robin ," Actually, I'm thinking about getting a dog again.  You wouldn't have to take care of it.  Yeah, that was made out of silk, Ted.  Here we go.  I don't know. This will be your second date.  Oh, hey, guys. This is Nate. Nate, these are my friends.  What? You told me to meet someone.  Actually, I met him in the park.  Okay, but you have to admit that he is a lot of fun.  And what is he?  What? You saw him hitting on someone?  That last one did not happen.  He's not a dog.  Guys, just stop hounding him. Oh, geez.  Hey, Nate, why don't you go play some music on the jukebox.  Oh, shoot, dropped my keys.  Well, it's still early. Unbelievable.  Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream... I'm lost.  Sorry, toots. He's taken.  Oh, no. I got called back in to work. Can you keep an eye on him until I get back? He's new to the city, and he doesn't really know anyone.  He's not a... Good night.  ""Got out""? What do you mean?  Guys. Get yourselves together and start looking for Scooby. I'm on my way home.  Hey, have you seen Scooby?"
1754,6,18,ted ,"Barney, come on, this is important. We need you around for a long time. Without you, we'd have to find some other sex-fueled, depraved animal to entertain us. No. If you get a dog, I'm going to be the one stuck taking care of it. Really? And who watered the philodendron on your bookcase and sang it back to life? Uh, yeah, it's right in here... Scooby. Should have just let you get a dog. He's totally a dog. Uh, Scooby, the tag's still on your jeans. Good boy! Robin, it's fine. You said you wanted a dog and you got one. And the best part is, he got his shots. Nice job fetching those. Uh, yeah. We hope our nosiness doesn't give you ""paws."" So, moving from Canada, that transition must have been pretty ""ruff."" Go ahead. Give me your best. My life's an open book. I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed. 1998. Cleveland's Gund Arena, front row. Caught JC's shirt. What else you got? I suppose it's possible Barney has real feelings for Nora. Once? Nope. Not even once. Not even if she's hot? I knew it. I knew it. I knew if you got a dog, I'd wind up taking care of it. Sandwich brownies? Truth. Hey. I have a question. What did Barney mean when he said ""calzone""? Dude. Listen to me. You have nothing to be ashamed of. That calzone sounds amazing. Oh, my God. Scooby ate the whole tray. Wait. Where is he, anyway? He just walked out of the apartment. Someone must've left the door open. He's so smart. We should get him on Letterman doing tricks. Wait wait! Robin. Can you pick up some calzones? Great idea. Yeah! Maybe that's where Scooby went."
1755,6,18,the cardiologist," Are we done?  Well, Barney, your heart sounds fine.  Although it seems like you might have a slight arrhythmia.  It's probably nothing to worry about, but I'd like you to wear this heart monitor for the next 24 hours.  Don't worry. It's totally safe. Unless part of your big date involves connecting yourself to a car battery.  Okay, everything looks fine here, although I did notice a few irregularities. There's nothing to be...alarmed about.  What happened at 8:46 p.m. last night?  And that explains your 14-second cardiac arrest.  And that explains 12:51 a.m. Okay. None of this suggests a systemic issue. Your heart's fine. With a healthy diet, you can live a long and happy life. If nobody stabs you.  What did his heart do at 8:30? It... literally skipped a beat."
1756,6,18,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, the heart is a mysterious muscle. You never really know what's going on in there. So after Uncle Marshall lost his father, he decided to get his heart checked. And so did I... and so did Lily... and so did Robin. And then Marshall went again, just to be sure. There was only one holdout. Ted from 2030: Barney said this a lot. Ted from 2030: And it was always the same exception. Barney:...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot. Ted from 2030: That night, Barney didn't take care of business. Instead, Nora took care of Barney. Ted from 2030: And exactly 24 hours later, they returned for the results. Ted:Yes, how did you ""whisker"" off her feet? Shed a little light on the matter. Ted from 2030: This was a big deal for Barney. Ted from 2030: Kids, it was a big bag of sandwiches. Ted, on the phone with Robin:Robin! Hey. Hey, um, remember Scooby? Uh, well, he got out."

And that basketball hoop? Outdoor stripper pole. We'll just tell the ladies to be careful in the winter. You think a tongue stuck to a frozen pole is bad... Oh, thank God. I'll go first. Ted, this hous you bought for your hypothetical family is super weird. We talk about it all the time behind your back. Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks. Yeah... here's the thing about me and tools... the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again. Well, here's our screwdriver now. (Barney opens the door, then whispers loudly:) Guys, I'm pretty sure that's not Luis, but I can't be certain. Someone introduce yourself. Dad? Where do I begin? Yeah. I think I need a drink. Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is... this is going to take me a minute. I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now. Make a muscle. Ah! Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out. Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that? So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him. Do you... get laid a lot? Oh, my God, that took you five seconds. You're a master. You are legen... wait for it... Oh, that's cool. This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg. (both laughing) What do you mean? First of all, Robin, my dad could beat up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me... I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready. I'm not sure how to start this. I think I need a drink. Glen McKenna, neat. Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night? Wow. Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that? Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass. Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff. Yes, yes, yes. *Out of control.* You ever bang Stevie Nicks? Big-time. Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the ""Father Knows Breast,"" there's the ""Bush Dynasty,"" the ""Lick Father, Lick Son."" Why? You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this. What? No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that. Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again. Fine, I'll go. Oh, thank you very much. And I love your...coat. I love your coat. Well, I do love it. It's doing a nice job covering up that chair. It ages well, that's the thing. I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas. J.J., I'm talking to Dad right now. God. Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.? Oh, well, huh, now we all know you make excuses. I was talking about money. Good time to get into print media. Am I right, Dad? Uh, you don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj. Dad, check it. Triceps. What gym do you go to? Sounds like you're having your fourth period. Am I right, Dad?! Why? J.J. started it. What does J.J. even stand for anyway? J... Jerky... Jerkface? Jerome Jr...? Oh. He's... he's named after you. Excuse me. This is mine. J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me. Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad. Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?! Oh, ""screwed up"" doesn't even begin to describe... Can you help me with this? Bye. I'm fine. Hey, Ted. You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there? No, you were right. A kid needs a hoop."

Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for The Stones through West Germany, and their tour manager loses his arms, bus-surfing through a tunnel. Gnarly. Long story short, I've been managing tours ever since, and that dude high-fives people with his face now. Big-time. Observe. Oh, was it that long? Life's too short for chatty chicks. So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow with Bon Jovi. I'll be on the road the rest of the year. Say, you want to join me for the tour's Asian leg? Hey, uh, you're Barney's friends, right? What? No, I... I'm a driving instructor up in White Plains. And I need your help... Barney won't return my calls. That's not what happened. Yeah. Me, too. Milk, skim. I'll say. Between you and me, I had a lot of acid last night. I think it was the chili dog. I had to take four Tums. I was up till, like, 9:30. No. I switched lanes years ago. I should explain. I'm a driving instructor. Now you get it, right Oh, I know. I was a real hard partier. The drugs, the alcohol, the women... I was out of control. So when your mom said I couldn't see you any more, it was rock bottom for me. I'm so sorry. Barney wasn't interested in my apology. He just wanted me to be cool. And I was so desperate to connect with him. I did something I'm not proud of. I started bragging. I bet you didn't know this about me, Barney, but I've published two nonfiction books about asparagus. And one fiction. I'm credited with inventing the word ""furgling."" It means fumbling for keys. So then all the county fair judges started chanting, ""More quiche! More quiche!"" I guess you could call me the LeBron James of drapes. I could tell he just wanted me to be this big ladies' man, so... What a hottie, huh? I'm sure you're a real player. Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate. Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that. I have a family now. That's my wife Cheryl, my daughter Carly... she's in college. This is my son J.J. I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them. I made him wait all these years for me and... I'm just not the guy he wanted me to be. I know I don't deserve it, but... I need another chance to connect with my son. J.J., dinner. When I got your letter, I dug this up. You were probably too young to remember, but this is you, this is me, and, of course, ZZ Top. Yeah, I used to love taking you backstage. You were the coolest little kid. Good slam, Barney. It's all good fun. Just ribbing among long lost brothers. Got him again. Oh, okay, Barney. Uh, maybe that's enough. J.J. stands for Jerome Jr. Barney, what is going on? I don't understand. Please, just come down and talk to me. Why does that make you so mad? Look, Barney, I know I screwed up... I know, I know, I know! I want to fix this, and I don't know how! Please, tell me what I can do! I'll do anything! You're never gonna get it down like that. Barney. Barney! Just put the pointy end into the grooves. That's it. Now turn it. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. I have no good excuse, Barney. It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down. It took courage to send me that letter. More courage than I've ever had. I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I... I just have no idea where to begin. Here, got it. Look, if you... ever feel like you're ready, I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life."
1761,6,19,jj ,"Hi, Barney. It's great to finally meet you. I'm 11. I got a paper route. Fourth period? I like having a brother."
1762,6,19,lily ," We have a confession. This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house. It's an intervention.  You call the super for a screwdriver?  ""So, how 'bout those last 30 Super Bowls""?  Why did you abandon me?  Barney, we... we know you're psyched, but just... be careful.  Yeah. That would make Jerry a real chamma-leeon.  You got nothing on me.  Sure, honey. (She throws the key toward the wall besides Marshall)  That's not true.  What do you mean, Barney won't return your calls? He said you two had an amazing night together.  We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.  Guess now we wait.  What, baby?  Robin, don't disagree with Marshall.  I love him.  But, baby, you just lost your dad. None of us wants to upset you.  You can't swallow pills.  You're too old to ask to see the cockpit.  Aw, honey.  Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?"
1763,6,19,marshall ,"Hey. Barney, let's go outside for a second. Barney, I can't believe your giant TV is broken. It's March Madness. I can't believe Barney is talking to his dad right now. Why'd you wait so long to contact me? Hey, Lily, can you toss me a beer? Lily, at our apartment, you're the one who pees on the floor. Yeah, but... aren't you supposed to be off managing some tour in Australia? You're having dinner with him tonight. No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road. Awesome. Um, Lily, keys. (She throws them way too hard, they land in the trees) I'm literally 11 inches from you. Hey, I got an idea how to pass the time. A little trivia game. Robin, reindeer: real or fake? Yikes! I'm surrounded by a bunch of dum-dums. Good thing I don't have any gaps in my knowledge. I am perfect. Oh, for the love of God, guys, enough already. You've been treating me with kid gloves ever since my dad died. I first noticed it at the bar. Hey, Lily, (his voice cracks) Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys. [...] The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie. You guys like my new soul patch? And once I figured it out, I started doing crazy stuff to see how far you'd let me go. [...]Hey, guys. This is Rex. He's a possum. I found him in the trash. He lives with us now. Lily, we are living with a possum. Rex is violent and he hates us. Please. If you guys really want me to get over the worst tragedy of my life, I'm begging you, tear me a new one. But not like Rex tried to in my sleep last night. Seriously, it's time. What are my gaps? Don't you think that maybe we should go home and, uh, ""do the laundry"" Yes, I drown the son of a bitch. It's like I'm blind. Whoa. Whoa. Guys, my dad just died. No, I'm just kidding. This is great. I really, I really missed this."
1764,6,19,robin ,"Yeah, what do you say after three decades of not seeing each other? Well, to be fair, everyone has some glaring gap in knowledge, something really obvious you somehow never learned. Really? I seem to recall... Ted, that wasn't easy. It took a lot of ""ch-aracter"" to admit that. You want to tussle? Let's tussle. Please, no. Seriously? The North Pole? Okay, pal, if you want to break up with me, just tell it to me straight. Don't pretend you're going someplace we all know doesn't exist. Of who? Santa's elves? Rudolph? You know what? I'm going on a trip, too, Scott. It, uh, starts in Narnia. It works its way up to Candyland, and then, hey, congratulate me, because I'm the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Expelliarmus! So... you want to get pizza later? Or... I still think about him in the shower. You've hurt me before, why should I trust you now? Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt. Oh, my God. Barney's dad. Are you sure it's not more than that? Okay, I'm not an idiot. Reindeer are obviously f... re... fake? That's not true. I'm sorry. Righteous hair tab, brotha. Ooh, ooh, I got one. You think John Kennedy and Jack Kennedy are the same person. (laughs) Right? What? You consistently miss at least one belt loop."
1765,6,19,scott ,"So this really sucks, but I'm going to be in the North Pole for the next three months. Um, I'm going to be studying the mating habits of... Robin, the North Pole is a real place. You know that, right? I think we should break up."

Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids. Yeah. This intervention isn't for me. It's for you Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver? Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools. Okay, now I feel bad about making fun of him for the tool thing. My dad was the one who taught me all that stuff. Okay, but a screwdriver? Come on, I don't have any gaps that fundamental. Daniel Burnham was an architect whose ever-shifting style and aesthetic made him a true architectural chamma-leeon. And only the most gifted chamma-leeon could've designed classic beaux arts masterpieces right alongside sleek modern flatirons. His name might as well have been Daniel Chamma-leeon. Betty, I'm pretty sure it's pronounced ""chamma-leeon,"" so... Class dismissed. No homework. For a while. Okay, I learned that word by reading it. That's how I've always pronounced it. Okay, Scherbatsky. You want to tussle? I'll tussle. Marine biologist. Hey. Tell us everything. How'd it go, bud? Well, this guy has flaked out on your whole life. It sounds like he just might be telling you what you want to hear. I hope Barney's dad isn't just pretending to be something he's not, you know? You have gaps, too, Lily. You have terrible aim. Well, I guess maybe one gap you have is... you can't wink. You always add too much water to oatmeal. Yeah, buddy. Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine."
1768,6,19,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, I bought the house we live in now way back before I ever met your mother. It needed a lot of work, but I had a vision for it. Ted from 2030: Why did Barney need an intervention? It all started a few nights earlier. Jerry (Barney's dad): So, I'm not sure how to start this. Barney, laughing: You're funny. My dad's funny. Barney:...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream. Ted from 2030: And so Barney agreed to give his dad one more chance."
1769,6,20,barney ,"Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner. Quit GNB?! Why? Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes. Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning. (Barney snickers) Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids. Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira. Where? I want his autograph! Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having s*x with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it. No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees! It starts with an... ""L?"" And I said my name was...? It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall-... ruined everything. I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today. What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws. There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games? Just come back to GNB already! That's how I'm gonna use mine. Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better. Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. ""Barney, we have to talk about your father."" ""Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil."" ""Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session ""between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute."" I don't need this! Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today? Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time. How long have you been there? Oh, no, I'm fine. There's nothing to talk about. I don't want to talk about it, okay? Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything. That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true? Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub. It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day. Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life. I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then... Eat this meatball sub. I don't have much time!"

1772,6,20,lily ,"Isn't it hard for you guys to be on opposite sides of something like this? You guys are in screaming matches all the time. Your relationship sounds exhausting. Marshall and I have been together 15 years, and the only debate we've had about Tommy Boy is whether it's awesome or super awesome. That's love, bitch. Baby, you have my full support. The guy who was basically a dog? Baby, more than ever, you have my full support. (Lily and Marshall kisses) I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey. Oh, good for you, sweetie. Baby, if this is what you need to do, we'll figure it out. How's Barney handling you leaving? Why don't you admit that your girlfriend challenging your every move is getting you a little murder-suicidey? It's not. Okay, Ted, the downside to having a woman's mouth is, your feminine pout gives away your true feelings. And yours is saying, ""Oh, Zoey, why can't I be on top just this once?"" Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker. Oh, and I'm loving seeing you this happy. Baby, you have my full support. Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right? (Ted says something in spanish) Perfect. Let's go. You're right. I-If you and Zoey are happy, then who am I to judge? I'm so sorry. But I thought you liked being challenged. Well, in her defense, hamburger pizza, Ted? What are you, 12? Yeah, I-I know. So you can drive him to the fund-raiser. Supporting Marshall this much is driving me crazy. I'm going to Spain-- my flight leaves in 45 minutes. Adios, muchacho. You were right. If I hear myself say ""Baby, you have my full support"" one more time, I swear I'm gonna m*rder someone! I honestly haven't thought it all the way through, and I don't intend to. All I know is that I'm a ticking time b*mb, and if I don't do something for me right away, I swear I'm gonna explode! Marshall's been asking a lot lately. I've never been good at that. And now, ever since his dad died, I-I feel like it's my job to just be fine with everything. But I'm not. I'm not fine that he volunteers our apartment for a giant fund-raiser and that he's not thinking about how we're gonna pay any of our bills and that, apparently, we've given up on trying to have kids. Look, I'm sorry, Ted, I just, I gotta do this. (Lily leaves) Marshall, hey. Sorry, I, uh, I had to park and-and grab some ice. Sorry. Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I-I need to talk to you about something. Baby, you have my full support. You're too young. This isn't fair."
1773,6,20,lily and marshall,... don't see eye-to-eye on anything! Totally.
1774,6,20,man ,"Guys, everything's ruined. Your girlfriend somehow got the Landmark Preservation Committee to agree to a hearing. If they declare the Arcadian a landmark, the whole project is dead. The good news is, I just got the phone number of a husky-voiced hottie in a turtleneck. I'm sorry. I don't speak... whatever it is you're speaking. My bag? Oh, no. I got it."
1775,6,20,marshall ,"I have to quit. I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species... What? You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB. Baby, I did it! I quit. And then I walked right over to the NRDC, and I took that job. Yeah. It's a little less money than I was expecting. I mean, compared to what I was making at GNB, it's nothing. Actually compared to anything, it's nothing. It's nothing. The paid position just got filled, so all I can do is-is volunteer right now. You're cool with that, right? Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC. Barney, I'm not playing... I'm really loving my new job. I'm so glad to hear you say that because I volunteered our apartment for a big NRDC fund-raiser tomorrow night. You're-You're cool with that, right? Thanks, baby. (phone chirps) Oh. Ooh, I gotta go. The invitations are ready. The party's for a bunch of environmentalists, so I found a guy downtown who makes biodegradable party invitations that can also be used as toilet paper. Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't. Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there. Hey, Professor Rodriguez, thank you so much for coming. Right over there. Enjoy. Hey. Hey, thanks for picking him up. What? Oh, thanks, babe. You would not believe how much this one has done to help throw this party, Ted. I don't know how she does it. Can't be easy, huh, Lil? No, you know what? Me, too. Um... I want to thank you for being so supportive of me in all this. I've been at the NRDC for less than a week, and I've already done more to be proud of than in two years at GNB. I can't believe how good it feels. But now, it's time for me to find a way to help the Earth and get paid for it, because I can't put that burden entirely on you. So, starting tomorrow, I'll look for something with a paycheck. What do you think? We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end. Yes, of course, of course... anything. Wh-Where'd you get a meatball... Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?"
1776,6,20,robin ,"Or maybe he was. Think about it. The way that she bats her eyelashes and shakes her tail feathers in his face? (chuckles) She wants it. For the love of God, will one of you idiots hang up the phone? It's graduation goggles. Hershel? Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?  Oh, my God! You don't remember? Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day. Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch? Yeah. You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad. Why not? I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... (quietly): ticking. No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts. Huh? What is wrong with you?"
1777,6,20,ted ,"Of course you feel that way, Lily. You and Marshall have basically melded into one big hermaphroditic blob. And that's fine for you guys. But some of us want a partner who challenges us to grow and evolve. Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Growing matches. The main character is a young spoiled prince thrust into leadership after the death of his father. It's obviously a modern-day retelling of Henry IV! Okay, clearly, when we're watching Tommy Boy, we're watching two different movies. No, you hang up. No, you hang up. No, you hang up! (Later) No, you hang up. No, you... (His phone starts beeping) Hold on. (beep) Hello? Why would you do that?! Who likes that? Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy. It's dinero. You know, sometimes I feel bad for Lily and Marshall. It's like they never challenge each other. They just automatically agree all the time. Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play ""Who's Hot and Who's Scott?"" Oh, come on. Everything's not ruined. What? Why? I'm furiously enjoying being challenged. Why don't you admit that Marshall quitting his job and taking an unpaid internship is k*ll*ing you? Lily, the downside to having giant, Japanese anime eyes is that they're easy to read. And yours are screaming, ""What about my trip to Spain, deadbeat?"" We take turns! Sometimes. Ah, Lily Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple! I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks. One: your mom didn't seem to mind it last night on her... You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Marshall doesn't make us a worse couple. Oh, my God, is that how support feels? It's so warm and wonderful. Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy. Nobody likes being challenged! Couldn't she agree with me just once, even on something little, like... like what movie to see or-or what topping to get on our pizza or... oh, I don't know, my lifelong dream of building a skyscraper in New York City?! You were right, Lily. I mean, Zoey's great, but... sometimes I do wish we were a little more like you and Marshall. There he is. Here we go. (Ted says some incomprehensible things in spanish) Um, he speaks perfect English. Then why did you ask me to come? W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain? What are you gonna tell Marshall, huh? And when are you coming back? Wow, tha... that's an evocative metaphor to use for your nonthreatening, totally patriotic emotions. U.S.A.! Okay, Lily, I get it. But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough. Lil... Yeah, absolutely. Um, listen, something happened at the airport. Um... Well, we got there, and, uh, Lily...(sighs) Lily... Hey! What are you doing here? This you can be supportive of?! I have the chance to build a skyscraper in the best city on Earth, and who's the one leading the charge to k*ll that dream? My girlfriend! Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas."
1778,6,20,zoey ," Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on! Hey, sweetie! Are we still on for dinner at 8:00 at Valenzisi's? That's great! I can't wait! No, you hang up. No, you hang up. No, you hang up. Well, they don't do that all the time. No, they don't. Ted. This is really important to Marshall, so I came to show my support. What is that supposed to mean? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about my lifelong dream of not seeing every beautiful building in Manhattan bulldozed?"
1779,6,20,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, as you know, I was designing Goliath National Bank's new headquarters on the site of this old hotel, The Arcadian. Problem was, some people didn't want The Arcadian torn down. Even bigger problem, they were led by my girlfriend Zoey. Ted from 2030: But somehow, Zoey and I were making it work. Ted from 2030: It was true. Zoey and I loved to challenge each other. Zoey:Are you kidding me?! It's Don Quixote...the classic quest story with the hero-jester and his long-suffering manservant! Zoey:I-I thought you'd like it. Zoey:I like it. Ted from 2030: Now around this time, Marshall had truly come to hate his job. He hated the paperwork. He hated the coffee. He hated the dirty jokes. He hated everything. Robin:I don't think you know what Spain is. Ted from 2030: So Marshall walked in the next morning all ready to quit. But then something weird happened. Suddenly, he didn't hate the paperwork. He didn't hate the coffee. He didn't even hate the dirty jokes. Out of nowhere, Marshall actually liked GNB. Robin:Graduation goggles, like with high school. It's four years of bullies making fun of all the kids with braces, even after the braces come off and they can walk just fine. But then, on graduation day, you suddenly get all misty because you realize you're never going to see those jerks again. I just had graduation goggles with that guy Scooby I dated. Robin:He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful. (as speaking to a dog): He was a good boy. Robin:The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer. Ted:Yes, they do. Ted:Yes, they do. It's like they... Robin:...so, if the Landmarks Preservation Committee sides with Zoey, your whole project goes down the tubes? You must be furious. Robin:Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall? Barney:Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us? Barney:Right. So, um... Chinese? Barney:...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted. (quiet sobbing) You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right? Prof. Rodriguez: Oh, my pleasure. I have to use the restroom. Do you have some extra invitations? Ted from 2030: And in that moment, I realized, though I really cared about Zoey, I couldn't do this for the next 50 years. I had to break up with her. But then... Kids, some couples always support each other, and some couples always challenge each other, but is one really better than the other? Yes. Support is better. Way better. But I'd have to learn that the hard way. Barney, weakly: Thank you, Marshall. (coughs weakly) Marshall... can I ask one final favor, my friend? Barney, with a mean laugh: I'm not sick, you idiots! I've racked up $30,000 of uninsured medical bills for symptoms I don't even have. Totally worth it! You should see the look on your face. Oh, wait, you can't-- 'cause it's covered in marinara sauce!"

Turns out I would never do that in a million years. You do not know how right you are. Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything. I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues. Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight. I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh... (chuckles) no, thanks. And... hence new identities. Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer. Lily, his wife. Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band. Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong... Oh, no. No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right? Guys, focus. No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed. No, Shut up shut down. I can't believe I don't know the clubs anymore. It's hopeless, isn't it? I know. Daddy's home. And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard! Man, isn't this place great? Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk about your open marriage. Let's do shots. No. Don't you remember what you said to me when I was a kid? ""Never stop partying."" You don't remember the last thing you said to me when I was a kid? Well... you know, why don't you just go back home? Yeah, well, I want to hang out with Crazy Jerry, not Stay-at-Home Jerome. Can you believe it? This is awesome! I finally know what it's like to be embarrassed by my dad. Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y... you really want to be out here like this? No, of course not. I... I just... Yeah! Let's do it! Uh, maybe fix the tie. But mostly, party! : Hey, hey! There we go! Oh...! It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So... next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special... What? But all those crazy things you did. A drunk audience. No, no, no. You don't even know! Right here! Oh...! What just happened? Well, why do all those things? You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy...! Hey, you know, a... a pretty good magician like you probably knows how to, say, get out of a standard set of handcuffs. Well, here's something you didn't know... I'm a pretty good magician, too. (They escape and run away) Abracadabra! We need someplace to hide. No, Jerry, this is not the time to go to another club! We've got to get you back home in time for that trip. But there's no more trains, there's no cabs. Step on it! Jerry... Jerry, we have got to get you home in time for that fishing trip. This is no time for laws! I am not going to buckle up! How did you do it? How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but... I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs... Hey, I'm trying to open up to you... When I think about going for anything more than that, I look at my life, and who I am, and... I'm too far gone. I'm broken. This... sucks."
1782,6,21,jerry ,"Barney, afraid this is good-bye. Your buzz k*ll of a ma... thinks I'm a... a bad influence on you. But she's your mother and I'm... you know, I'm just your Uncle Jerry. So, this is the last time I can see you. Sorry, buddy, but this is it. But don't you forget your training. What's a magician's best friend? I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life. Hi, Barney. It's your dad. Look, would you like to go fishing with me and J.J. on Sunday morning? Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... ""Crazy Jerry""? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right? That's... a little depressing. So, Saturday night... time to cut loose, right? Who wants to split a beer? Where's Where? Okay. I don't know. Third base! Right? I'll go anyplace, okay? I might be allergic to this stamp. Uh, I don't know. It's so loud! My goodness! Uh, no, thank you, Barney. I have that fishing trip with J.J. early tomorrow. I... I better take it easy. But I want to hang out with you. Fine. You want Crazy Jerry? (He drinks four shots) There! You got him! I apologize... it might take a few minutes to kick in. Hey, sugar! Five beers for the table, a Seven-and-Seven for me, and your ten digits for this guy here! Tonight Crazy Jerry's gonna burn this disco down! Whoo! Wa-hah! Oh, sorry, small-town preacher from the Midwest, is there a law against dancing? Oh, this club blows. Let's hit the greatest party in the world, the streets of New York! Hey... Bottoms up, amigo! Oh, look what I just ripped out of the ground! I just puked on the hood of that... police car! (Laughing) Too bad your playwright friend isn't a lawyer. Barney, I'm so sorry. I'm afraid this is what it's like hanging out with Crazy Jerry. Oh, for corn's sake, Barney, I'm not drunk! I told you, I don't party anymore, and you wouldn't take no for an answer. So... I used a little... sleight-of-hand... to make you think otherwise. Here you go. Bottoms up, amigo! Do you happen to remember what a magician's best friend is? Look. Look what I just ripped out of the ground! I... I just puked on the hood of that... (siren blares)...police car. I figured if I showed you what... ""never stop partying"" really looked like, you'd realize you can't do it forever. (sighs heavily) Oh, well. I wanted to hang out with you... you're my son. And since you didn't want to come with me and J.J. On that fishing tri... Fishing trip. I'll never make it back in time now. Perhaps. Where? Well, uh... I do have a few driving students in the city. Do not step on it. The laws are there to protect... Buckle up, Barney. I am your father! You will listen to me! Do what? You're drifting. No, Mrs. Perkins, you're drifting! Go on, Barney. Son, I was far more broken than you'll ever be. And look at me now. Don't get me wrong... settling down is... a challenge. It's the biggest challenge of your life. A magician never reveals his greatest trick. But I'll give you a hint. You gotta meet the right girl. Who knows? Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow. And park. And emergency brake. I did have a good time tonight. And hey, if you want to go fishing, we got room in the boat. Okay. Oh, and, uh... thanks for taking such good care of this. It means a lot to me that you kept it safe all these years."
1783,6,21,lily ,"That's why you brought these guys. Whoo-hoo! Hey, Barney... love the new identities. Little thing... instead of being a naked super ninja, can I be Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada? Well, most nights. Mama don't let no ring get in the way of a good time. Where's where Was was, isn't it? I thought Focus was closed. Guys, shut up. Mila Kunis?! Okay. Well, after a long day of style meetings and photo shoots and being way too mean to my assistant, I sometimes bang an underwear model. Oh, uh, only 'cause you have nothing to do all day. I work 90 hours a week subsidizing your ""real job."" I brought French cooking to America! Hey, you do better than me at a lot of other things, like digesting dairy... and reaching for stuff. So our usual wager. Deal. I won that race. My prize... s*x in the bathroom. Aw, sorry that secret crush didn't work out for you. Why are you smiling?"
1784,6,21,man ,Hi. I could use a woman's opinion. Is this working for me? I was trying on the pants. Hi. A few years ago at a department store... did you embarrass the hell out of me? I should be so lucky. Right. Um... it was really nice to see you again. Yeah. And her fiancé? The guy's like a two.
1785,6,21,marhsall ,"Okay, you know what? Game on. If I can score five numbers before you can, then we have s*x in the bathroom. But... if you can score five numbers before me, then we have s*x in the bathroom."
1786,6,21,marshall ,"Mmm. Your dad? Improvements?! Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards. Gross! Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet. Um, those places shut down a long time ago. Oh, No shut down, too. That's wrong. That's not Wrong. So Closed is open. Guys, just pick a club, okay? For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Lamé. Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters. And so bourgeois. Many of plays are about the bourgeois. And ennui. And one rock opera about... a frozen yogurt shop. I sleep around, too. Just as much. A little more, even. Are we having this fight again? Writing plays is a real job! I won a Tony! What? So you really believe that if we were in an open marriage that you would do better than me? Hello. Hi, Robin. Could I have your phone number? And I won that race."
1787,6,21,robin ,"Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs. Aw, man! Why? Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again. Two, three, four! Okay is Lame? I thought Lame was a gay bar. Or is that Wrong? Oh, I like Focus. Let's go there. Not Where. Focus. No, Closed is closed. Ew, Third Base is all frat guys. Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar. Oh, my God, my secret crush is here. No, my secret crush. We met a few years ago. Uh... no. (laughs) The only good thing about how ugly that shirt is, is that it distracts from how terribly it fits you. Oh. (Laughs) I had to leave before we could finish talking, so that was it. You know, ever since then, I've always... Oh, my God, he's coming over here. Oh. Hello. Oh, I'm sorry, you must have me confused with the shirt you were wearing that day. Mm-hmm. You, too. Barney, how is that awesome? Okay, Jerry's gone; Let's break up. Well, that guy who came over here who thinks we're dating, I kind of have a crush on him. Can you help me clear it up? A four? God, you are, like, the worst judge of guys ever. Okay, if he is a four, what are you? You're a doofus and a half. At a close-out sale at Dawes. Oh, Ted. Oh, no. Just take off your damn shirt. Okay. All right. Whoa, stop. Stop. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah, just like that. Well, somebody had to. Yes. Oh, hey! Thank you so much. We're super excited. We're thinking June. (laughs) Yeah, okay. Okay, jerk, do you remember how you ended up buying those red cowboy boots? So get off the field at the Superdome, because you ain't no saint. I, uh... Oh. Oh, it's okay. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. I don't know. Good night."
1788,6,21,ted ,"You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year. Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, ""Man is least himself when he talks..."" Ah. You're right... ""No quoting Oscar Wilde."" How good was that movie? Uh, hi again. Ted. Oh, and, Jerry, you remember my girlfriend. There's Where? Not Okay. That place is lame. Where? Not Okay. Okay is lame. Not Okay! Hi! I'm Ted! Robin's boyfriend! Nice to meet you. Okay. ""I would have stolen you a whole orchestra."" There. What's the rush? Really? That guy? He was, like, a four. Hey! I'm not perfect; I'm an eight... and a half. Fine. Let's go talk to him. Where'd you meet this booger-eater anyway? Really? I remember that sale. Hey, Robin. Look what I just bought. Right? Right? (He is wearing the Red Boots) Hold on. We were dating then. I specifically remember, because we had great s*x that night. Great s*x. Let me guess. Someone wants to knock... boots. Boots. (imitating g*nshots) All right. What? But I... I can't see, and you can't see me. You were picturing your crush! Okay, okay, answer me this. Are you absolutely sure it had nothing whatsoever... to do with the boots? Do you have these in a size 11? Hey! How's the open marriage going? Who was the first one to get the five numbers?"
1789,6,21,woman ,Congratulations! You would look so totally hot in those.
1790,6,21,,"Jerry, laughing: Attaboy. You still got that button from the festival we went to? Now... I'm gonna put this right inside your brain, behind your ear... so that I'll know that you won't forget me. See you, buddy. And hey... Never... stop... partying. Ted from 2030: Kids, in 1983, Barney watched his father walk out of his life. And in 2011, when their first reunion ended badly... Ted from 2030: This time it was Barney who did the walking. Ted from 2030: And that was almost the end of it. Except, a few weeks later... Barney:Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney? Barney:No. That's why I brought these guys. (He gets several cards out of his inside pocket) I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards. Barney:Yeah. Barney:Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage. Barney:Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself. (chuckles) Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about. Barney:Ted, card. Barney:Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted. Ted from 2030: And so Barney's dad finally showed up. Ted, whispering to Robin: You owe me one. Jerry, looking horrified: I said that? To a six-year-old? I don't remember that. Ted, loudly: You hear that, everybody? She said ""yes""! We're getting married! (Ted chuckles) I love this girl. I'm never letting her go. Ted from 2030: After that, Barney's memory of the night got a little hazy. Jerry, to a big tattoed biker: You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy! You don't even know! Barney, laughing: Whoa! Jerry, to a dummy wearing a biker outfit: You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy! Ted, chuckling: Wow. Wardrobe malfunction at the O.K. Corral! I mean, who in their right mind would ever... Man, on the phone: Saw that girl again. And guess what? She's engaged. So that's the end of that. Ted from 2030: It wasn't the end of that. More on that later Barney:So how do you do it? Barney:Maybe I've met her already. Barney:Maybe some other time. Barney:I'm going fishing with my dad."
1791,6,22,all ,"Hey! Ten, nine, eight... Happy New Year! Good order, Ted! Good order!"
1792,6,22,arthur ,"Good luck, Marshall. And promise you'll list me as a reference. Oh, yeah, I worked with Marshall Eriksen... at least I did when he actually showed up. Marshall! Hey, it's, uh, it's 2:30. If it's no big deal, we'd sure love it if you'd try to get here at least before lunch. Oh, yeah. We fired him when we caught him clubbing a seal in his office with an even cuter seal. The guy's a maniac. He's just an awful, flatulent racist."
1793,6,22,assistant ,"Oh! Mr. Eriksen... You're not wearing any pants. But Marshall, wh... What about the environment?"
1794,6,22,barney ,"Invitations for the demolition of The Arcadian. As head of the project, I get to decide how we knock it down. I'm torn between training an actual coyote to use an ACME dynamite plunger, or hooking up a fuse to Eddie Van Halen's guitar that goes off the second he hits the last note to ""Hot For Teacher."" Barney! Barney! Bar... No, no. I'm going to go coyote. Oh, come on. Zoey's not shutting anything down, standing out there with her stupid megaphone, screaming in the wind; butt cheeks trembling with fury; her perky breasts heaving; her self-righteous nipples... Point is, we are taking her and The Arcadian down. Am I right, Teddy Westside? Glad to know she's also mouthy in a good way. What up? Dude, that's his girlfriend. Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day? I mean this is really like... No. I' was... I was... Pfff. Try 283. 250 was months ago. No, no, no. No, I mean, you're totally 250, baby. No, don't. (The girl leaves) Are you sure it doesn't taste like anything else? Kent! Kent! That's what you get, you traitor! Yeah. Really. I'm a B-plus. My whole life, I was hoping to be an A, and I'm a B-plus. And I'm okay with that. Hey there, darlin'. How you doin'? Ah, is this your sister? Mmm... Beautiful. Mmm... Show me chicken wings! Do you know what I had to do to get you that job? What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like? Oh, my God. Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that... It made me wonder, ""What could I have done to make him stay?"" That's what everyone keeps saying but people just keep leaving me. Your place or mi... Your place or mi... Le-Let's go to your place. Mm. I love you. Uh, no. N-Not right... You have some coffee? So I can throw it in this traitor's face? I love you. Uh, no. N-not right... What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone? Whoa, whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Ted..."
1795,6,22,carl ,"Okay, enough! You guys are out of here. I meant all of you. You're all banned from the bar. Out! Come on in, you're un-banned. I gave these guys some drinks and they calmed down and made up."
1796,6,22,delivery guy, Delivery from Mr. Stinson.
1797,6,22,lily ,"Okay. See, that's so weird to me. One second you're defending Zoey, and the next, you're talking about her going down. Isn't it tough dating the woman that's trying to prevent your building from being built? So, every time The Arcadian comes up, you guys just awkwardly change the subject? That was on purpose! Babe, can I get you a drink? I know. Can you believe this one? Wants our booth. Keeps giving us the walk-by. The walk-by with the stink eye. Oh, boy. Look who's back. Excuse me waitress, I'll have a mojito! And you'll have a no-seat-ho. This stupid feud isn't going to end until Marshall and Barney finally talk about their feelings, cry, and then hug it out like they do on Oprah. Oh... Yes, but the right kind of drunk. Uh... we should go with something mellow. Maybe red wine? Oh... last time Marshall got gin-drunk was at that douchey bar Barney likes to go to. Marshall almost got in a fight that night. How about martinis? Why not? Ooh... You know what would be stupid? If we made out. That would be so stupid. Hey, I dare you guys to dare us to make out. I only say that because it would be so stupid if we did. So stupid... Oh, yeah? Well... what about you and absinthe? I keep telling you, that didn't happen. Maybe. When Marshall has daiquiris... he gets really into how beautiful he is. Peppermint schnapps? Who? Oh, wait, Ted. Do you have a specific reaction to any kind of alcohol? Yeah, Ted, I hate to tell you, but the bourbon only makes it sound good to you. Barney and Marshall's feud got us banned from the bar. We lost our booth. We've cross-referenced every alcohol with Marshall and Barney's reaction. What's the right drink for this situation? I-I guess. That... seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight. Yeah, we need a drink that, that takes subtext and turns it into text. Yeah. Yeah. We need to get them up and having fun. Now do you see why I'm always interfering in other people's lives? Okay. Final round. What simple act will get the boys to finally forgive each other? Again, just a whole other thing, sweetie. Where'd they go? Oh, no. They did shots. What's the worst thing they could possibly drink right now? Be well, my friends! Aw, just how we left them. I thought they made up last night. Carl, a round of champagne. Ooh! The champagne. Mama's done with this drama. What drink can fix the headache these clowns are giving me? Time is music the planets make. Music the planets make..."
1798,6,22,marshall ,"Yeah? And I'd sure love to give a rat's ass. Your move. Screw the environment! Sir, none of that is... Yeah, totally. Listen, um, I hate to go up against my two best friends, but... I really, I really need this right now. I mean, we're, we're cool, right? Barney, please... Oh! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! No, I'm still not... ready to put my mouth on anything yet. You know what? Screw this. Game on. Barney! Your wife just called from the hospital! It's a boy! Oh, bye-bye. Mr. Stinson... I had to rush down as soon as I got your results. I'm sorry, but your crabs have super-herpes. (The girl leaves in a hurry) Ah, yes... the sweet, smoky taste of victory. That's it! Oh, God! Ow... Why would you do that to your own jacket?! Oh, really? Really? Really. That... what... Look at this meatball. He's headed right towards me, showing me no respect. Well, if he wants to play chicken, this rooster ain't backing down! Oh. Mirror. I don't know. We could have water, soda, purple stuff... Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day? I showed up with wet hair once! Once! See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation. That's why The Arcadian speaks to me. Oh God, I didn't even think of that... Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney. I love you. Oh, yeah? Hey! Hey! Do you guys have some pancakes, because I... would really like some pancakes. They're fantastic. Let's be honest, I love them. But I hate this guy! I love you."
1799,6,22,robin ,"Wait. While no one wants to see a, uh, coyote wearing a little hard hat more than me, remember: Zoey's protest could still shut your whole project down. Wait, Marshall's helping you save The Arcadian, now. That bitch is not giving us the walk-by. Look, Lily, I think this girl wants our seats. Should we leave... or stay here Lionel Richie style ""All Night Long""? Ejected! Carl! Oh... This has nothing to do with us. You're totally ridiculous. (The girls stand up and leave the booth; the other girl sits down at their booth) Don't look, baby. Just don't look. Come on. Man, what are we going to do without her? Wait, you know what, these guys are not going to get all mushy sober. We need to get these bitches drunk. Oh, I don't know. Red wine has kind of an odd effect on Barney. He reaches a point of sad clarity. If we want them to open up, I say we go straight-up gin. Absolutely not. I'm not going anywhere near you and a martini. Every time. Uh-huh. We're a dream a baby's having. We're a dream a baby's having. It happened, and it changed me. How about daiquiris? No. Peppermint schnapps turns Barney into Richard Dawson. The crazy old host of Family Feud, who greeted women by kissing them on the mouth. Well, enjoy Martha's Vineyard. Hopefully by the time you get back, we'll be allowed back into MacLaren's. Stop. Well, they're not talking. They're not even looking at each other. That reminds me of those awkward Sunday dinners with my mom, my dad and his mistress. Families, right? Okay, now we need to get them something that will make them emotionally vulnerable and completely, pathetically honest. Wow. That got real o'clock. Dance, my puppets, dance! Oh, God, totally! Sharing a brandy. Which is what I walked in on my parents doing once. Brandy was my father's mistress. God, parents. Right? What? What is it? Well, what drink finally did the trick? Morning. Who wants breakfast? Damn it, I know what happened. We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing. Okay, what drink can fix this? I got it. Right?"
1800,6,22,ted ,"Dude, that's my girlfriend. You know it. At first, yes, but we figured out a great way to deal with it: we never talk about it. And since then, we've really been enjoying each other's company. Yeah, but you'd be surprised. It doesn't even come up that often. So Oprah's retiring. Oof! What's that world gonna be like? So, they found water on Mars. What? Hey, Marsh, you know that's another mirror, right? Hey, where are our chicken wings? Okay, I'm gonna go pick up Zoey, then we're off. See you Sunday. Bourbon. When I drink bourbon... I get weirdly good at beatboxing. Peace, I'm out. Peace. I'm out. You had to take that away from me, didn't you? (He takes a bottle of Bourbon out of his bag and put it on the table) What do you mean? Man, how did things get so screwed up? You and The Arcadian are ruining my life! What? We're talking about this. Look, I can handle you trying to prevent me from fulfilling a life-long dream. That's just being in a relationship. But now? You turn my best friend against me? Because he's going through a lot right now. He, he's looking for something to believe in, and you took advantage of that. You're, you're just like those Internet swindlers who tricked him into paying 300 bucks for a lock of Sasquatch fur. Okay. You know what? We're settling this once and for all. Well, here we are. I had a reservation at a four-star inn overlooking the ocean but, uh... How can that compete with such a beautiful, magnificent hotel? Welcome to The Arcadian. So here's the deal. If you can last until sunrise in your precious Arcadian, I'll join your side. That's not a chocolate. Dust just flew out of that comforter in the shape of a skull. Whoa, something just passed through me. Can you get STDs from the ghost of a prostitute? What are... What are you doing in our bathroom? Uh, these were supposed to be for a romantic dinner on our balcony as we were serenaded by the sounds of the ocean. But I guess we'll have to settle for what sounded like two very large men having s*x next door... with a third very small man. Okay. What is it? And don't give me, ""It's beautiful."" Don't give me, ""It's magnificent"" What is it about this place that makes you so passionate to save it? Why, why have you never told me that? I love you. You know, I guess this place isn't so bad. What was what? I don't see anything. Oh, my God! It's the cock-a-mouse! Cock-a-mouse. Part cockroach, part mouse. It used to live in our apartment. It must have settled here, and... Oh! Look, it had babies! Good for it. Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too."
1801,6,22,woman ,This bathroom for entire floor! What is that?
1802,6,22,zoey ,"If you want to get back at those jerks, I have a proposition for you. Hey, guys. Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian. Yeah. Having a former GNB employee on our side is huge for us. GNB is going down. Barney sent us pictures of himself. Oh, God. What's he doing to that megaphone?! I thought we weren't talking about... Marshall made his own choice. Why aren't you mad at him? You cannot compare The Arcadian to a Ziploc bag full of Turkish armpit hair. The Arcadian is a beautiful, magnificent hotel. Okay. You're on. This place is fantastic. They even left a chocolate on the pillow. Well, we're here for the night. Might as well have some fun. Dare to join me? I think that small man sounded very moved by The Arcadian's beauty. Well... When I was a little girl... my family used to live here. I never told anyone that. It makes it sound like it would be impossible for me to be objective, but... The truth is, I... I loved growing up here. We had just moved to New York. We were completely broke. But my mom told my sisters and me that The Arcadian was a castle. And we believed her. I know it's not what it used to be... but this building is a part of who I am. And that's why I want so badly for you to like it, too. I love you, too. See? With a little renovation, we could restore it to its former... What was that? I think it went under the bed. That, that was... that! The what? Ew.... I give up. You win. Let's go!"
1803,6,22,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when your Uncle Marshall finally quit Goliath National Bank to do something better with his life, he left on great terms with his boss. Ted from 2030: Which made Marshall's big interview with a respected environmental organization all the more confusing. Head of the environmental Organization: I'm sorry. I don't think you're the kind of person we're looking for. I just got off the phone with Arthur Hobbs over at GNB. Head of the environmental Organization: ""Screw the environment""?! Head of the environmental Organization: Sorry. Interview over. Ted from 2030: And so Marshall stormed over to GNB, where he ran into Zoey. Ted from 2030: And thus began an all-out war between Barney and Marshall... Ted from 2030: Later, back at the bar... another war was just beginning. Robin, in a high-pitched voice: A stink-eye-walk-by?! Aw, hell no! I hope this drink isn't teething, 'cause it's about to get nursed. Ted from 2030: This went on for days. Marshall, to the girl Barney is talking to: Congratulations. You're about to be the 250th girl that Barney has slept with. Marshall, talking to a mirror: Hey. I dare you guys to dare us to make out. Ted from 2030: Of course I knew the answer to that. I was dating her. But I wasn't about to ruin our first big romantic weekend away by bringing up the one topic we agreed was completely off-limits. Ted from 2030: Kids, don't drink tequila. Ted from 2030: Kids, you never forget the first time or place you tell a girl: Robin & Lily: Of course, beer."
1804,6,23,arthur ,"No, everything's not okay. My stupid wife got custody of Tugboat. God, I should have kept her hidden in a cage in the basement. I'm talking about my wife. Yeah, I know your friend Ted. No, Barney. I wouldn't just fire him. I'd also fire you. Have you already forgotten how Mosby got that job? No. No. Let me refresh your memory. We were in this very room. Really good. In fact, I just put all my assets in her name. Smartest thing I've ever done. No, you'd better make sure Mosby doesn't screw up tomorrow. Because either that building is going down, or you're going down. What is so difficult about this?! Tugboat figured this out in, like, five minutes. This is bush league! No! Tugboat, my other dog, that was a cute dog. This little disappointment is nothing but a cheap facsimile. I said it! Yeah, my love is reserved for dogs that go to the bathroom on command instead of wasting my time! Oh, his wife has an idea. Let me tell you about wives, okay? They leave you and take your best friend with them. You're not Tugboat! You'll never be Tugboat! I guess this one's kind of cute or whatever. So... so what's the idea? Fine! What's the idea?"
1805,6,23,audience ,Ah...
1806,6,23,barney ,"Okay, okay. A couple of things. Lily, how'd I do? Secondly, Ted, I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey. Are you really going to walk away from this project just because you're mad at me? I understand. Zoey has magic lady bits. Zoey's lady bits... are magic, and that's how she controls your mind. You see, every few hundred millennia, lady bits leap forward... I once knew such a girl. It was last call. In this very bar. What...?! No... What?!...No... What?! Come on. This is so about the girl. Oh, you're not sorry now, Ted Mosby. But you will be. You... will... be. (laughing harder and louder) That's how you do an evil laugh. Ciao for now. Hi, Arthur. Everything okay? Isn't that animal cruelty? Oh. That's fine, then. So listen, you know Ted, the architect? So, if Ted stood up at that big meeting tomorrow and said that he thought The Arcadian should be a landmark... You wouldn't just fire him, would you? (laughing uncomfortably) Right? You wouldn't just... You wouldn't just... yeah... Come again for Big Fudge? Can you believe that?! I can't be unemployed, Robin! My job is my identity; It's who I am. It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot. I don't understand. Why would you fire me? By being the best architect available? By... being Latino? Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, fire me. Damn it! I was kidding? I'm not kidding! Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife? We'll end up out of a job, all thanks to some stupid, only sort of awesome lion head. We should totally buy a bar! The only court where you show up, then get served. Oh, this ought to be good. Oh, this is good! Hey, Arthur! Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea for how we can save, not saving The Arcadian. Uh... Hey, Arthur? I don't know, she may have been right about that lion's head. It gave The Arcadian a regal elegance. Then again, it goes really nice with my duvet. (He takes out a normal size screw driver) I hope I used the right screws."
1807,6,23,barney and ted, Dibs.
1808,6,23,both ,Damn it!
1809,6,23,chairman ,"All right, thank you, Mr. Eriksen. We will now hear from the architect of the proposed GNB Tower, Ted Mosby. Now, uh, Mr. Mosby, let's just cut right to the chase. Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?...Okay, it's k*ll*ing me. What rhymes with ""beck and call?"" Mr. Mosby, do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? It's not a difficult question. Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? Mr. Mosby, I'm going to ask you one last time. Should The Arcadian be a landmark? Is that your voice, Mr. Mosby? Last night, this committee took a vote, and while we have all felt from the very beginning that The Arcadian is, well, an eyesore... Mr. Mosby's surprising testimony about the lion's head stonework left us no choice but to declare it... a landmark. But then, something else happened last night. That same lion's head stonework...disappeared. So... that makes our job a little easier. Motion denied."
1810,6,23,ghost ,"Who is this Barney? My name is John Clifford Larrabee, architect of The Arcadian. And I am visiting you in a dream... Look, it's a dream, it is. So just... okay? Theodore... heed my words: do not try to save The Arcadian. Theodore, you know The Arcadian is a badly built, architecturally unimportant rat's nest designed by an overpaid, plagiarizing ether addict with two thumbs. This guy. New York is never finished, Theodore. She's a lady only a handful of architects ever get to dance with. Do not miss your turn. Indeed. Mo' buildings, mo' problems. Mommy's got Magic Lady Bits, Ted."
1811,6,23,lily ,"All right, what's the message? 'Cause if it's another hypothetical yet eerily accurate drawing of my boobs... Damn it. Yeah. It's why in our apartment: If you're a-hopin' to score, don't leave your socks on the floor. I know you're only just getting started, but this is already gross. Wait. She's gonna let you name your kids Luke and Leia? Okay, what does Barney do at GNB? Tree? I've got to say, I'm with Ted on this. I mean, yes, this is a huge, divisive issue for them. Which means no matter what happens, there's gonna be a lot of resentment. Probably lasting for years... infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship. So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this. Just stop it! No one's buying a bar. Right now we have a little problem. Let's just think of a solution. Okay, first hear my demands. One, Ted and Barney keep their jobs. Two, when you guys do finally blow up The Arcadian, one of them gets to push the button. Well..."
1812,6,23,marshall ,"A symbol of strength and constancy, the stone lion of The Arcadian has watched over New Yorkers for generations. So remember: if the lion head stonework is regal, then tearing it down should be illegal. Well. Did you like that? All right, uh... We must make sure the lion is always there. Destroy The Arcadian? Oh, no, don't you dare. Yeah? Yeah? Okay. Try this one on for size... If you want New York's history at your beck and call... I just have... Wrecking ball. Don't go swinging no wrecking ball. Thank you. I'm sorry, I should have been more clear. Nice. Oh, we've got the big LPC meeting in two days. I have my whole presentation worked out. I just need to find a good rhyme to end on. If you end an argument with a rhyme, it's convincing all the time. And she hasn't since. Nailed it. And he's been doing it for years. He has a lot of keys. Better get used to that lion head. As of tomorrow, it's gonna be there till the end of times. And all because of my sweet, sweet rhymes. We should absolutely totally buy a bar! Oh, oh, and ready? It's a theme bar. It's a courtroom. I'll allow it! I don't know, homegirl is pretty diabolical. If there is a plan that'll get us out of this, it's somewhere inside this butter churn. She'll think of it. I'm just gonna sit here... and watch it happen. (Lily starts to jiggle) And she's got it! Lily, what's the plan?"
1813,6,23,robin ,"I have a message from Barney. Yeah, I have that, too. All right, here's the message. (clears throat, then reads Barney's note) ""Oh, hey, guys. Didn't see you there. I was too busy feelin' fine and..."" Really? ""Feelin' fine and gettin' some 'jine. You may have noticed the giant plate of hot wings in front of me. I know how much you love hot wings. Too bad someone bribed the kitchen to take them off the menu tonight. So, if you want some, you're going to have to come back to GNB. But hurry, this offer will be gone lickety-split. (Barney licks his hot wings peace by peace then throws them down) Do evil laugh."" Oh, um... (makes a poor impression of Barney's laugh) So, what are you turds up to? Um... thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story. I-I don't understand. Why would he fire you? Okay, Ted, can you just please think about this before you... Okay, Ted... you know I love Zoey. But, look, sometimes... I go play chess in the park. And the key to chess... Okay, I play online. But the key to chess... Okay, it's Angry Birds! But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario. The chairman asks you... You say... And Zoey dumps you on the spot. There's the second scenario. The chairman asks you... You say... And you're happy for, like, a second, until you realize the building you helped save has just become a monument to everything this woman made you give up, and you resent her for it, so much so, in fact, that you dump her. Right. The chairman asks you... But before you can answer...You're hit in the neck with a blow dart fired by the ninja Zoey's ex-husband hired to assassinate you. That one's less likely. What I'm saying... what I hate saying... is this. You and Zoey are gonna break up. But you can still save your career and Barney's. Thank you. They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place. It's really the only sensible idea right now. Ho! You're judged by a jury of your beers. Oh, cute dog!"
1814,6,23,ted ,"""Yes. The Arcadian should be a landmark."" And then the crowd gasps: ""Oh, my God! Did he really just say that? Oh, heavens! Oh, my stars! I must clutch my pearls!"" Almost exclusively. But here's my point: If they ask GNB's chief architect... aka me... if The Arcadian should be a landmark, and I say ""yes""? Dude! That's my girlfriend. And ya know what? I'm on her side now, too. Mmm. Love you, too. Why does it need to rhyme? It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been dead for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands. What? Barney, this is about the building. Okay, fine. It's about the girl! I am doing this for Zoey! I'm in love with her. Look, I know it's early, but there is a very good chance Zoey might be the mother of my children. So, in addition to doing this for John Clifford Larrabee, I'm also doing this for Luke and Leia. Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't. Barney, I'm sorry. They're going to fire him? That sucks. He loves that job. No idea. There's nothing to think about. I-I can't lose Zoey. That's the only thing that matters to me right now. No. Yes We're done here. You said there was a third scenario. Okay, first of all, no ninja's getting a jump on me. I have the reflexes of a jungle... (Robin slaps him by surprise) Second of all, I don't care that the odds are stacked against us. I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey than spend the rest of my life alone playing Angry Birds, which, by the way, I've shown you how to download, like, 20 times. Thank you. Barney, what are you doing? Really? 'Cause it feels more like my insane friend renting a costume and breaking into my apartment in the middle of the night for what I wish I could say was the first time. Barney, there's condoms in the drawer. Just take them and get out. Whoa! Lighting change! Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building, but... does that mean we have to knock it down? I mean, it's not bothering anyone. Just anyone who lives in it... Or looks at it... Or smells it. The Arcadian has to go, doesn't it? You realize this kind of screws up my personal life. This is a dream, right? Because, Barney, I swear to God, if that's you... ""Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair"""" Right. And I mistook you for a prostitute right... here. Worth every penny. No, we should get some sleep. But this was fun. Exactly. Yeah. Good night. No, it shouldn't be a landmark. There are a lot of important buildings in New York. The Arcadian isn't one of them. Yeah, that's me. This is a nightmare. I can't believe she kept that tape. The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow, and based on today... Yeah. What are we gonna do? We should buy a bar. Yes! Where the bartenders wear sexy judges' robes. That's not bad. Lily, it's over. The good guys lost. We have to find Arthur right now. Zoey... Zoey! I don't know. Sometimes... things have to fall apart to make way for better things. Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore. You may now say what you really think of Zoey."
1815,6,23,zoey ,"So these things are generally attended by old Southern ladies? That, no, that wasn't The Arcadian being destroyed; that was GNB's hopes of destroying The Arcadian. Yeah. The Arcadian's gonna be all like... Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian. What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead, sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?! Message from Barney? That's my cue to leave. Good night, guys. I love you. We're done here. Hello, Mr. Lion. Hey, I met you right...(laughs)...here. As far as you know, I still could be one. And you, my good man, have run up quite a tab. All right... this was fun. I'm gonna take this cab. Big day tomorrow. We need to get some sleep. And yet... Yeah. It's nice getting one last look to remember what we're trying to save. You okay? E-Excuse me, I have a question for Mr. Mosby. If he doesn't think The Arcadian's worth saving, then whose voice is this? (She plays a recorder) All right, what do you have to say for yourself? We're done here."
1816,6,23,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, this is a story of landmarks. There are certain moments in life when you have to decide which things you can stand to see torn down, and which things you have to preserve, no matter what. Such a moment came for all of us in May of 2011, at a special meeting of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, where the fate of The Arcadian would be decided once and for all. Ted from 2030: Actually, it a difficult question. Of course, had he asked me a few days earlier, I would have immediately said... Ted from 2030: Things between Barney and the rest of us had gotten a little frosty. First this happened. Ted from 2030: And then this happened. Ted from 2030: Which led to this happening. Ted from 2030: Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs, Barney and Marshall's old boss at GNB? Well, Arthur was going through a divorce and taking it kind of hard. Ted from 2030: That night, as I slept soundly... Ghost, shouting dramatically: I am not... Barney... Ted, panting: Dream! Dream! It was just a dream. (He takes his breath again, then phones Zoey) Hey. I know it's late, but, uh... you want to meet up? Ted, on recorder: The Arcadian should be a landmark. It should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of... wieners and gonads. Ted from 2030: And then Lily told us her plan. Ted from 2030: Kids, for legal reasons, I have to skip this part of the story and jump ahead to the next night, as the Landmarks Preservation Commission gave their verdict."

1818,6,24,barney ,"I want to press it! I want to press it! You know what might... make you feel better, buddy? I want to press the button! Yeah. Getting to stand next to me while I press the button. That is going to be legend... wait for it...dary adjacent. Legendary adjacent! Are these people Irish, Polish, blondes... what are we dealing with here? Not possible. Your building is new. And I have one rule: New is always better. Ah, but ""new is always better"" is my oldest rule, which makes it the best. Oh, hey, buddy. I wonder what end it's coming out of Lily right now. I bet it's both. Hey, speaking of explosions... enough already, Ted! That button's mine! I got you this job, so I... Say what? You... Who's that from? Why would Ted get back together with Zoey? He's doing great. No, I refuse to believe that Ted is getting back with Zoey because of lightbulbs. Ted, I only have one rule. We've got to stop Ted. Where are they meeting? Well, that's good. All we have to do is think back to the time Ted told us about his first date with Zoey. You weren't listening either? That's the intersection. Way ahead of ya. I know. They're a total train wreck. Yeah, almost as bad as us. What about me? I got so fat, at the end of a date, you'd unhook my bra. Thank God we're not sentimental saps who panic and get back together. Seriously, why would people do that? What do you mean? Yeah... he did. And... she loved him, too. Didn't she? Maybe this isn't the intersection. She's alone! There's still time! But where the hell is Ted? Brilliant. But wait, he had a huge head start on us. There's no way he's still in there unless he spent a half an hour picking out the perfect orchid. But... it's a mistake. He is. Yeah. You earned it. Always. It's just a button. Can we talk about something else, please? (Barney sees Norah, Robin says something to him that we can""t hear, then Barney walks up to Norah) Norah. How you been? Look, I don't know why you would possibly say yes to this, but would you want to grab a cup of coffee with me sometime? 20 minutes. I was such a jerk to you. You can spend the entire time calling me every dirty name in the book. I'll call you. You look beautiful, by the way. And here I thought it was too late for sundresses. Challenge accepted. What do you think of this tie?"

1820,6,24,foreman ,"Hey, hotshot."
1821,6,24,jake ,"Hey. Oh, I'm sorry about the stench. We're suing a factory that's been dumping raw sewage into a local marshland. Yeah, ten minutes ago, I was knee-deep in liquefied human feces. And that was just on the F train. So, let me show you some of the gut-wrenching environmental atrocities that we were working to stop, okay? Here, pop quiz. What is that? Bingo! Yes, a bloated seal corpse rotting in industrial waste. Now, wait till you see what we found when we cut him open. Now, do you know what that is? Being eaten by rats. Exactly. Now this next slide... Oh, I'm sorry. That's my wife's water birth. I don't know how that got in there. Anyway, that's all my questions. Now, I like to set aside 20 minutes at the end of every interview for your questions. So don't hold back. Whatever you got inside there, you just let 'er rip."

And when he gets back home, he is going to find his favorite soup there waiting for him. Three times. But they're really nice about it. Their policy is, ""Get sick, get a free gallon of soup"". This is Mr. Buttons 2. Now, after what happened to Mr. Buttons 1, we have to be very gentle with... (Lily throws up onto Mr. Buttons 2. She leaves the shool, running to her apartment in order to stop Marshall from eating the soup) Marshall! Don't eat the soup! Oh, thank God. Oh, baby, can you just hold me, please? Mm. Thanks. Wait, you didn't tell them I had food poisoning, did you? Marshall, when it's stomach stuff, you just say ""under the weather,"" or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things. Oh, but, baby, what if you hit the jackpot early? Yeah, I wasn't listening, either. Ted really can go on about a bitch. Hey, wait. Ted left a message. I could hear it 'cause I was in the bathroom... blowing my nose... I have the sniffles. Damn it, Marshall. Wait, wait, wait. That's was a subway announcement in the background. I speak conductor. Got it. Ted's at... (Lily runs to the bathroom and throws up) Oh... Ted's at Smith and Ninth Street. When it's stomach stuff, you just say ""under the weather"" or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things. Nailed it. Hey, baby, how'd it go? Baby, come here. I know, baby. I'm pregnant. Best man? You're being summoned."
1823,6,24,man ,"Marshall. Jake Bloom. Great to meet you. I know, right? Ever since the Trader Joe's opened up, Brooklyn is so... whatever. Across the street at the Intersection. So, uh, you guys... want to buy some weed or...?"
1824,6,24,marshall ,"This was about to be my third bowl. Why shouldn't I eat the soup? Why shouldn't I eat the soup? Lily got food poisoning from some soup. And then I ate the soup exactly three hours later. Which means I can see exactly three hours into my future, and it... doesn't... look... good. I tried to be supportive. Of course, baby. (He hesitates, then put one finger onto her back) But it doesn't help it that when Lily gets going; she sounds like a velociraptor from Jurassic Park. But then I realized a man can do a lot of living in three hours. So, I'm out experiencing this beautiful, crazy dance called life. Ah, my last meal. MacClaren's famous jalapeno poppers. My doctor says I need to eat healthier, so I figured the round-trip flight these babies are about to take will land them permanently on the no-fry list. Good-bye, my friend. It's been a hell of a ride. I have to... Hey, babe. The gang says feel better. Um, I... I know. I just said that you had the sniffles. No one is picturing anything but little red-nosed you under a blankie with some hot tea. According to my calculations, at 6:00 p.m., my body is gonna pay out like the most disgusting slot machine in the world. That gives me two hours to go do the interview and still get back in time. Don't worry. I'll be prepared. Can... I... borrow... an adult diaper? Hello, hi. That's a seal. Mm-hmm. A pile of rotting seagull carcasses covered in toxic sludge. I have food poisoning and I'm about to start volcanoing toxic sludge out of both ends! (Marshall leaves in a hurry) Lily, this year, this nasty schoolyard bully of a year will not stop punching me in the face. How did we kick off 2011? My dad died. And now after five months of unemployment, I just blew my dream job. The good news is, in a few seconds, I'm gonna start heaving my guts out because that's what life is for me now: just losing what's inside until I'm just empty. I just want to shut my eyes for a few seconds before it starts. (He lyes down onto the bed and falls asleep) Lily, it's a miracle. I didn't get sick. I didn't get sick."

1827,6,24,ranjit ,Hello! Worst couple ever. Smith and Ninth Street.
1828,6,24,robin ,"Guys, I dated you both, and neither of you is good at pressing or even finding the button. After some awkward pawing around, that building's going to fake an implosion, say, ""Baby, that was great"""" and go to sleep. It's just a button, okay? Can we just talk about something else, please? That's the first time since the breakup. How's she doing? You know that ""coffee"" is code for ""I want to get back together"" right? Oh, that's sweet, Lil, but didn't you guys get food poisoning here one time? Hey, Mr. Architect, big day for you tomorrow, huh? You okay? Hey. Everything okay? I bet it's her tushie. Why would Ted just give up the button like that? And he forgot his phone. ""See you in an hour."" Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her! After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back. Uh, Ted's gone back for less. Get it together, bro. Okay, Zoey wrote, ""Meet me at 6:00, where it all began, where you gave me the orchid at the intersection."" Aw, that's sweet. I was in a coma. I mean, who pays attention to that sappy romantic crap? Great. He could be anywhere. We're flat out of clues. Okay, we're never gonna find him. That's in Brooklyn. How are we ever gonna get there in time? I can't believe Ted's getting back together with Zoey. Unmitigated disaster. We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched. You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated. I guess I get it. Well, no matter how bad things got... Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he? Yeah, she did. Okay, where the hell are they? Well, maybe it is and we're too late. Man, I wish we'd gone to Brooklyn sooner. Wait. Where'd you get that? (The guy is holding a cup, on which is printed ""The Intersection"") Wait a minute. On their first date, he brought her an orchid. How much do you want to bet he's gonna do it again? You can't get back together with Zoey just because you're freaking out over a lightbulb. Look, Ted, the future is scary. But you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar. Yes, it's tempting. I'm proud of you for giving Ted the button. It meant a lot."
1829,6,24,rod ,"Yeah, but you're such a hotshot, I figured I'd just call you hotshot. Pick one. And make sure you like it. There's going to be 50,000 of these in your big, hotshot building, hotshot. Okay, hotshot. Mr. Stinson. Who's gonna do the honors? All clear! Ten, nine, eight..."
1830,6,24,ted ,"I want to press the button to blow up The Arcadian! I want to press it! Well, I ran into Zoey yesterday. Saving money. Making new friends. No downside. Well, I can tell you're really busy so I should... I'll let you go. Well, at first I wasn't sure, but then she said something that got me thinking. Don't worry, we're not. I just, I feel bad Zoey's having such a hard time. I'm not letting you press the button. You're not pressing the button! It's my button! Yeah... no. This morning I was talking to the foreman. You know, Rod, um, I'm loving that nickname, and I can tell it's totally affectionate, but, uh, I'd prefer Ted. 50,000 lightbulbs! What if this one's too bright? What if this one flickers and gives everyone a weird headache? Do you know how many people it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs? There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks? You can't keep saying you have one rule if they're always different rules. Hi, Marsh. Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run. (Ted leaves the Bar) Hi, Natalie. You want to get coffee sometime? Bro. But I can't reach the worst part. (He picks his phone and calls someone) Hi, Karen. Want to get coffee sometime? Robin, you want to get coffee sometime...? Amazing first date with Zoey! We met at the intersection... (The rest is unintelligible) Thanks, Julia! No, on second thought. (Barney and Robin jumps on him, all three fall down)Ooh! Come on. What the hell?! I'm not freaking out over a lightbulb! I'm freaking out over 50,000 lightbulbs! I can't do this! I only got this job because you gave it to me, Barney. I didn't earn it! You're right. (Ted stops an elderly woman who was about to enter the Intersection) Um, excuse me. Can you give this to the blonde sitting alone in there and tell her Ted's really sorry? Also... indirect sunlight. Don't overwater. Half a cup a week is more than enough. (The elderly woman enters and gives theflowers to a blonde sitting alone, but not the right one) No. Hi. You sure? Hey, new is always better, right? Geez, what now? (He goes inside, enters a room) I heard the groom needed me."
1831,6,24,ted's voice," Hey, Lily, hope you're feeling better. Marshall told us you're exploding from both ends like a busted fire hydrant.  Anyway, listen, I was going to get back together with Zoey today, but I came to my senses on the way out here, so... False alarm... Oh, crap. Just stepped in some gum. I'm getting back together with Zoey!"
1832,6,24,voice ,"Hey, Lily, hope you're feeling better. Marshall told us..."
1833,6,24,zoey ,"I'm still unemployed, so I had to get a couple roommates. They're all 22 and sell drugs. Which means they're not taking them. So, that's a win. Hey. You want to get coffee sometime? I want to get back together."
1834,6,24,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, in the spring of 2011, Zoey and I broke up. But the good news: Goliath National Bank was finally ready to demolish The Arcadian and build the new headquarters I'd designed for them. (A committee, including Ted holding a big pair of scissors, is standing behind a red ruban. Ted is going to cut it, when a very happy Barney arrives with a bigger pair of scissors and cut the ruban before Ted can) The only problem was... I kept butting heads with my project supervisor on one very important issue. Both Ted and Barney, at the same time: She means you. I want to press it! I'm gonna press it! Ted from 2030: Sadly, that's all you need to know about my summer. Now, around this time, Uncle Marshall was still having a tough time finding a job. Ted from 2030: And so, Lily dropped off Marshall's surprise soup and headed back to work to introduce the new class pet. Ted, while texting on his phone: Yeah, fine, okay. Marshall, picking up his phone: Hello?... Yes, it is. (To Lily) It's Bloom, Greenberg and Associates. They want me to come interview. (Lily throws up) I know it's risky to go, but this is the best environmental law firm in New York. It's my dream job. (Lily throws up) That's a great idea, babe. I'll ask them. (In his phone) Hey, is it at all possible, could I come in on Monday?... Okay, I'll, I'll see you at 5:00. (Marshall hangs up) Thank you. I love and believe in you, too, baby. Ted, leaving the florist's shop: Thanks, Julia! You know what? Let me see the pink lady slipper again. (He goes back inside) Marshall, thinking: Oh, my God, I made it! Now just shake his hand, clench your very soul and run like hell! Marshall, thinking: I can't do this anymore. I'm just gonna tell him the truth. Ted from 2030: And kids... that's how I met your mother. Psych. It was just some chick. Ted from 2030: And Marshall slept...all night. Rod:...one!"
