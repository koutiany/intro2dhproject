21,1,1,Ted ,"You know, ever since college it's been Marshall and Lily and me. Now it's going to be Marshall and Lily... and me. They'll get married, start a family-before long I'm the weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call ""Uncle Ted"".",22,22

77,1,1,Narrator ,and there she was.,78,78

109,1,1,Ted ,Sort of looks like a... Smurf pen1s.,110,110
110,1,1,Narrator ,"Son, a piece of advice. When you go on a first date you really don't wanna say ""smurf pen1s"". Girls don't ordinarily like that.",111,111

225,1,1,Marshall ,"Yeah, I'm scared, okay? But when I think about spending the rest of my life with Lily... committing forever, no other women (Lily appears behind Marshall in the open window) doesn't scare me at all. I'm marrying that girl.

245,1,1,Ted ,"(upset/tired) Thanks. (Walks down the steps. Robin begins to walk in) You know what? (Robin stops. Ted turns around). I'm done being single. I'm not good at it. Look, obviously you can't tell a woman you just met you love her. But... it sucks that you can't. I'll tell you something though, if a woman-not you... just some hypothetical woman-were to bare with me through all this. I think I'd make a damn good husband. Because that's the stuff I'd be good at. Stuff like making her laugh and being a good father... and walking her five hypothetical dogs. Being a good kisser.",246,246
246,1,1,Robin ,Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.,247,247

285,1,2,Robin ,What?,10,286
286,1,2,Daughter ,"Oh, Dad.",11,287
287,1,2,Son ,So then what happened?,12,288
288,1,2,Narrator ,"Nothing. I mean, I made a complete fool of myself. So... a week went by and I decided not to call her.",13,289
289,1,2,Marshall ,"So you're not goanna call her? You went from, ""I think I'm in love with you"" to ""I'm not gonna call her?""",14,290
290,1,2,Ted ,"I wasn't in love with her, okay? I was briefly in love with the abstract idea of getting married! That had absolutely nothing to do with Robin. (Finds Lily and Robin chatting at a table.) Robin!",15,291

311,1,2,Robin ,"Oh, totally. I mean, he's sweet, he's charming, he's just looking for something a little bit more serious than I am. I mean the most I can handle right now is something casual. This just stays between us, right?",36,312
312,1,2,Lily ,Are you kidding? This flapper-for knocks.,37,313
313,1,2,Lily ,(shy) Oops...,38,314
314,1,2,Ted ,"She wants casual. Okay, I'll be casual. I'm gonna be a mushroom cloud of casual. You know why? Cause it's a game! I wanted to skip to the end and do the ""happily ever after"" thing but you don't get there unless you play the game.",39,315
315,1,2,Marshall ,So're you gonna ask her out?,40,316
316,1,2,Ted ,"Yeah-No! I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out I'm asking her out. So how do I ask her out, without asking her out? (thinks)",41,317

323,1,2,Marshall ,Alright-so call her up!,48,324

325,1,2,Lily ,"that's great, Ted. You'll be the most ""Casual"" stalker ever.",50,326

328,1,2,Lily ,"Hey, I'm just sitting here. Wearing my ring... my beautiful ring. Kind of makes wearing other stuff seem wrong. Like my shirt. Kind of don't wanna wear my shirt anymore. Or... my underwear. Oh-that's right-I'm not wearing any.",53,329

So Robin strolls over and I casually give her one of these, ""Hey, what's up?"" She says, ""Hey, nice place"" etcetera, etcetera. And then I say, ""Well make yourself at home,"" and I casually return to my conversation. Then, an hour later, ""Oh, you're still here?"" I say like I don't really care, but it's a nice surprise.

483,1,2,Ted ,"No, I'm not.",208,484
484,1,2,Robin ,"Yes, you are. I don't wanna get married right now, maybe ever and if we got together I'd feel like I'd either have to marry you or break your heart and-I just couldn't do either of those things. Just like you can't turn off the way you feel.",209,485

877,1,4,Lily ,"Not exactly the point I was trying to make, Marshall. That is a terrible way to break up with someone.",93,878
878,1,4,Marshall ,"Okay, in my client's defense. Is there an unterrible way to break up with somebody? No. Personally I'd rather hear the bad news on an answering machine than face the humiliation in person. (Lily Picks up her phone) It's the least painful way you can do it.

942,1,4,Lily ,"Well, I think Natalie deserves better.",158,943
943,1,4,Marshall ,Better. There's no better in breaking up. There's only less awful. A cliché's a cliché for a reason. It's comforting.,159,944

952,1,4,Marshall ,"Oh, you can't tell her that. That's horrible.",168,953
953,1,4,Lily ,Why? What is so horrible about that?,169,954
954,1,4,Ted ,"Yeah, what is so horrible about that?...""She's not the one."" Why is that such a heart-breaking thing to hear? The chances of one person being another person's ""The one"" are like six billion to one.",170,955
955,1,4,Lily ,"Yeah, you have better chances of winning the lottery.",171,956
956,1,4,Ted ,"Exactly, you wouldn't take it personally if you lost the lottery.",172,957

1494,1,6,Robin ,I like being with you.,226,1495

1503,1,6,Ted ,"Uh, excuse me, this is gonna sound crazy, but I met someone up on this roof four years ago and they mixed that cocktail and they loved penguins. By any chance, was that you? It's you. I was crazy but I can't...",235,1504
1504,1,6,Barney ,"You are such a loser. Come on, I came back for you, Ted. I penguin-suited up to show you the error of your ways. And to score hula girl's number. Check and check.",236,1505
1505,1,6,Ted ,Unbelievable.,237,1506
1506,1,6,Barney ,"Yes, it is.",238,1507
1507,1,6,Hula Girl, Wait a minute. You're that lame army guy.,239,1508
1508,1,6,Barney ,"What? No no, that's some other guy and he was a kick-ass fighter pilot",240,1509
1509,1,6,Hula Girl, I cannot believe I gave you my number,241,1510
1510,1,6,Barney ,"Yeah, well, you did, thanks.",242,1511
1511,1,6,Hula girl," Well, give it back.",243,1512
1512,1,6,Barney ,"Uh, I don't think so. I earned it fair and square. I'm calling you.",244,1513
1513,1,6,Hula Girl, But I'm never gonna go out with you.,245,1514
1514,1,6,Barney ,But how will you know it's me? I'm a master of disguise. Yeah.,246,1515
1515,1,6,Ted ,Nice.,247,1516
1516,1,6,Barney ,"Come on, Ted, Victoria's Secret party now. Let's go.",248,1517
1517,1,6,Ted ,I'm staying.,249,1518
1518,1,6,Barney ,Fine. Fine. (puts his flipper up towards Ted),250,1519
1519,1,6,Ted ,What are you doing?,251,1520
1520,1,6,Barney ,I'm flippering you off.,252,1521
1521,1,6,Lily ,"Sweetie, I'm so sorry.",253,1522
1522,1,6,Robin ,"Seriously it's not a big deal. He wanted to be a 'we,' and I wanted to be an 'I'. Dudes are such chicks. You guys, I'm fine.",254,1523
1523,1,6,Carl ,"Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in. And the winners of this year's costume contest are Lily Aldrin as a parrot and Marshall Eriksen as a gay pirate.",255,1524
1524,1,6,Marshall ,Oh yeah!,256,1525
1525,1,6,Marshall ,Wait. What did he say?,257,1526
1526,1,6,Lily ,"Oh, who cares, Marshall? We won!",258,1527
1527,1,6,Marshall ,"Gay pirate, where are you getting that from?",259,1528
1528,1,6,Carl ,"Dude, you're wearing eye liner.",260,1529
1529,1,6,Marshall ,"OK, I just want everybody here to know that I'm not a gay pirate. I have s*x with my parrot all the time. That came out wrong. Oh yeah, it doesn't matter! We won!",261,1530
1530,1,6,Lily ,"I love you, Marshmallow.",262,1531
1531,1,6,Marshall ,"I love you too, Lilypad.",263,1532
1532,1,6,Robin ,"You guys, let me get a picture.",264,1533
1533,1,6,Robin ,I had a feeling I'd find you here.,265,1534
1534,1,6,Ted ,"Hey. If you're here for the Shagarats, you just missed the fourth encore.",266,1535
1535,1,6,Robin ,I never played any team sports,267,1536
1536,1,6,Ted ,Are we playing 'I never' cuz there's nothing left but peach schnapps.,268,1537
1537,1,6,Robin ,I played tennis in high school. You know why? Because it was just me out there. I couldn't even stand playing doubles. I just got dumped.,269,1538
1538,1,6,Ted ,"Man, that sucks.",270,1539
1539,1,6,Robin ,"Yeah, it's OK. I wasn't that into him. Story of my life. Everyone else is all falling in love and acting stupid and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me. Why don't I want that more? I want to want that. Am I wired wrong or something?",271,1540
1540,1,6,Ted ,"No. Look, you didn't want to be with me so clearly you have abysmal taste in men.",272,1541
1541,1,6,Ted ,But you're wired just fine.,273,1542
1542,1,6,Robin ,"Well, what if I'm just a cold person? Tonight, Mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but I couldn't be Gretel. Why can't I be Gretel?",274,1543
1543,1,6,Ted ,Because you just haven't met the right Hansel yet. One day you're gonna meet a guy who's gonna make you want to look like a complete idiot.,275,1544
1544,1,6,Robin ,Really?,276,1545
1545,1,6,Ted ,"Yeah, he's out there somewhere, just like the Slutty Pumpkin. (echoes) pumpkin-pumpkin...",277,1546
1546,1,6,Robin ,"How do you do this, Ted? How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up.",278,1547
1547,1,6,Ted ,"Well, I'm pretty drunk. Look, I know that odds are the love of my life isn't going to magically walk through that door in a pumpkin costume at 2:43 in the morning but it seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know, sit and wait.",279,1548
1548,1,6,Robin ,Scoot.,280,1549
1549,1,7,Future Ted," Kids, before I met your mother, when I was still out there searching, I learned something valuable, that love is not a science.",1,1550
1550,1,7,Daughter ,"Wow, that was a great story, Dad.",2,1551
1551,1,7,Son ,We're gonna go watch TV.,3,1552
1552,1,7,Future Ted," You see, sometimes in life, you just have to accept that certain things can't be explained. And that's kinda scary.",4,1553
1553,1,7,Marshall ,Oh my God.,5,1554
1554,1,7,Lily ,"I know, I'm still shaking.",6,1555
1555,1,7,Barney ,"What the? Haha, joke's on you, I have a cold.",7,1556
1556,1,7,Robin ,Are you guys OK? Marshall (yelling over to bartender): Another round and back it up for me and Lily.,8,1557
1557,1,7,Ted ,What happened?,9,1558
1558,1,7,Marshall ,"We saw something, up in the apartment.",10,1559
1559,1,7,Lily ,Something bad.,11,1560
1560,1,7,Marshall ,"I don't know what it is, but margaritas make me sexy.",12,1561
1561,1,7,Lily ,"Oh, mucho sexy. You quiero Marshall.",13,1562
1562,1,7,Lily ,Oh my God.,14,1563
1563,1,7,Ted ,What was it?,15,1564
1564,1,7,Marshall ,"Only the craziest, meanest looking mouse you've ever seen.",16,1565
1565,1,7,Lily ,"Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse. That was a huge cockroach.",17,1566
1566,1,7,Marshall ,"Baby, it was a mouse. It had a whiskers.",18,1567
1567,1,7,Lily ,"But those things coming out of his head, those were antennae",19,1568
1568,1,7,Barney ,Marshall ran away from a cockroach.,20,1569
1569,1,7,Marshall ,"It, it was a mouse.",21,1570
1570,1,7,Barney ,"Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.",22,1571
1571,1,7,Robin ,"Ooh, my story's on. Ted, pay attention. Carl, turn it up.",23,1572
1572,1,7,Robin ,"I'm here with Ellen Pierce, New York's premiere matchmaker. Ellen, your company, Love Solutions boasts a 100% success rate. What's your secret?",24,1573
1573,1,7,Ellen ,"Science. Everything in life can be broken down to ones and zeros, even love.",25,1574
1574,1,7,Robin ,"Love Solution's Ellen Pierce, a beacon of hope for New York city's lovelorn. Robin Scherbatsky...",26,1575
1575,1,7,Barney ,Was that chick at the end really a client?,27,1576
1576,1,7,Robin ,Yes.,28,1577
1577,1,7,Barney ,We're signing up.,29,1578
1578,1,7,Ted ,What?,30,1579
1579,1,7,Barney ,"Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot. That's a perfect cocktail. Shake well, then sleep with.",31,1580
1580,1,7,Ted ,I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up. It's the man version of getting a cat.,32,1581
1581,1,7,Marshall ,"No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur and only mammals have fur.",33,1582
1582,1,7,Lily ,It was a cockroach.,34,1583
1583,1,7,Marshall ,"Come on, Lily, the only way that that was a cockroach was if it was wearing the skin of a mouse it just k*lled.",35,1584
1584,1,7,Lily ,Oh my God.,36,1585
1585,1,7,Barney ,Come on.,37,1586
1586,1,7,Barney ,"Ted, hurry, you gotta help me. My boat is sinking.",38,1587
1587,1,7,Ted ,What?,39,1588
1588,1,7,Barney ,My boat is sinking.,40,1589
1589,1,7,Ted ,You have a boat?,41,1590
1590,1,7,Ted ,Your boat is sinking. That was good.,42,1591
1591,1,7,Barney ,"Come on, Ted, this is an incredible opportunity. We'll meet our soulmates, nail 'em and never call them again. (chuckles)",43,1592
1592,1,7,Ellen ,"All finished, gentlemen? Congratulations, you have just taken your very first step.",44,1593
1593,1,7,Barney ,"Gosh, thanks, Ellen. I sure hope this works. I'm so done with the single life, all the games, the meaningless s*x.",45,1594
1594,1,7,Ellen ,You deserve more.,46,1595
1595,1,7,Barney ,"That is so true, Ellen. I really think I'm ready to stop being a me and start being a we.",47,1596
1596,1,7,Ellen ,"Oh, of course you can. That is so...",48,1597
1597,1,7,Barney ,"It's kinda hard to talk about with Ted here, but I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night when the tears come. Ellen, can you help me find her?",49,1598
1598,1,7,Ellen ,Get out.,50,1599
1599,1,7,Barney ,What?,51,1600
1600,1,7,Ellen ,"I get 15 guys like you every week. Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call them again.",52,1601
1601,1,7,Barney ,"Oh my God, people do that.",53,1602
1602,1,7,Ellen ,You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way?,54,1603
1603,1,7,Barney ,What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?,55,1604
1604,1,7,Ellen ,That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.,56,1605
1605,1,7,Barney ,"OK, Ted, let's go.",57,1606
1606,1,7,Ellen ,"Not you, you stay.",58,1607
1607,1,7,Ellen ,"You're cute. You're an architect. Good career and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application like your friend, Jack Package.",59,1608
1608,1,7,Barney (through office door) ,It's pronounced 'Pa-kojj.',60,1609
1609,1,7,Ellen ,Get outta here!,61,1610
1610,1,7,Ellen ,You I can work with. You give me three days and I will find the woman you will marry.,62,1611
1611,1,7,Ted ,"Ah, no thanks. I don't need an algorithm to meet women. It's New York City. You know, plenty of fish in the sea.",63,1612
1612,1,7,Ellen ,"Plenty of fish in the sea. Yes, there's 9 million people in New York, 4.5 million women. Of course you wanna meet someone roughly your own age, let's say, plus minus 5 years. So if we take into account the most recent census data, that leaves us with 482,000. But, uh, wait",64,1613
1613,1,7,Ted ,"That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?",65,1614
1614,1,7,Ellen ,"There are 8 fish in that big, blue ocean, Ted. And if you feel confident that you can reel one into your boat without me, there's the door.",66,1615
1615,1,7,Ted ,Do you take credit cards?,67,1616
1616,1,7,Lily ,"OK, it's back and this time we got a good look.",68,1617
1617,1,7,Barney ,"Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that.",69,1618
1618,1,7,Marshall ,It's bigger now. It's been feeding.,70,1619
1619,1,7,Lily ,We were just upstairs watching TV.,71,1620
1620,1,7,Marshall ,Ah gosh.,72,1621
1621,1,7,Lily ,"OK, let's do this.",73,1622
1622,1,7,Marshall ,"Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over.",74,1623
1623,1,7,Barney ,So did you get a good look at it?,75,1624
1624,1,7,Lily ,"Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton like a roach...",76,1625
1625,1,7,Marshall ,"But it has mouse-like characteristics. Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail.",77,1626
1626,1,7,Robin ,"So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?",78,1627
1627,1,7,Lily ,It's a cockamouse.,79,1628
1628,1,7,Robin ,What?,80,1629
1629,1,7,Lily ,It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know...,81,1630
1630,1,7,Barney ,Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha?,82,1631
1631,1,7,Robin ,That's impossible. That simply can't happen.,83,1632
1632,1,7,Lily ,"Oh, but it can.",84,1633
1633,1,7,Marshall ,And it has,85,1634
1634,1,7,Lily ,And it's pissed.,86,1635
1635,1,7,Ted ,"Dude, is everything OK? You left the front door open.",87,1636
1636,1,7,Marshall ,There was no time.,88,1637
1637,1,7,Robin ,"So Love Solutions, did you meet the love of your life?",89,1638
1638,1,7,Ted ,She said it'd take three days. It's been five days. Should I be worried?,90,1639
1639,1,7,Lily ,"Oh, just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.",91,1640
1640,1,7,Ted ,Did you just use my name as a verb?,92,1641
1641,1,7,Barney ,"Oh, yeah, we do that behind your back. Ted-out: to overthink. Also see Ted-up. Ted-up: to overthink something with disastrous results. Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when",93,1642
1642,1,7,Ted ,"OK, I get it. Don't worry, I'm not gonna ted anything up or out. I'll just give it a few more days.",94,1643
1643,1,7,Ted ,"Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.",95,1644
1644,1,7,Ellen ,"Ted, hi. I meant to call you. The computer is still crunching the numbers. Busy as a bee, that little computer.",96,1645
1645,1,7,Ted ,You said it was gonna be three days.,97,1646
1646,1,7,Ellen ,Did I?,98,1647
1647,1,7,Ted ,Hm.,99,1648
1648,1,7,Ellen ,Three days? Really?,100,1649
1649,1,7,Ted ,"Yeah. When someone says you're gonna meet the perfect woman in three days, you gotta put that in your datebook, so...",101,1650
1650,1,7,Ellen ,"How do I say this? This is gonna be really hard. Ted, there are absolutely no women out there for you. Phew, actually I got through that OK.",102,1651
1651,1,7,Ted ,There are no women for me out there? I thought you said there were 8.,103,1652
1652,1,7,Ellen ,I know. There are supposed to be. I don't know where they are.,104,1653
1653,1,7,Ted ,"But, I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute. I'm a cute architect.",105,1654
1654,1,7,Ellen ,How do you think I feel? I have a 100% success rate. It's my hook. I could probably find somebody for you if you were gay.,106,1655
1655,1,7,Ted ,"Well, I'm not.",107,1656
1656,1,7,Ellen ,A little bi maybe?,108,1657
1657,1,7,Ted ,"No. You're messing with me, right?",109,1658
1658,1,7,Ellen ,Come see for yourself.,110,1659
1659,1,7,Ellen ,"I cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 or higher, and look, 5.4, 4.8, 5.6...",111,1660
1660,1,7,Ted ,There's a 9.6 right there.,112,1661
1661,1,7,Ellen ,"Don't touch the computer. Yes, Sarah O'Brien. I fixed her up six months ago. She would have been absolutely perfect for you.",113,1662
1662,1,7,Ted ,What about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?,114,1663
1663,1,7,Ellen ,8.5.,115,1664
1664,1,7,Ted ,So he sucks.,116,1665
1665,1,7,Ellen ,"No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient.",117,1666
1666,1,7,Ted ,"Oh, sure, it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?",118,1667
1667,1,7,Ellen ,"Yes, 9.6 is off the charts, but Sarah is matched up. Ted, look, I have a lunch. Please. I promise we will find you somebody. Don't lose hope. There are new women turning 18 every day.",119,1668
1668,1,7,Lily ,He's a whole new species. The cockamouse.,120,1669
1669,1,7,Marshall ,And it's the size of a potato.,121,1670
1670,1,7,Robin ,"So, what, now it's a cockapotatomouse?",122,1671
1671,1,7,Marshall ,Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cockamouse.,123,1672
1672,1,7,Ted ,"My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.",124,1673
1673,1,7,Barney ,"Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman.",125,1674
1674,1,7,Marshall ,And like the majestic seahorse it's hermaphroditic.,126,1675
1675,1,7,Lily ,Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.,127,1676
1676,1,7,Marshall ,"For as much as we know about the cockamousse, there are still so much we don't know.",128,1677
1677,1,7,Robin ,"Well, we know that there's no such thing as a cockamouse. What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking.",129,1678
1678,1,7,Marshall ,So you really don't believe in the cockamouse?,130,1679
1679,1,7,Robin ,"Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know, um, like the Loch Ness Monster.",131,1680
1680,1,7,Marshall ,"If by 'like the Loch Ness Monster,' you mean, totally exists and is awesome, then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster.",132,1681
1681,1,7,Marshall ,"It's diet is not unlike our own, grains, cereals and it's awfully fond of cheese...",133,1682
1682,1,7,Ted ,"OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin.",134,1683
1683,1,7,Barney ,You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny.,135,1684
1684,1,7,Ted ,"All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?",136,1685
1685,1,7,Future Ted VO," That's right, I did the math.",137,1686
1686,1,7,Ted ,Hi.,138,1687
1687,1,7,Sarah ,"Hi, I'm Dr. O'Brien.",139,1688
1688,1,7,Ted ,I'm Architect Mosby. Sorry I just wanted to say my job too.,140,1689
1689,1,7,Ted ,"Hi, I'm Ted.",141,1690
1690,1,7,Sarah ,"So, what are we doing today?",142,1691
1691,1,7,Ted ,I have a kind of mole on my back. It's probably nothing but I'm a cautious guy.,143,1692
1692,1,7,Sarah ,I'm exactly the same.,144,1693
1693,1,7,Ted (singing) ,"Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.",145,1694
1694,1,7,Sarah (joining in singing) ,Blowing through the jasmine in my mind.,146,1695
1695,1,7,Ted ,"Sorry about that, Summer Breeze is my guilty pleasure song.",147,1696
1696,1,7,Ted ,"Oh, it's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend at brunch.",148,1697
1697,1,7,Sarah ,I love brunch.,149,1698
1698,1,7,Ted ,"It's the best, as long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies.",150,1699
1699,1,7,Sarah ,"I like the way you think, Architect Mosby.",151,1700
1700,1,7,Ted ,"Hey, this may sound weird but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off so I'm gonna ask you now. Do you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?",152,1701
1701,1,7,Sarah ,"Oh, that's very sweet, but I'm actually getting married on Saturday.",153,1702
1702,1,7,Ted ,Friday night?,154,1703
1703,1,7,Ted ,"Wow, you're getting married. Congratulations.",155,1704
1704,1,7,Sarah ,Thank you.,156,1705
1705,1,7,Ted ,I'm really sorry I asked you out. If just felt like there might be this weird connection between us. How crazy am I coming off here?,157,1706
1706,1,7,Sarah ,Only a little.,158,1707
1707,1,7,Ted ,"Well, by some million to one shot, and I'm not rooting for this, you wind up not getting married this weekend, give me a call.",159,1708
1708,1,7,Sarah ,"OK, but it's not likely. I look damn good in my dress.",160,1709
1709,1,7,Ted ,I'm sure you do.,161,1710
1710,1,7,Robin ,"Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap. You think the road runner's gonna fall for it?",162,1711
1711,1,7,Lily ,"OK, we get it. You're skeptical. But Marshall and I, we're believers. We believe.",163,1712
1712,1,7,Marshall ,"Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome. You got the Bermuda triangle, ghosts, Big Foot.",164,1713
1713,1,7,Robin ,Bad maps. Creaky houses. Hillbilly in a gorilla suit.,165,1714
1714,1,7,Marshall ,Aliens.,166,1715
1715,1,7,Marshall ,"Oh, come one, you gotta give me aliens. Stonehenge. Area 51. There's alien crap all over the place.",167,1716
1716,1,7,Robin ,You can't be serious.,168,1717
1717,1,7,Marshall ,"My friend, you just poked the bear.",169,1718

1720,1,7,Lily ,"Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.",172,1721
1721,1,7,Ted ,"Yeah, it was a long shot. I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mine, but I don't know...",173,1722
1722,1,7,Lily ,"Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.",174,1723
1723,1,7,Barney ,"Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game.",175,1724
1724,1,7,Marshall ,"On the night of July 2nd, 1947, conditions were clear over Roswell, New Mexico.",176,1725
1725,1,7,Robin ,Oh geez.,177,1726
1726,1,7,Marshall ,"Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you. Dr. O'Brien.",178,1727
1727,1,7,Ted ,What?,179,1728
1728,1,7,Marshall ,"When suddenly, an array of",180,1729

1730,1,7,Barney ,The doctor will see you now.,182,1731
1731,1,7,Ted ,"What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?",183,1732
1732,1,7,Lily ,Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday.,184,1733
1733,1,7,Ted ,"Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.",185,1734
1734,1,7,Barney ,(chuckles) Happy ending.,186,1735
1735,1,7,Ted ,"Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a shot.",187,1736
1736,1,7,Barney ,"All right, see you later. Happy hunting.",188,1737
1737,1,7,Lily ,"Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse.",189,1738
1738,1,7,Barney ,"Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles.",190,1739
1739,1,7,Marshall ,Oh my God!,191,1740
1740,1,7,Lily ,Holy crap. We got it! What do we do with it?,192,1741
1741,1,7,Marshall ,"Calm down, I have a plan. I told my friend, Sudeep, about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department. But it has to be alive.",193,1742
1742,1,7,Lily ,"Wait, no no. They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean. Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat?",194,1743
1743,1,7,Ted ,Hello again.,195,1744
1744,1,7,Sarah ,I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person.,196,1745
1745,1,7,Ted ,"Go ahead, Sarah, you can tell me anything.",197,1746
1746,1,7,Sarah ,You have a basal cell carcinoma.,198,1747
1747,1,7,Ted ,Anything else?,199,1748
1748,1,7,Sarah ,"Your mole. The biopsy came back. It's not life-threatening, but we should excise the rest of it.",200,1749
1749,1,7,Ted ,"Wait, then you're still getting married.",201,1750
1750,1,7,Sarah ,Of course I'm still getting married.,202,1751
1751,1,7,Ted ,But we're a 9.6.,203,1752
1752,1,7,Sarah ,Excuse me.,204,1753
1753,1,7,Ted ,"OK, I, I went to Love Solutions and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer that you and I are a 9.6. Your fiance's only an 8.5.",205,1754
1754,1,7,Sarah ,You looked at my file.,206,1755
1755,1,7,Ted ,I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious? The woman who set you up with your fiancé thinks we're a better match.,207,1756
1756,1,7,Sarah ,I am getting married on Saturday.,208,1757
1757,1,7,Ted (singing) ,Summer breeze...,209,1758
1758,1,7,Sarah ,Ted.,210,1759
1759,1,7,Ted ,"Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?",211,1760
1760,1,7,Sarah ,Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you to proposition an engaged woman you don't even know?,212,1761
1761,1,7,Ted ,"See, we're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other.",213,1762
1762,1,7,Sarah ,"Ted, just calm down.",214,1763
1763,1,7,Ted ,Calm down! You're my only match! There was a computer and there were 8 fish in the sea full of lesbians.,215,1764
1764,1,7,Sarah ,"Ted, Ted, do you honestly believe deep down that there is no one else out there for you just because some computer says so.",216,1765
1765,1,7,Ted ,"Didn't used to. There was math, I got confused.",217,1766
1766,1,7,Sarah ,"Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling. When you fall in love with someone, 8.5 equals a perfect 10.",218,1767
1767,1,7,Ted ,You're right.,219,1768
1768,1,7,Sudeep ,"If this thing is what you say it is, it could be huge for my career.",220,1769
1769,1,7,Marshall ,"Brace yourself, dude. This is gonna blow your mind hold.",221,1770
1770,1,7,Sudeep ,"You b*st*rd, I actually got excited about this.",222,1771
1771,1,7,Marshall ,What?,223,1772
1772,1,7,Sudeep ,It's empty.,224,1773

1774,1,7,Lily ,Robin.,226,1775
1775,1,7,Robin ,What?,227,1776
1776,1,7,Robin ,Oh my God. It's real.,228,1777
1777,1,7,Lily ,"Oh, is it? Do something.",229,1778
1778,1,7,Lily ,What the hell was that? You trying to get it drunk?,230,1779
1779,1,7,Robin ,It was the only think I could think of.,231,1780
1780,1,7,Marshall ,Lily thank God.,232,1781
1781,1,7,Marshall ,"Lily, I love you.",233,1782
1782,1,7,Marshall ,"Robin, open the window!",234,1783
1783,1,7,Robin ,It can fly.,235,1784
1784,1,7,,"Lily, Marshall: Wow.",236,1785
1785,1,7,Marshall ,"Be free, mutant beast. I'll miss this private war of ours. I grew to admire your tenacious...Oh my God, it's headed this way.",237,1786
1786,1,7,Ted ,Hi Ellen. I think I want my money back.,238,1787
1787,1,7,Ellen ,"I'm a failure. I'm all washed up. I tried everything, Ted. I widened the search parameters. I tweaked the program. Last night, I stood out on the street for five hours showing your photo to random pedestrians, no takers. Although this tr*nsv*stite hooker said he/she would do you for half price because you kinda look like John Cusack and his/her favorite movie was Say Anything.",239,1788
1788,1,7,Ted ,"Come on, Ellen, I mean, a pint of ice cream isn't that a bit cliché?",240,1789
1789,1,7,Ellen ,It's for the bourbon.,241,1790
1790,1,7,Ted ,This isn't hopeless. You're gonna find someone for me.,242,1791
1791,1,7,Ellen ,"No, I won't. You're gonna die alone.",243,1792
1792,1,7,Ted ,"I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive. You just have to get back out there and keep looking.",244,1793
1793,1,7,Ellen ,"No, you're never gonna find anybody. And every year, you're just getting older and it's getting harder and harder.",245,1794
1794,1,7,Ted ,You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be up on that wall one of these days.,246,1795
1795,1,7,Ellen ,No you won't.,247,1796
1796,1,7,Ted ,Yes I will,248,1797
1797,1,7,Ellen ,"How do you know? Ted: I don't know, but I believe. Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse can find love in this crazy city, then, dammit, so can I.",249,1798
1798,1,7,Ellen ,You're losing me.,250,1799
1799,1,7,Ted ,"Point is, something good is going to happen to me. Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen.",251,1800
1800,1,7,Ellen ,So I should keep looking?,252,1801
1801,1,7,Ted ,Of course you should. And now you're gonna do it for free.,253,1802
1802,1,8,Future Ted," So kids, there are many buildings New York City.",1,1803
1803,1,8,Future Ted," Thousands of apartments. Millions of stories. And even though it's been decades and someone else lives there now, there's one apartment in particular that will always be our apartment. I have so many great memories of that place.",2,1804
1804,1,8,Future Ted VO, Marshall playing video games.,3,1805
1805,1,8,Future Ted VO, Lily painting on the fire escape.,4,1806

1807,1,8,Lily ,"Sorry, Mr. Madsen.",6,1808
1808,1,8,Future Ted VO," And me making the coffee. I had this coffeepot that was probably 50 years old at that time, and it made truly terrible coffee. We called it Shocky",7,1809
1809,1,8,Ted ,Plugging in.,8,1810
1810,1,8,Marshall ,Saving game.,9,1811
1811,1,8,Future Ted VO, I loved every last detail of that place. Right down to the incredibly tacky swords we hung on the wall. I never wanted any of it to change. But that's not how life works.,10,1812
1812,1,8,Lily ,You guys will never believe what just happened to us.,11,1813
1813,1,8,Robin ,I don't even believe it myself.,12,1814
1814,1,8,Lily ,We were in Queens and we decided to stop by my apartment.,13,1815
1815,1,8,Daughter ,"Wait, her apartment? I thought Aunt Lily lived with you and Uncle Marshall.",14,1816
1816,1,8,Lily ,I could see how you would think that but I have to have my own place. It's an independence thing.,15,1817
1817,1,8,Robin ,When was the last time you were there?,16,1818
1818,1,8,Lily ,Three months ago.,17,1819
1819,1,8,Lily ,What? It's like fat pants. You hope you never have to use 'em but you're glad to know they're there.,18,1820
1820,1,8,Lily ,What the hell?,19,1821
1821,1,8,Robin ,What?,20,1822
1822,1,8,Lily ,This is my apartment.,21,1823
1823,1,8,Robin ,Where?,22,1824
1824,1,8,Lily ,Right here.,23,1825

1826,1,8,Robin ,"Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant.",25,1827
1827,1,8,Lily ,"No, no, this was my apartment. My dresser was right...",26,1828
1828,1,8,Lily ,That's my dresser! And this is my closet.,27,1829
1829,1,8,Waitress ,"Hi, how many?",28,1830
1830,1,8,,(Lily looks up at Waitress) Waitress: Lily.,29,1831

1832,1,8,Waitress ,"Yeah, from your homecoming picture. You're much prettier in person.",31,1833
1833,1,8,Lily ,"Yeah, I know, the bangs were a mistake. Where's my stuff? Waitress: It's all in the back. We could wrap it up for you. You want it to go?",32,1834
1834,1,8,Lily ,This is my apartment!,33,1835
1835,1,8,Waitress ,Not anymore.,34,1836
1836,1,8,Ted ,No way. You're making this up.,35,1837
1837,1,8,Marshall ,"Yeah, the building would have had to give you some sort of notice.",36,1838
1838,1,8,Waitress ,They sent you a notice about this.,37,1839
1839,1,8,Lily ,When?,38,1840
1840,1,8,Waitress ,Three months ago. Here's your mail minus the magazines.,39,1841
1841,1,8,Marshall ,"Well, still, legally, they can't just toss you out onto the street. You have a lease.",40,1842
1842,1,8,Lily ,"OK so I didn't have a written lease as such but, but go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy.",41,1843
1843,1,8,Lily ,She may be 98 years old but she's still...,42,1844
1844,1,8,Lily ,"She's dead, isn't she?",43,1845
1845,1,8,Waitress ,Never even saw the bus.,44,1846
1846,1,8,Lily ,My apartment is a Chinese restaurant. What am I gonna do?,45,1847
1847,1,8,Ted ,Come live with us.,46,1848
1848,1,8,Lily ,Really?,47,1849
1849,1,8,Ted ,Of course.,48,1850
1850,1,8,Marshall ,"You sure about this, Ted?",49,1851
1851,1,8,Ted ,"Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything.",50,1852
1852,1,8,Barney ,"No, it's like it'll change everything. Oh, Ted, you are so screwed.",51,1853
1853,1,8,Ted ,What? What are you talking about?,52,1854
1854,1,8,Robin ,And why is that girl checking you out?,53,1855
1855,1,8,Barney ,"Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged",54,1856
1856,1,8,Ted ,"Yeah, so?",55,1857
1857,1,8,Barney ,"So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be?",56,1858
1858,1,8,Robin ,"Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right?",57,1859
1859,1,8,Ted ,"Yeah, we've talked about it.",58,1860
1860,1,8,Marshall ,"So, when Lily and I get married, who's gonna get the apartment?",59,1861
1861,1,8,Ted ,"Oh, that's a tough one. You know who I think could handle a problem like that?",60,1862
1862,1,8,Marshall ,Who?,61,1863
1863,1,8,Ted ,Future Ted and Future Marshall.,62,1864
1864,1,8,Marshall ,Totally. Let's let those guys handle it.,63,1865
1865,1,8,Ted ,Dammit Past Ted,64,1866
1866,1,8,Barney ,"You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out.",65,1867
1867,1,8,Ted ,That's crazy. They're not edging me out. Marshall's my best friend.,66,1868
1868,1,8,Ted ,One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.,67,1869
1869,1,8,Barney ,"Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment.",68,1870
1870,1,8,Robin ,"Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?",69,1871
1871,1,8,Barney ,Sort of on a date with her.,70,1872
1872,1,8,Ted ,What?,71,1873
1873,1,8,Barney ,"I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile. (evil laugh) But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.",72,1874
1874,1,8,Ted ,All right.,73,1875
1875,1,8,Robin ,You're going to the hospital?,74,1876
1876,1,8,Ted ,"No, see, he's gonna go back over there and I'm gonna call him and he's gonna pretend that it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.",75,1877
1877,1,8,Robin ,"Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney.",76,1878
1878,1,8,Barney ,"Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck.",77,1879
1879,1,8,Robin ,"So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?",78,1880
1880,1,8,Ted ,"He's gonna want the apartment. I'm gonna want the apartment. It's gonna lead to an argument, so no.",79,1881
1881,1,8,Robin ,"Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it.",80,1882
1882,1,8,Ted ,I should really make this call.,81,1883
1883,1,8,Robin ,"Ooh, can I do it?",82,1884
1884,1,8,Barney ,"Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy.",83,1885
1885,1,8,Barney ,"Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?",84,1886
1886,1,8,Robin ,"Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff.",85,1887
1887,1,8,Barney ,"An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy.",86,1888
1888,1,8,Barney ,Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?,87,1889
1889,1,8,Robin ,"Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.",88,1890
1890,1,8,Barney ,"Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there.",89,1891
1891,1,8,Barney ,See you guys later.,90,1892
1892,1,8,Ted ,"Ah, this'll be nice, the three of us living together. I think it's a good setup.",91,1893
1893,1,8,Ted ,"Man, this coffee's great. It's really great. Too great.",92,1894
1894,1,8,Ted ,What happened to Shocky?,93,1895
1895,1,8,Ted ,"What's this? Lily: My coffeemaker from my apartment. Makes great coffee, right?",94,1896
1896,1,8,Ted ,"Yeah, definitely. I mean, so does Shocky.",95,1897
1897,1,8,Marshall ,Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kinda rusty.,96,1898
1898,1,8,Ted ,"Yeah, no, it did. I mean, I kinda liked the rusty taste. I'm used to it. I don't know.",97,1899
1899,1,8,Marshall ,"Also Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock you.",98,1900
1900,1,8,Ted ,"No. You gotta admit, that shock, wakes you up in the morning",99,1901
1901,1,8,Marshall ,You know what else wakes you up in the morning? Coffee.,100,1902
1902,1,8,Ted ,That's great. You're right. Roomies! I love it.,101,1903
1903,1,8,Ted ,They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.,102,1904
1904,1,8,Barney ,"Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.",103,1905
1905,1,8,Robin ,"Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she!",104,1906
1906,1,8,Ted ,It's not just the coffeemaker.,105,1907
1907,1,8,Lily ,Done. The painting's done.,106,1908
1908,1,8,Marshall ,That is great.,107,1909
1909,1,8,Ted ,Nice.,108,1910
1910,1,8,Marshall ,Where do you wanna hang it?,109,1911
1911,1,8,Lily ,"I don't know. Um, over the piano?",110,1912
1912,1,8,Ted ,"Yeah, that would be a good place for it. Too bad the swords are there. We kinda love those swords.",111,1913
1913,1,8,Marshall ,"Well, those swords have been up there a long time.",112,1914
1914,1,8,Ted ,"I know, right? I'd really miss them too. So, maybe Marshall's room?",113,1915
1915,1,8,Lily ,OK.,114,1916
1916,1,8,Ted ,He was gonna take the swords down. Can you believe that?,115,1917
1917,1,8,Robin ,"Ted, why don't you just talk to him? He's your best friend.",116,1918
1918,1,8,Robin ,"One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.",117,1919
1919,1,8,Barney ,"Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike.",118,1920
1920,1,8,Ted ,"Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?",119,1921
1921,1,8,Barney ,"You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big.",120,1922
1922,1,8,Ted ,"What, like buy a new sofa?",121,1923
1923,1,8,Barney ,Bigger.,122,1924
1924,1,8,Barney ,"Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law.",123,1925
1925,1,8,Robin ,"A lemon law, like for cars.",124,1926
1926,1,8,Barney ,"Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now.",125,1927
1927,1,8,Barney ,Hi Katie. Barney.,126,1928
1928,1,8,Katie ,"Hi, it's good to finally meet you.",127,1929
1929,1,8,Barney ,"Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.",128,1930
1930,1,8,Barney (yelling to Katie as she leaves) ,Tell your friends.,129,1931
1931,1,8,Barney (to Robin and Ted at other table) ,It's gonna be a thing.,130,1932
1932,1,8,Lily ,"Man, Ted's been acting weird. He started labeling all his food. He even carved ""Ted"" into that block of cheese.",131,1933
1933,1,8,Marshall ,"Yeah. Well, now it's Ed's.",132,1934
1934,1,8,Lily ,He's not cool with me moving in.,133,1935

1999,1,8,Ted ,"It's OK, it's OK.",198,2000
2000,1,8,Ted ,Can I observe something?,199,2001

2023,1,8,Ted ,"OK, but this time, jump up and I'll swipe your legs.",222,2024
2024,1,8,Ted ,"Look. Here's why I should get the place. You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates. And on top of that I could be homeless. Does that seem fair?",223,2025
2025,1,8,Marshall ,"Oh, boo-freakin-hoo.",224,2026
2026,1,8,Ted ,What?,225,2027
2027,1,8,Marshall ,"Woe is me. I'm not married yet. My ovaries are shrinking. Ted, if you wanted to be married by now you would be but you're not. And you know why? Because you're irrationally picky. You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.",226,2028
2028,1,8,Ted ,Anhedonic?,227,2029
2029,1,8,Marshall ,Anhedonic. It means you can't enjoy anything.,228,2030

2031,1,8,Marshall ,"I know, this rules.",230,2032
2032,1,8,Marshall ,"Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down.",231,2033
2033,1,8,Ted ,"That's OK, it led to this totally rad sword fight, didn't it?",232,2034
2034,1,8,Marshall ,Yeah it did.,233,2035
2035,1,8,Marshall ,You remember when we first got these swords?,234,2036

2045,1,8,Marshall ,I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fiancé.,244,2046
2046,1,8,Ted ,"Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fiancé? I'm kidding. Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment. Marshall: But you fought so bravely for it.",245,2047
2047,1,8,Ted ,"I wasn't fighting for the apartment. I was fighting for...I don't know...for everything to stay the way it is. But I'm not gonna get that, so, seriously, take the place, it's yours.",246,2048
2048,1,8,Robin ,Is she OK?,247,2049
2049,1,8,Marshall ,They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine.,248,2050

2062,1,8,Marshall ,"Well, just to be fair, it didn't go all the way through.",261,2063
2063,1,8,Lily ,"I'm sorry, is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me?",262,2064
2064,1,8,Marshall ,You're right. I'm sorry. We were fighting to see who gets the apartment. And I won.,263,2065

2066,1,8,Marshall ,"Uh, you know, if I tried...",265,2067
2067,1,8,Lily ,"Wait wait wait wait wait. I don't want that apartment. It's a boy apartment. It's full of swords and videogames, and kinda smells like dude. It's fine for now, but when we get married, I wanna start a new life with you in a new place.",266,2068
2068,1,8,Marshall ,Gonna miss the old place.,267,2069

2202,1,9,Lily ,(staring at turkey) Oh my.,117,2203

2245,1,9,Lily ,"Oh, so is New York.",160,2246

2255,1,9,Lily ,"Yeah, to Brooklyn.",170,2256
2256,1,9,Marshall ,Why are we even talking about this? This is way down the road.,171,2257

2287,1,9,Clerk ,Happy Thanksgiving.,202,2288
2288,1,9,Lily ,"Happy Thanksgiving. As in check out the chick buying the knock-up test everybody, wonder what must be going through her head. Yeah, well, since you asked, a family of mayonnaise-guzzling giants is trying to suck me into their suburban nightmare. And there's a solid chance that I have an Ericksen the size of a 15-pound turkey growing inside of me.",203,2289
2289,1,9,Clerk ,You know the Ericksen's? Marshall's fiancé.,204,2290
2290,1,9,Lily ,Fantastic.,205,2291
2291,1,9,Clerk ,So nice to meet you. You are taller than described.,206,2292

2293,1,9,Clerk ,Don't have one.,208,2294
2294,1,9,Lily ,So what do you do when you have to...?,209,2295
2295,1,9,Clerk ,I hold it.,210,2296
2296,1,9,Ted ,You can't fire a volunteer.,211,2297
2297,1,9,Robin ,Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.,212,2298
2298,1,9,Barney ,I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip.,213,2299
2299,1,9,Barney ,Volunteer of the year!,214,2300

2308,1,9,Pete ,No problemo Marsh.,223,2309
2309,1,9,Marshall ,You all right? Lily: No. I embarrassed myself in front of your family and now I'm celebrating Thanksgiving in probably the most depressing place ever.,224,2310
2310,1,9,Marshall ,"Well, I'm glad that you're safe. Hey, weird question, why did you drive three miles down Route 23 and take a pee behind a convenience store?",225,2311
2311,1,9,Lily ,"OK, I'll tell you but before I do, promise me that we are not gonna move to St. Cloud, Minnesota, promise.",226,2312
2312,1,9,Marshall ,"Look, I'm not suggesting that we move here tomorrow. I'm just...",227,2313
2313,1,9,Lily ,Just promise.,228,2314
2314,1,9,Marshall ,Why do you want me to promise you that?,229,2315
2315,1,9,Lily ,Because I don't fit in here. I'm not eight feet tall and I don't think you can call it a salad if it has Funyuns in it.,230,2316
2316,1,9,Marshall ,"I'm Funyuns and mayonnaise and gummy bears and baskiceball and I love St. Cloud. And yes, there is a part of me that would like to move here someday, and why are we having this discussion in a jail cell on Thanksgiving?",231,2317
2317,1,9,Pete ,"OK, personal effects, one wallet, one cell phone, one pregnancy test.",232,2318
2318,1,9,Lily ,Pete arrested me before I could look at it.,233,2319
2319,1,9,Marshall ,Whoa.,234,2320
2320,1,9,Lily ,Yeah.,235,2321
2321,1,9,Marshall ,"Lily, we can't let our kids play baskiceball. Baskiceball is really dangerous.",236,2322
2322,1,9,Lily ,"Yeah, what are the rules to that game, anyway? Marshall: There are no rules, we just wail on each other.",237,2323
2323,1,9,Marshall ,"Look, I don't wanna be exactly like my family, and don't take this the wrong way, but I don't wanna be exactly like your family either.",238,2324
2324,1,9,,"(Lily shakes her head) Marshall: We'll be our own family, and we'll find our own way to freak out the people our kids bring home.",239,2325
2325,1,9,Lily ,"Great, now I'm crying. Look, we may have some really big decisions to make in about 10 seconds but right now, I don't care where our kids grow up as long as they have you for a father.",240,2326
2326,1,9,Lily ,"Gosh, I hope you're the father. Just a little joke to lighten up the mood.",241,2327
2327,1,9,Marshall ,What does it say? Lily: I'm afraid to look.,242,2328
2328,1,9,Pete ,(yelling from outside cell) It's negative.,243,2329
2329,1,9,Lily ,Thank God.,244,2330
2330,1,9,Lily ,(to Pete) And hey!,245,2331
2331,1,9,Robin ,Ted. Are you listening? You're a good guy.,246,2332
2332,1,9,Ted ,"You wanna know why I have to work tomorrow? My firm's designing an executive lounge for a tobacco company. In the fight against cancer, I'm on the side of cancer.",247,2333
2333,1,9,Barney ,"OK, Ted, I found a way for you to help someone, to do some good. This is Walter, and Walter is homeless. And Walter would like a lap dance.",248,2334
2334,1,9,Ted ,Are you joking?,249,2335
2335,1,9,Barney ,I never joke about the sublime art of burlesque entertainment.,250,2336
2336,1,9,Ted ,"No, Barney, that's insane. Sir, would you like me to buy you a ticket to the buffet.",251,2337
2337,1,9,Walter ,"No, I'm stuffed. Just a lap dance would be fine.",252,2338
2338,1,9,Barney ,"Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners. You know where he hasn't been? To heaven with Samantha. Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need. Now buy this man a lap dance.",253,2339
2339,1,9,Robin ,You said you wanted to see the joy in someone's eyes.,254,2340
2340,1,9,Ted ,"You know, I don't think I'm gonna watch.",255,2341

2344,1,9,Robin ,Thanksgiving in November. Weird.,259,2345
2345,1,9,Future Ted VO," So that was Thanksgiving 2005. To be honest, it didn't go great. But like has plenty of good parts. It's the rough parts that make you thankful that you have people to share it with.",260,2346
2346,1,9,Dancer ,"Hey, I saw what you did for that guy? It was really sweet. Do you wanna dance?",261,2347
2347,1,9,Ted ,"Uh, no thanks. You want some yams?",262,2348
2348,1,9,Dancer ,No thanks. I'm Amber.,263,2349

2353,1,9,,"Daughter, Son: What?!",268,2354
2354,1,9,Future Ted, I'm kidding.,269,2355

2359,1,10,Everyone ,"Wow. Thanks, Carl.",5,2360
2360,1,10,Ted ,"We're not really doing shots, are we?",6,2361
2361,1,10,Lily ,I hope not.,7,2362
2362,1,10,Barney ,"No, no.",8,2363
2363,1,10,Lily ,These look kinda like blood.,9,2364
2364,1,10,Marshall ,"OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?",10,2365
2365,1,10,Barney ,That's ridiculous.,11,2366
2366,1,10,Marshall ,"I'm serious. Think about it. He always wears black, we never see him in the daylight, only after dark.",12,2367
2367,1,10,Robin ,"Oh my God, that does describe a vampire, or you know, a bartender.",13,2368
2368,1,10,Robin ,"Well, I should go get dressed.",14,2369
2369,1,10,Ted ,"Where are you going, buddy? Hot date?",15,2370

2372,1,10,Ted ,"Wait, you're really going out with a billionaire?",18,2373
2373,1,10,Robin ,He's not a billionaire. He's a hundred millionaire. Why do people always round up?,19,2374
2374,1,10,Ted ,"So, uh, where's Thurston Howell taking you?",20,2375
2375,1,10,Robin ,A charity dinner.,21,2376

2388,1,10,Barney ,What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go.,34,2389

2406,1,10,Marshall ,Interesting,52,2407
2407,1,10,Barney ,"Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style.",53,2408
2408,1,10,Ted ,"So, what? You want me to do a shot.",54,2409

2448,1,10,Marshall ,"Oh, bad idea.",94,2449
2449,1,10,Barney ,"No, no, that's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk. You do things you would never do in a million years if you were sober.",95,2450

2603,1,10,,"(Ted gets his phone out) Trudy: Here, let me.",249,2604
2604,1,10,Ted ,Why do they call it karaoke anyhow? Was it invented by a woman named Carrie Okie? These are the kinds of things I think about. Trudy: Karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra.,250,2605
2605,1,10,Ted ,That's hauntingly beautiful.,251,2606
2606,1,10,Ted ,"Hey, it works.",252,2607
2607,1,10,Trudy ,Then I guess you're gonna have to call me.,253,2608

2611,1,10,Trudy ,Hey.,257,2612
2612,1,10,Ted ,"Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life.",258,2613
2613,1,10,Trudy ,"So I came over here. And now I'm really, really embarrassed.",259,2614
2614,1,10,Marshall ,"Dammit, Trudy, what about the pineapple? Sorry.",260,2615
2615,1,10,Ted ,"Uh, Robin's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom.",261,2616
2616,1,10,Trudy ,"Why, is that your girlfriend?",262,2617

2625,1,10,Ted ,"Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was very drunk.",271,2626
2626,1,10,Robin ,"No kidding. Those calls were really weird. Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk.",272,2627
2627,1,10,Lily ,Let's go get a snack.,273,2628
2628,1,10,Marshall ,I love to snack.,274,2629
2629,1,10,Barney ,I'm good.,275,2630
2630,1,10,Ted ,"Come on, those calls weren't that weird.",276,2631
2631,1,10,Ted ,"(recording form phone) Robin! Come hang out! OK, I'm gonna make this sound until you come hang out.",277,2632
2632,1,10,Robin ,That goes on for three-and a half minutes.,278,2633
2633,1,10,Ted ,Without a breath? That's gotta be some kind of record.,279,2634
2634,1,10,Robin ,"Ted, you can't do this. Please, we're to be friends and now you're making it all confusing.",280,2635
2635,1,10,Ted ,"No I'm not. Look, I just turned off my brain for the night. Nothing's changed, you've moved on, I've moved on.",281,2636
2636,1,10,Robin ,"Really, you moved on?",282,2637
2637,1,10,Ted ,"Yes. What, you don't believe me?",283,2638
2638,1,10,Ted ,"Oh, OK.",284,2639
2639,1,10,Ted ,"Trudy, come on out.",285,2640

2642,1,10,Ted ,"Trudy, come on out.",288,2643
2643,1,10,Ted ,"Seriously, it's OK. This is so Trudy. She's really shy, I think.",289,2644
2644,1,10,Ted ,Trudy?,290,2645
2645,1,10,Robin ,"Hi Trudy, I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you. You're right, she is shy.",291,2646
2646,1,10,Ted ,I'm not making this up. She must have climbed out the fire escape.,292,2647
2647,1,10,Ted ,"Whatever, whatever. I don't care what you think.",293,2648
2648,1,10,Robin ,"Then why did you hide her from me? Ted: Wow, you're good. Did anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 Minutes?",294,2649
2649,1,10,Robin ,"Yes, you did, last night.",295,2650
2650,1,10,Ted ,Really? Well.,296,2651
2651,1,10,Robin ,"Get some sleep, Ted. You had a long night. And don't feel bad, I've woken up with worse.",297,2652
2652,1,10,Future Ted VO," I left Trudy a message but she never called me back. That's just how life works sometimes. You turn off your brain for a night, and all you're left with is a bad hangover, a sprained ankle.",298,2653
2653,1,10,Future Ted VO," Oh, and we never found out where that pineapple came from, but it was delicious.",299,2654
2654,1,11,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks. Sure, it looks great on TV, but in reality, it's always just a big let down, but in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible, to give my friends a great New Year's Eve. I had an idea of how to do it, too. And all it cost was half my Christmas bonus.",1,2655
2655,1,11,Ted ,"Yeah, that's right...a limo.",2,2656
2656,1,11,Robin ,"Oh, man, Ted, this is great.",3,2657
2657,1,11,Ted ,"Okay, people, let's talk strategy. Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked. This year we party together or not at all. Now, I sifted through your party submission and I narrowed them down to these five.",4,2658
2658,1,11,Barney ,Question?,5,2659
2659,1,11,Ted ,"Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.",6,2660
2660,1,11,Barney ,"But you enjoyed the e-vite, right? Thas an actual picture of my pants.",7,2661
2661,1,11,Lily ,Yeah.,8,2662
2662,1,11,Ted ,"We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City and that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year.",9,2663
2663,1,11,Lily ,"All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?",10,2664
2664,1,11,Robin ,Mary Beth?,11,2665
2665,1,11,Ted ,"Oh, she works in my office. She seems like she might be into me. She's always finding reasons to hug me. So tonight...",12,2666
2666,1,11,Barney ,"People often ask me ""Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?""",13,2667
2667,1,11,Lily ,By who? Who asks you that?,14,2668
2668,1,11,Barney ,"And the answer is right here... my own, personal ""get psyched"" mix. Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong. It should be all rise, baby. Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline. Bam.",15,2669
2669,1,11,Lily ,It's working.,16,2670
2670,1,11,Ted ,I am definitely getting psyched.,17,2671
2671,1,11,Marshall ,"Oh, God. I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage. Must do robot.",18,2672
2672,1,11,Barney ,Let's do this!,19,2673
2673,1,11,Ted ,"Yes! Let's! Oh, driver?",20,2674
2674,1,11,Barney ,"Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now. That's awesome.",21,2675
2675,1,11,Ranjit ,I've moved up in the world.,22,2676
2676,1,11,Robin ,How do you guys know each other?,23,2677
2677,1,11,Ted ,"Oh, we rode in his cab one time. It's a long story.",24,2678
2678,1,11,Barney ,"Hey, what are we waiting for? We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.",25,2679
2679,1,11,Robin ,"Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up.",26,2680
2680,1,11,,"Ted from 2030: Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend, Derek. Derek. He was like rich, successful, handsome. I hated that guy.",27,2681

2682,1,11,Lily ,Bye.,29,2683
2683,1,11,Ted ,See ya next year. Go get 'em.,30,2684
2684,1,11,Lily ,"Well, this kind of sucks.",31,2685
2685,1,11,Ted ,"Okay, nobody get down. We knew this going in. We're a man down. That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder. Ranjit! Party number one.",32,2686
2686,1,11,Ranjit ,Party number one!,33,2687
2687,1,11,Barney ,Party number one!,34,2688
2688,1,11,Marshall ,"I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets. If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.",35,2689
2689,1,11,Ted ,"Hey, we've got four more parties to hit. If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.",36,2690
2690,1,11,Lily ,"We didn't really get a chance to meet. I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall.",37,2691
2691,1,11,Mary Beth, Hi. Mary Beth. So great to meet you guys.,38,2692

2701,1,11,Natalya ,"Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?",48,2702
2702,1,11,Barney ,Isn't she awesome?,49,2703
2703,1,11,Marshall ,"How are your feet doing, baby?",50,2704
2704,1,11,Lily ,"Okay, I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep. Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?",51,2705
2705,1,11,Ted ,"Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us. I need you to power through the pain.",52,2706
2706,1,11,Lily ,"Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.",53,2707

2840,1,11,Robin ,"Is this just 'cause you lost your ""Get Psyched"" mix?",187,2841
2841,1,11,Barney ,I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?,188,2842
2842,1,11,Robin ,"No. No, not tonight. Not in the limo. We got to stay psyched. Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's. (singing...) *Shot through the heart And you're to blame, darling*",189,2843

Will you be bringing a guest or will you be attending alone? What it's really asking is where do you see yourself in three months? Sitting next to your girlfriend or hitting on a bridesmaid? I always checked that I was bringing a guest. I was an optimist.",1,2921

2922,1,12,Barney ,"Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah.",3,2923

2933,1,12,Robin ,"Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed.",14,2934
2934,1,12,Barney ,"Don't beat yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you.",15,2935
2935,1,12,Robin ,"Thanks, I feel a lot better. Think I'll get that drink now.",16,2936

2947,1,12,Barney ,What?,28,2948

3003,1,12,Ted ,I did.,84,3004
3004,1,12,Barney ,"Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date.

3021,1,12,Robin ,"Well, did I bring it? Or did I bring it?",102,3022
3022,1,12,Robin ,I think I brought it.,103,3023
3023,1,12,Ted ,Wow.,104,3024
3024,1,12,Robin ,That's what I was going for. I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're gonna have so much fun.,105,3025
3025,1,12,Ted ,"Yeah, about that.",106,3026
3026,1,12,,(Robin looks at Ted) Ted: I'll pick you up at five.,107,3027
3027,1,12,Lily ,"So, the dress?",108,3028
3028,1,12,Ted ,I don't have a 'plus one' for the wedding.,109,3029
3029,1,12,Lily ,What?,110,3030
3030,1,12,Ted ,I ran into Claudia and she told me I didn't check 'plus one' on the reply card.,111,3031
3031,1,12,Lily ,Why didn't you check 'plus...,112,3032
3032,1,12,Ted ,I did check 'plus one'.,113,3033
3033,1,12,Lily ,But Robin is so excited.,114,3034
3034,1,12,Ted ,I know.,115,3035
3035,1,12,Lily ,And the dress.,116,3036
3036,1,12,Ted ,I know.,117,3037
3037,1,12,Lily ,"Oh. OK, OK, we'll, we'll sneak her in.",118,3038
3038,1,12,Ted ,"We can't sneak her in, we're not ninjas.",119,3039
3039,1,12,Lily ,I wish we were ninjas.,120,3040
3040,1,12,Ted ,I know.,121,3041
3041,1,12,Lily ,You can always ask Stuart.,122,3042
3042,1,12,Ted ,Can I do that?,123,3043
3043,1,12,Lily ,"Sure, you guys have been friends for a long time, and it's 40% his wedding too.",124,3044
3044,1,12,Ted ,"Oh, it's gonna be a tough sell.",125,3045
3045,1,12,Stuart ,"Dude, no problem whatsoever.",126,3046
3046,1,12,Ted ,"Really? Stuart: Sure, the more the merrier.",127,3047
3047,1,12,Ted ,"Wow, wow, thanks for being so cool about this 'cause you know Claudia said...",128,3048
3048,1,12,Stuart ,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, this morning at the rehearsal, Claudia called our 7-year-old flower girl a whore. So, don't take it personally, she's just a little stressed.",129,3049
3049,1,12,Ted ,"Yeah, she's not usually like that.",130,3050
3050,1,12,Stuart ,No.,131,3051
3051,1,12,Ted ,"Well, thanks, Stu, it's gonna be a great wedding.",132,3052
3052,1,12,Lily ,"Honey, this magazine says more and more couples are opting to have nontraditional weddings out in the woods.",133,3053
3053,1,12,Marshall ,"Well, if a magazine says so, we should go get married in the woods like a couple of squirrels.",134,3054
3054,1,12,Lily ,"Squirrels don't get married, Marshall.",135,3055
3055,1,12,Marshall ,Like you could possibly know that.,136,3056
3056,1,12,Ted ,I did it. I did it. I'm taking her to the wedding.,137,3057
3057,1,12,Lily ,Nice.,138,3058
3058,1,12,Marshall ,What? How?,139,3059
3059,1,12,Ted ,I talked to Stuart.,140,3060
3060,1,12,Marshall ,"Oh, you went around the bride. ""Oh, this hornet's nest looks harmless. Maybe I'll poke it with a stick. Oh, look, some gremlins, let me go feed them after midnight."" Did you known about this?",141,3061
3061,1,12,Lily ,It may have been my idea.,142,3062
3062,1,12,Lily ,What? Stuart doesn't get a say.,143,3063
3063,1,12,Marshall ,"Ha! So you admit it, the groom should have an equal say.",144,3064
3064,1,12,Lily ,"Oh, yeah, sure, on the stupid stuff, like who comes.",145,3065
3065,1,12,Marshall ,So I can invite whoever I want.,146,3066
3066,1,12,Lily ,"Sure, there's plenty of room in the woods.",147,3067
3067,1,12,Ted ,It's Claudia.,148,3068
3068,1,12,Marshall ,"So, it begins.",149,3069
3069,1,12,Ted ,"Come on, it can't be that bad.",150,3070
3070,1,12,Ted ,"Here, Lily, you answer it.",151,3071
3071,1,12,Lily ,What? Why?,152,3072
3072,1,12,Ted ,Because this whole thing was your idea. And Claudia scares me.,153,3073
3073,1,12,Lily ,But...but you're the guy...oh.,154,3074
3074,1,12,Lily ,"Ted's phone. Oh, hi Claudia. What?",155,3075
3075,1,12,Future Ted VO," Now I wasn't there, but what I heard, it went something like this.",156,3076
3076,1,12,Stuart ,"Uh, by the way, honey, Ted stopped by and I told him he could bring his date to the wedding.",157,3077
3077,1,12,Claudia ,You what?,158,3078
3078,1,12,Stuart ,I told him he could bring a date to the wedding.,159,3079
3079,1,12,Claudia ,Always undermining me at every turn.,160,3080
3080,1,12,Stuart ,"Try to show a little flexibility, but no, it's all about you.",161,3081
3081,1,12,Claudia ,"And your mother, calling me all the time...",162,3082
3082,1,12,Stuart ,"You know what, the wedding's off.",163,3083
3083,1,12,Lily ,They broke up.,164,3084
3084,1,12,Ted ,Ow!,165,3085
3085,1,12,Lily ,"(to Claudia on phone) Uh-huh, uh-huh.",166,3086
3086,1,12,Ted ,"It's not because of me, is it?",167,3087
3087,1,12,Lily ,Uh-huh.,168,3088
3088,1,12,Claudia ,"My dad already paid for this huge wedding. He's gonna k*ll me. He's gonna k*ll Ted, then I'm gonna k*ll Ted.",169,3089
3089,1,12,Ted ,It's Robin.,170,3090
3090,1,12,Lily ,Answer it.,171,3091
3091,1,12,Ted ,"Uh, Lily's phone.",172,3092
3092,1,12,Robin ,Ted. Where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought.,173,3093
3093,1,12,Ted ,"Uh, Lily's busy.",174,3094
3094,1,12,Robin ,"Oh, OK, well I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's gonna love them.",175,3095
3095,1,12,Ted ,"That's great. I'll tell Lily to tell me. Uh, listen, I really wanna keep talking but now's not a good time so, um, I'm really excited about tomorrow. OK, bye.",176,3096
3096,1,12,Robin ,Bye-bye.,177,3097
3097,1,12,Ted ,"Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this. Do you think she's into me?",178,3098
3098,1,12,Marshall ,"Ted, focus.",179,3099
3099,1,12,Lily ,"Sweetie, just calm down. Do you wanna go somewhere and talk?",180,3100
3100,1,12,Claudia ,I wanna go somewhere and drink.,181,3101
3101,1,12,Lily ,"OK, meet me at MacLaren's. I'll see you there.",182,3102
3102,1,12,Ted ,I feel terrible.,183,3103
3103,1,12,Marshall ,"Well, feel terrible later. Right now, we gotta fix this. Lily, you go down to the bar and comfort Claudia. Ted and I will go and try to talk some sense into Stuart.",184,3104
3104,1,12,Ted ,Tell Claudia I'm sorry. Did she seem pissed at me?,185,3105
3105,1,12,Lily ,"She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000.",186,3106
3106,1,12,Ted ,Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.,187,3107
3107,1,12,Barney ,"Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up.",188,3108
3108,1,12,Barney ,"Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just... (to bartender) two vodka cranberries.",189,3109
3109,1,12,Claudia ,You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.,190,3110
3110,1,12,Barney ,"Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?",191,3111
3111,1,12,Barney ,(to bartender) They all drink vodka cranberries.,192,3112
3112,1,12,Barney ,"So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?",193,3113
3113,1,12,Claudia ,"You got $400,000?",194,3114
3114,1,12,Barney ,"No, but I do have a hug.",195,3115
3115,1,12,Barney ,"(looking up, whispers) Thank you.",196,3116
3116,1,12,Ted ,"Stuart, I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...",197,3117
3117,1,12,Stuart ,"Ted, for all I know you did me the biggest favor anyone's every done me.",198,3118
3118,1,12,Marshall ,"Oh, come on, man, you don't mean that.",199,3119
3119,1,12,Stuart ,"Yeah, I do. This whole thing's made me realize, I miss being single. I miss staying out late and making messes and not cleaning them up. I miss owning p*rn.",200,3120
3120,1,12,Marshall ,"Dude, who doesn't.",201,3121
3121,1,12,Stuart ,"You know, I'll see some super-hot model chick and I'll think, ""why am I with Claudia? I can be with her.""",202,3122
3122,1,12,Ted ,"That's crazy. I mean, you're the luckiest...you and Claudia both...",203,3123
3123,1,12,Stuart ,"The point is, I wanna get married, I wanna settle down. But right now, that's just not who I am. I'm not a commitment guy, I'm a single guy.",204,3124
3124,1,12,Ted ,"Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other. Everybody feels this way sometimes.",205,3125
3125,1,12,Stuart ,"How would you know, you're not even married?",206,3126
3126,1,12,Ted ,"OK, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily. He's the pro. This guy knows relationships. Tell him, Marshall.",207,3127
3127,1,12,Marshall ,"Stuart, don't get married.",208,3128
3128,1,12,Ted ,Dude.,209,3129
3129,1,12,Stuart ,What?,210,3130
3130,1,12,Marshall ,"I'm sorry. Being in a couple is hard and committing, making sacrifices, it's hard. But if it's the right person, then it's easy. Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life, that should be the easiest thing in the world. And if it's not like that, then she's not the one. I'm sorry.",211,3131
3131,1,12,Ted ,"You know I don't have $400,000, right?",212,3132
3132,1,12,,"(Barney and Claudia sit next to each other in booth) Claudia: Maybe we got together too young. Maybe that's what the problem was. I mean, I'm 28 years old. I've really only been with one man.",213,3133
3133,1,12,Barney ,"That's just, that's... (yelling over to bartender) two more vodka cranberries please.",214,3134
3134,1,12,Barney ,"Claudia, it's all gonna be OK.",215,3135
3135,1,12,Claudia ,"Thanks for listening, Barney. Really means a lot to me.",216,3136
3136,1,12,Barney ,"Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.",217,3137
3137,1,12,Lily ,"Oh, hell no.",218,3138
3138,1,12,Barney ,Oww,219,3139
3139,1,12,Lily ,"Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes.",220,3140
3140,1,12,Barney ,"Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each.",221,3141
3141,1,12,Barney ,"All right, all right.",222,3142
3142,1,12,Stuart ,Claudia.,223,3143
3143,1,12,Claudia ,Stuart. I'm so sorry.,224,3144
3144,1,12,Stuart ,I'm so sorry too.,225,3145
3145,1,12,Claudia ,I love you.,226,3146
3146,1,12,Stuart ,"I love you too, babe. Marshall and Ted set me straight, and when Marshall told me not to marry you, it made me realize...",227,3147
3147,1,12,Claudia ,Marshall said what?,228,3148
3148,1,12,Stuart ,He made me realize how much I love you. These guys got us back together.,229,3149
3149,1,12,Ted ,"So, where did we land on the whole 'plus one' thing?",230,3150
3150,1,12,,"(Claudia turns around and tries to attack Ted, Ted runs away) Future Ted VO: It took three more vodka cranberries to subdue Claudia but eventually she graciously agreed to let me bring Robin.",231,3151
3151,1,12,Ted ,Still wow.,232,3152
3152,1,12,Robin ,Wow yourself. Look who else brought it.,233,3153
3153,1,12,Ted ,"Oh yeah, I thought about leaving it at home, but I figured I don't wanna get there and realize I need it and have to go all the way back to get it, so, yeah, I brought it.",234,3154
3154,1,12,Robin ,Sorry.,235,3155
3155,1,12,Robin ,"Hello. Oh my God, tonight? You're kidding. Robin: (to Ted) They want me to anchor the news tonight.",236,3156
3156,1,12,Robin ,"Really? Like, anchor anchor? What happened to Sandy? OK, OK, sure, what time do you need me to...Right now! Oh.",237,3157
3157,1,12,Ted ,Do it. Do it.,238,3158
3158,1,12,Robin ,"OK, I need like five minutes to change and um, I'll call you from the cab...",239,3159
3159,1,12,Marshall ,"So, admit it, this wedding is both indoors and amazing.",240,3160
3160,1,12,Lily ,I'll give you the crab puffs. The crab puffs are good.,241,3161
3161,1,12,Marshall ,Crab puffs were incredible.,242,3162
3162,1,12,Lily ,We should totally have them at our wedding.,243,3163
3163,1,12,Marshall ,"Definitely. Hey, we just agreed on something.",244,3164
3164,1,12,Lily ,Did we just start planning our wedding?,245,3165
3165,1,12,Marshall ,I think we did.,246,3166
3166,1,12,Lily ,We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce.,247,3167
3167,1,12,Marshall ,"Oh, I thought the red sauce was like aweome.",248,3168
3168,1,12,Lily ,"My God, were you born without taste buds? (Marshall smiles and laughs)",249,3169
3169,1,12,Lily ,What?,250,3170
3170,1,12,Marshall ,I love you.,251,3171
3171,1,12,Robin ,"Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break.",252,3172
3172,1,12,Barney ,"Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen.",253,3173
3173,1,12,Ted ,What's a sixteen?,254,3174
3174,1,12,Barney ,Those two eight's right over there. Yeah.,255,3175
3175,1,12,Claudia ,Hi Ted.,256,3176
3176,1,12,Ted ,Claudia.,257,3177
3177,1,12,Claudia ,We just wanted to get a picture with the woman who almost ended our relationship.,258,3178
3178,1,12,Stuart ,"Yeah, where is she?",259,3179
3179,1,12,Ted ,Um (clears throat) She couldn't make it.,260,3180
3180,1,12,Ted ,"What's so funny? Claudia: Plan a wedding, you'll see.",261,3181
3181,1,12,Ted ,"Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.",262,3182
3182,1,12,Barney ,"Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids.",263,3183
3183,1,12,Claudia ,"By the way, I almost forgot. We found this.",264,3184
3184,1,12,Ted ,I didn't check 'plus one'. You were right. Barney: Of course I was right.,265,3185
3185,1,12,Ted ,I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single.,266,3186
3186,1,12,Barney ,Being single's the best.,267,3187
3187,1,12,Ted ,Stay out as late as you want.,268,3188
3188,1,12,Barney ,Answer to no one.,269,3189
3189,1,12,Ted ,The whole world full of endless possibilities.,270,3190
3190,1,12,Barney ,Never having to go to a farmer's market.,271,3191
3191,1,12,Barney ,"OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me...",272,3192
3192,1,12,Future Ted VO," So there we were, two single guys doing our usual single guy thing. For whatever reason, I had let myself believe that this night would be a turning point, that this was the night that my life, my real life, would finally begin. Funny thing is, I wasn't totally wrong.",273,3193
3193,1,12,Future Ted VO, 'Cause that night was just beginning.,274,3194
3194,1,13,Future Ted VO," Kids, in life there are a lot of big romantic moments, and they make life worth living. But here's the problem, moments pass, and lurking just around the corner from those moments is a cruel, unshaven b*st*rd named reality.",1,3195
3195,1,13,Future Ted VO," And so, back in 2006, on the night of Claudia and Stuart's wedding, reality was the enemy.",2,3196
3196,1,13,Tanya ,"Wow, the Peace Corps?",3,3197
3197,1,13,Barney ,"Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, ""Is it?"" And usually they say, ""yes it is.""",4,3198
3198,1,13,Tanya ,"Barney, they are so right. I wish there was something I could do.",5,3199
3199,1,13,Barney ,"Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that.",6,3200
3200,1,13,Future Ted VO, This wasn't how I thought the night would turn out.,7,3201
3201,1,13,Future Ted VO, This was finally supposed to be my big moment with Robin. But then reality came along.,8,3202
3202,1,13,Future Ted VO, Robin got called up last minute to anchor the 11 o'clock news. It was her big break.,9,3203
3203,1,13,Future Ted VO," And I went to the wedding stag. Then, when I least expected it...",10,3204
3204,1,13,Lily ,"Hey, where the hell did you disappear to last night?",11,3205
3205,1,13,Ted ,I had the most amazing night ever.,12,3206
3206,1,13,Marshall ,"Tell me about it, that cake, best cake I ever had. Seriously. My stomach was like, hey bro, I don't know what you're eating 'cause I don't have any eyes but it's basically awesome so keep sending it down gullet alley.",13,3207
3207,1,13,Lily ,"Yeah, I know. My stomach was like, girlfriend, we don't always get along but that cake...",14,3208
3208,1,13,Marshall ,Say what?,15,3209
3209,1,13,Ted ,Lily.,16,3210
3210,1,13,Lily ,"Oh right. Most amazing night ever, and go.",17,3211
3211,1,13,Victoria ,"I should tell you, I have a rule. I never hook up at weddings.",18,3212
3212,1,13,Ted ,I'm guessing you haven't always had this rule.,19,3213
3213,1,13,Victoria ,"Well, here's the thing. Those big romantic moments, they're great when they happen, but they're not real.",20,3214
3214,1,13,Ted ,"Exactly. Exactly, like, like just now, when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there, I'm not gonna lie to you, big time thunderbolt.",21,3215
3215,1,13,Victoria ,You should see me tap-dance. You'd be down on bended knee.,22,3216
3216,1,13,Ted ,Sadly not out of character. But I know now it's just a mirage.,23,3217
3217,1,13,Victoria ,Wedding goggles.,24,3218
3218,1,13,Ted ,"Exactly. And that, in a nutshell, is why I'm not putting the moves on you.",25,3219
3219,1,13,Victoria ,This isn't the moves?,26,3220
3220,1,13,Ted ,"What, you think this is the moves? Believe me, you'd know the moves. People ten tables away would know the moves.",27,3221
3221,1,13,Victoria ,That's too bad.,28,3222
3222,1,13,Ted ,Tell me about it.,29,3223
3223,1,13,Victoria ,"You know, I think I have a solution.",30,3224
3224,1,13,Ted ,Interested.,31,3225
3225,1,13,Victoria ,"And, to preface this, we're not going to sleep together tonight.",32,3226
3226,1,13,Ted ,Less interested.,33,3227
3227,1,13,Ted ,Go ahead.,34,3228
3228,1,13,Victoria ,"OK. So the thing that always screws it up is the next day, right? So, why don't we just cut that part out.",35,3229
3229,1,13,Ted ,What are you saying?,36,3230
3230,1,13,Victoria ,"I'm saying, I'm here, you're here, and this is a big, romantic wedding. Why don't we just dance and have a great time and then when it's over, never see each other again.",37,3231
3231,1,13,Ted ,Unless...,38,3232
3232,1,13,Victoria ,"No, no unless. No emails, no phone numbers, not even names. Tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished. And then, when we're old and gray, we'll look back on this night and it'll be perfect.",39,3233
3233,1,13,Ted ,"Wow. OK, I'm in.",40,3234
3234,1,13,Victoria ,OK.,41,3235
3235,1,13,Ted ,"I guess, what, we'll need fake names?",42,3236
3236,1,13,Victoria ,"Um, you can call me Buttercup.",43,3237
3237,1,13,Ted ,"Pleased to meet you, Buttercup. I'm Lando Calrissian.",44,3238
3238,1,13,Ted ,"Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded...",45,3239
3239,1,13,Barney ,"Ted, Ted, Ted, look, I got a bridesmaid, Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid, Ted, look. See ya Ted.",46,3240
3240,1,13,Ted ,"So, I'm Ted.",47,3241
3241,1,13,Victoria ,Victoria. But no last names.,48,3242
3242,1,13,Ted ,No last names.,49,3243
3243,1,13,Marshall ,Oh.,50,3244
3244,1,13,Lily ,"Oh, what is wrong with you?",51,3245
3245,1,13,Marshall ,"Dude, that is just like... a weenie ass idea.",52,3246
3246,1,13,Ted ,"No, it was awesome. I had a great night, I'm never gonna see her again, and there's no way to ruin it.",53,3247
3247,1,13,Marshall ,"Ted, how do I explain this to you? Last night I had the best cake of my life. You think I'm gonna let that cake out of my life? Hell, no. I'm gonna find out what bakery made that cake and then I'm gonna get some more cake.",54,3248
3248,1,13,Ted ,"That cake really got to you, huh?",55,3249
3249,1,13,Marshall ,It haunts me.,56,3250
3250,1,13,Lily ,"So, what happened next?",57,3251
3251,1,13,,"(flashback to Ted and Victoria at wedding) Victoria: OK, ground rules have been established.",58,3252
3252,1,13,Ted ,Mm-hm.,59,3253
3253,1,13,Victoria ,Now let's see some of these moves I've heard so much about.,60,3254
3254,1,13,Victoria ,Wait wait wait wait wait.,61,3255
3255,1,13,Victoria ,Let's do all the single ladies in this joint a big favor and steal the bouquet.,62,3256
3256,1,13,Ted ,"Yes, but we'll need a diversion.",63,3257
3257,1,13,Ted ,Kiss.,64,3258
3258,1,13,Ted ,"Go. Go, go, go",65,3259
3259,1,13,Lily ,"So, that's what happened to the bouquet. You know, good for Victoria. It's such an evil tradition.",66,3260
3260,1,13,Ted ,You're not gonna do it at your wedding?,67,3261
3261,1,13,Lily ,"Oh, yeah, I'm gonna take that flower grenade and chuck it into the crowd and scream, crawl for it, bitches. It's just what girls do.",68,3262
3262,1,13,Marshall ,"So, where did you guys go?",69,3263
3263,1,13,Ted ,Very nice.,70,3264
3264,1,13,Victoria ,Yeah?,71,3265
3265,1,13,Victoria ,"OK, I don't really know how to tap-dance.",72,3266
3266,1,13,Ted ,I couldn't really tell.,73,3267
3267,1,13,Ted ,"Well, it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight.",74,3268
3268,1,13,Victoria ,"Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some.",75,3269
3269,1,13,Ted ,No you couldn't.,76,3270
3270,1,13,Victoria ,You're a dude. I could totally...,77,3271
3271,1,13,Ted ,Totally get some.,78,3272
3272,1,13,Victoria ,We're not gonna kiss tonight.,79,3273
3273,1,13,Victoria ,"If we kiss, all of this becomes real. You, you might use too much tongue, or not use enough and then suddenly, poof, spell's broken.",80,3274
3274,1,13,Ted ,I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.,81,3275
3275,1,13,Victoria ,"OK, how about this? The best part of any first-kiss is the lead-up to it, the moment right before the lips touch. It's like a big drumroll. So, how about, tonight, we just stick with the drumroll.",82,3276
3276,1,13,Ted ,OK.,83,3277
3277,1,13,Victoria ,But we can't kiss.,84,3278
3278,1,13,Ted ,OK.,85,3279
3279,1,13,Marshall ,"A drumroll? That's it. So, what, you just said good-night, came home, and performed a drum solo?",86,3280
3280,1,13,Lily ,"Oh, Ted, you're such a doof. I mean, this girl sounds amazing.",87,3281
3281,1,13,Ted ,"She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and we connected on every level. And, I'm never gonna see her again.",88,3282
3282,1,13,Ted ,"Dammit, I have to see her again.",89,3283
3283,1,13,,"Lily, Marshall: Yes.",90,3284
3284,1,13,Marshall ,"So, let's get to work, man. What else do you know about her?",91,3285
3285,1,13,Ted ,"Nothing. Her name's Victoria, that's all I got. Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know.",92,3286
3286,1,13,Lily ,"Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon. She'll be back in two weeks. Call her then.",93,3287
3287,1,13,Ted ,"Yes, two weeks, good idea. I'm calling her now.",94,3288
3288,1,13,Lily ,"No, Ted, you don't mess with a honeymoon.",95,3289
3289,1,13,Marshall ,"Yeah, come on, dude. Ask her about the cake.",96,3290
3290,1,13,Claudia ,Ted?,97,3291
3291,1,13,,"(Ted on phone in his apartment) Ted: Hey, Claudia, great wedding, beautiful toast, touching stuff. How's the honeymoon? Listen, I'm calling because last night I met this girl and I was wondering if you had...",98,3292
3292,1,13,Claudia ,"Oh, you have got to be freakin kidding me.",99,3293
3293,1,13,Stuart ,"Oh, here we go.",100,3294
3294,1,13,Claudia ,"24 hours ago, you were begging, begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding, and now, what, you're over her?",101,3295
3295,1,13,Ted ,I've moved on.,102,3296
3296,1,13,Claudia ,"What was her name? Was it my fat cousin, Lindsay? Don't be embarrassed. She has pretty eyes.",103,3297
3297,1,13,Ted ,"Uh, no, her name was Victoria, I don't know her last name.",104,3298
3298,1,13,Claudia ,"Well, lucky for you, I know that guest list backwards and forwards.",105,3299
3299,1,13,Ted ,Thank God.,106,3300
3300,1,13,Claudia ,"Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria at my wedding. Good-bye, Ted.",107,3301
3301,1,13,Ted ,There was no Victoria at the wedding.,108,3302
3302,1,13,Lily ,"Maybe she used a second fake name. Oh, she's good, she's very good.",109,3303
3303,1,13,Marshall ,"Maybe she was a ghost. That's why she didn't wanna kiss you, because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second. Oh my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay.",110,3304
3304,1,13,Ted ,Marshall. She was not a ghost.,111,3305
3305,1,13,Marshall ,"I know that she wasn't a ghost, she picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form.",112,3306
3306,1,13,Ted ,"Wait, wait, wait, she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids. She must have been at their table. Maybe they know who she was?",113,3307
3307,1,13,Lily ,Great. How do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?,114,3308
3308,1,13,Barney ,"This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what?",115,3309
3309,1,13,Nirvana ,Barney.,116,3310
3310,1,13,Barney ,Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste.,117,3311
3311,1,13,Ted ,"Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?",118,3312
3312,1,13,Barney ,You know I did.,119,3313
3313,1,13,Ted ,Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me.,120,3314
3314,1,13,Barney ,You know I won't.,121,3315
3315,1,13,Ted ,Why not?,122,3316
3316,1,13,Barney ,"Because we just hooked up last night. I can't call the girl the next day. I have to wait at least, like, forever. Oh snap. Never gonna call her. Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.",123,3317
3317,1,13,Lily ,"Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.",124,3318
3318,1,13,Barney ,"Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night.",125,3319
3319,1,13,Ted ,"OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.",126,3320
3320,1,13,Barney ,Really? Ted: Yeah.,127,3321
3321,1,13,Barney ,But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing.,128,3322
3322,1,13,Ted ,I'm ready to be proven wrong.,129,3323
3323,1,13,Barney ,Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial.,130,3324
3324,1,13,Barney ,"(on phone) Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.",131,3325
3325,1,13,Barney ,(to Ted) What kind of shoes...,132,3326
3326,1,13,Barney ,"(on phone) Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing.",133,3327
3327,1,13,Ted ,Actually.,134,3328
3328,1,13,Barney ,Oh come on.,135,3329
3329,1,13,Victoria ,Hey.,136,3330
3330,1,13,Ted ,"So, what do you want to do next?",137,3331
3331,1,13,Victoria ,Uh...,138,3332
3332,1,13,Ted ,Don't think...first thing that comes into your mind.,139,3333
3333,1,13,Victoria ,Hold this.,140,3334
3334,1,13,Ted ,Whoa. There she goes.,141,3335
3335,1,13,Barney ,(on phone) Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them.,142,3336
3336,1,13,Barney ,"Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight.",143,3337
3337,1,13,Ted ,I understand.,144,3338
3338,1,13,Lily ,"OK, let's not lose hope. We'll call the hotel, maybe she was staying there. We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria. Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...",145,3339
3339,1,13,Marshall ,Or Ictor. Probably doesn't go by Ictor.,146,3340
3340,1,13,Ted ,"No, you know what? This is fate. I am never supposed to see this girl again. That was the whole point of the night. I've just been saved from myself. Let's drink many beers.",147,3341
3341,1,13,Marshall ,Agreed.,148,3342
3342,1,13,Future Ted VO," And I thought that was the end of it, but then...",149,3343
3343,1,13,Lily ,"Hey, there's the anchor lady! How was it?",150,3344
3344,1,13,Robin ,"Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor. Robin? Thanks, Robin, it was awesome. Back to you, Robin.",151,3345
3345,1,13,Lily ,"Congrats, that's so cool.",152,3346
3346,1,13,Robin ,"Yeah, I felt really bad bailing on Ted though.",153,3347
3347,1,13,Lily ,"Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...",154,3348
3348,1,13,Future Ted VO," And then Lily told her the whole story, right down to the brown shoes with the little snowflakes on them, and by the end of it...",155,3349
3349,1,13,Lily ,What?,156,3350
3350,1,13,Robin ,I know who she is.,157,3351
3351,1,13,Lily ,"You know who she is? But, you weren't even at the wedding.",158,3352
3352,1,13,Robin ,"Actually, I kind of was.",159,3353
3353,1,13,Lily ,What?,160,3354
3354,1,13,Robin ,"Well, after the newscast, I was so excited, I decided to surprise Ted by going to the reception.",161,3355
3355,1,13,Robin ,Dammit. Stop it. What the hell?,162,3356
3356,1,13,Victoria ,Hello? You OK in there?,163,3357
3357,1,13,Robin ,"Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just allergies or something. I'm fine.",164,3358
3358,1,13,Victoria ,"Listen, do you wanna come and cry out here? I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.",165,3359
3359,1,13,Robin ,"Oh, thanks, but I don't actually cry in front of people, or cry at all for that matter. Man, it's gross. Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?",166,3360
3360,1,13,Victoria ,"Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter. So, why are you crying?",167,3361
3361,1,13,Lily ,Because you have feelings for Ted.,168,3362
3362,1,13,Robin ,"I don't know, maybe.",169,3363
3363,1,13,Lily ,"OK, what is wrong with the two of you?! Seriously. He likes you and you like him, just, just, just be together. Geez, Louise, happiness is not that difficult.",170,3364
3364,1,13,Robin ,"Oh, look, OK. Yes, I cried in the bathroom, and that was weird. But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy. The fact is I don't know how I feel.",171,3365
3365,1,13,Lily ,Yes you do. Seeing him with someone else and crying about it. Guess what? That's how you feel. That is nothing but how you feel.,172,3366
3366,1,13,Robin ,"OK, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy? Lily: Kinda, yeah.",173,3367
3367,1,13,Robin ,But it doesn't change anything. I still don't wanna get married and he's still... Ted. What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he could be happy.,174,3368
3368,1,13,Lily ,Or you could tell him you're into him and then you could both be happy.,175,3369
3369,1,13,Robin ,I'm gonna go find him.,176,3370
3370,1,13,Lily ,"Well, wait. Which one are you gonna tell him?",177,3371
3371,1,13,Robin ,I have no idea.,178,3372
3372,1,13,Barney ,"And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for s*x.",179,3373
3373,1,13,Barney ,I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.,180,3374
3374,1,13,Robin ,"Hi, guys,",181,3375
3375,1,13,Ted ,Hey.,182,3376
3376,1,13,Robin ,"Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?",183,3377
3377,1,13,Ted ,Sure. What's up?,184,3378
3378,1,13,Robin ,"Uh, I, I have to tell you something.",185,3379
3379,1,13,Ted ,Oh.,186,3380
3380,1,13,Robin ,"Oh, just get it.",187,3381
3381,1,13,Ted ,Hello.,188,3382
3382,1,13,Stuart ,"Ted, it's Stuart. My lovely bride would like to say something to you.",189,3383
3383,1,13,Claudia ,Ted. I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier. My new husband and a vodka cranberry which cost $10.50 at the freakin' airport bar. When is this plane going to board?!,190,3384
3384,1,13,Stuart ,Sweet pea.,191,3385
3385,1,13,Claudia ,Have helped me realize that sometimes I can act like a crazy person. And I don't want my new husband to think I'm a crazy person.,192,3386
3386,1,13,Ted ,"It's fine, Claudia. Don't worry about it.",193,3387
3387,1,13,Ted ,"Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake.",194,3388
3388,1,13,Claudia ,Cake.,195,3389
3389,1,13,Victoria ,Why don't you take this? Sounds like you could use it.,196,3390
3390,1,13,Robin ,"Thanks. You're very sweet. So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?",197,3391
3391,1,13,Claudia ,We got it at this little bakery downtown.,198,3392
3392,1,13,Victoria ,"Actually, neither.",199,3393
3393,1,13,Claudia ,It's called the Buttercup Bakery.,200,3394
3394,1,13,Victoria ,I made the cake.,201,3395
3395,1,13,Ted ,She made the cake.,202,3396
3396,1,13,Ted ,Buttercup Bakery. She wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest. She made the cake.,203,3397
3397,1,13,Marshall ,"She made that cake. Ted, this is the girl. You gotta marry her, today. She has to move in with us.",204,3398
3398,1,13,Ted ,I'm going down to that bakery.,205,3399
3399,1,13,Lily ,"No, no, don't do it.",206,3400
3400,1,13,Marshall ,"Baby, what are you talking about?!",207,3401
3401,1,13,Ted ,"Yeah, all day long, you've been busting my apple bag about finding this girl.",208,3402
3402,1,13,Lily ,"Well, I just think that maybe she's not that into you and that's why she didn't give you her number. Robin, care to chime in with anything? Robin: Yes. Ted. Go get her.",209,3403
3403,1,13,Ted ,Going. Getting.,210,3404
3404,1,13,Barney ,"Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up!",211,3405
3405,1,13,Ted ,Yes! No.,212,3406
3406,1,13,Barney ,Oh come on!,213,3407
3407,1,13,Ted ,Whoa. Guess we were gone a while.,214,3408
3408,1,13,Victoria ,"Well, that's too bad. I was looking forward to one last dance.",215,3409
3409,1,13,Ted ,"Why yes I am. Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking.",216,3410
3410,1,13,Victoria ,"Wow, what was I thinking?",217,3411
3411,1,13,Ted ,"Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.",218,3412
3412,1,13,Victoria ,"You got me, you are good.",219,3413
3413,1,13,Ted ,"You know, I don't look like this every day. On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.",220,3414
3414,1,13,Victoria ,The real Ted sounds real sexy. It's too bad I'll never get to see it.,221,3415
3415,1,13,Lily ,Buttercup Bakery. This is it.,222,3416
3416,1,13,Marshall ,"Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.",223,3417
3417,1,13,Barney ,"Ted, you still with us?",224,3418
3418,1,13,Ted ,Tell me your last name.,225,3419
3419,1,13,Ted ,"You know, there's one little flaw in our plan.",226,3420
3420,1,13,Victoria ,What's that?,227,3421
3421,1,13,Ted ,I'm gonna go home tonight with a lot of great memories and one really sucky memory: the memory of you walking out that door.,228,3422
3422,1,13,Victoria ,"Hey, Ted.",229,3423
3423,1,13,Ted ,Yeah?,230,3424
3424,1,13,Victoria ,"Close your eyes, and count to five.",231,3425
3425,1,13,Ted ,"One, two, three, four, five.",232,3426
3426,1,13,Ted ,"And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be...",233,3427
3427,1,13,Barney ,"The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot.",234,3428
3428,1,13,Ted ,OK.,235,3429
3429,1,13,Victoria ,Oh thank God.,236,3430
3430,1,14,,"Ted from 2030: When you meet someone special, suddenly life is full of firsts. The first kiss. The first night together. The first weekend together. For me, all those firsts happened within 48 hours of meeting Victoria.",1,3431
3431,1,14,Marshall ,"They have to come out soon, it's Monday.",2,3432
3432,1,14,Lily ,Do you think they've been in there the whole time? I don't know whether to be proud or concerned.,3,3433
3433,1,14,Marshall ,Maybe they're not even in there.,4,3434
3434,1,14,Victoria ,Good morning.,5,3435
3435,1,14,Ted ,"Hey, guys.",6,3436
3436,1,14,Victoria ,I'm just going to ignore that.,7,3437
3437,1,14,Marshall ,Thank you!,8,3438
3438,1,14,Ted ,I wish you could stay.,9,3439
3439,1,14,Victoria ,"I know, me, too. But I have to go to work, and you have that meeting.",10,3440
3440,1,14,Ted ,Call you afterwards?,11,3441
3441,1,14,Victoria ,I'll inappropriately text you during. Bye.,12,3442
3442,1,14,Ted ,Bye.,13,3443
3443,1,14,Marshall ,Two days straight?!,14,3444
3444,1,14,Lily ,"Wow, your room must smell like a monkey cage!",15,3445
3445,1,14,Marshall ,"Come on, give us a number. Lily guessed eight, but I know my boy got to double digits.",16,3446
3446,1,14,Ted ,Zero.,17,3447
3447,1,14,Marshall ,What?,18,3448
3448,1,14,Lily ,What?,19,3449
3449,1,14,Ted ,"Guys, we just met. And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick, so we talked about it, and we decided to take this one slow.",20,3450
3450,1,14,Marshall ,Her idea.,21,3451
3451,1,14,Ted ,"Totally her idea! But, I don't know, I'm really into this girl, and if going slow is what it takes to make this happen, I say bring it on.",22,3452
3452,1,14,Ted ,I don't feel so good. t's like my testicles mixed pop rocks and soda.,23,3453
3453,1,14,Marshall ,I can't believe she's making you wait a whole month. I would never put up with that.,24,3454
3454,1,14,Ted ,You've only had s*x with one girl in your whole life.,25,3455
3455,1,14,Lily ,Burn!,26,3456
3456,1,14,Barney ,"Ted, the only reason to wait a month for s*x is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.",27,3457
3457,1,14,Robin ,Good news: I don't have to cover the cat show tomorrow night. Who's up for hanging out?,28,3458
3458,1,14,Ted ,"Oh, I can't, I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.",29,3459
3459,1,14,Lily ,"No, no, we can't, it's our nine-year anniversary.",30,3460
3460,1,14,Robin ,"Wow, nine years? Your relationship's a fourth grader. Congrats.",31,3461
3461,1,14,Lily ,Thanks. We're going to the Berkshires for the maple syrup harvest.,32,3462
3462,1,14,Marshall ,"It's one of New York Magazine's ""Top five romantic getaways on a budget."" Who says sexual can't be sensible?",33,3463
3463,1,14,Robin ,"Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me.",34,3464
3464,1,14,Barney ,Really?,35,3465
3465,1,14,Robin ,"Actually, I was talking to my martini.",36,3466
3466,1,14,Marshall ,Ready to go?,37,3467
3467,1,14,Lily ,"Hell, yeah. Nothing better than a weekend at a good bed and breakfast.",38,3468
3468,1,14,Marshall ,Yeah. Waking up for breakfast at 7:00 A.M....Sharp.,39,3469
3469,1,14,Lily ,Complimenting the odors and their collection of needle-point geese.,40,3470
3470,1,14,Marshall ,Awkward conversations with middle-aged couples trying to stave off divorce.,41,3471
3471,1,14,Lily ,"Yeah, well, we'd better get going, it's like a four-hour drive.",42,3472
3472,1,14,Marshall ,And it's supposed to rain tonight.,43,3473
3473,1,14,Lily ,Or we could just stay home.,44,3474
3474,1,14,Marshall ,Maybe watch some TV.,45,3475
3475,1,14,Lily ,Order in some Chinese.,46,3476
3476,1,14,Marshall ,"Oh, Sichuan Garden! Are we really bailing?",47,3477
3477,1,14,Lily ,"Hell, yeah.",48,3478
3478,1,14,Marshall ,"Good, cause this thing's empty.",49,3479
3479,1,14,Barney ,"Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say ""wow.""",50,3480
3480,1,14,Robin ,"Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident.",51,3481
3481,1,14,Barney ,It's one of the many risks of the blind approach. It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot. But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.,52,3482
3482,1,14,Robin ,Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?,53,3483
3483,1,14,Barney ,You can't just... Wow!,54,3484
3484,1,14,Robin ,Hey? What's taking so long? I have to go.,55,3485
3485,1,14,Barney ,"Not so fast, Scherbotsky. I like the way you think. That mirror thing. Simple. Elegant. Okay, limited-time offer: I need a ""bro"" for my bro-ings on about town. How would you like to be said bro?",56,3486
3486,1,14,Robin ,"Well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped. She really needs some support... or a stranger's tongue down her throat. That seems healthy. All right. Guess I'm in.",57,3487
3487,1,14,Victoria ,So... one more week and it'll be a month.,58,3488
3488,1,14,Ted ,"Really? Are you sure? Wow, that snuck up on me.",59,3489
3489,1,14,Victoria ,"Oh, come on.",60,3490
3490,1,14,Ted ,The 18th can't get here fast enough.,61,3491
3491,1,14,Victoria ,"Wait, the 18th? Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this... I'm going to be out of town on the 18th!",62,3492
3492,1,14,Ted ,"Oh. Well, um, we can just... wait until you get back. I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this.",63,3493
3493,1,14,Victoria ,Yeah. Or we could do it tonight.,64,3494
3494,1,14,Ted ,75th and Amsterdam.,65,3495
3495,1,14,Lily ,I'm so glad we decided to just stay home.,66,3496
3496,1,14,Marshall ,"Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone? We'd be just getting there now, all tired and cranky.",67,3497
3497,1,14,Lily ,And yet we'd feel obligated to have s*x.,68,3498
3498,1,14,Marshall ,"Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it. I would like to propose a toast. To the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever.",69,3499
3499,1,14,Ted ,I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend.,70,3500
3500,1,14,Victoria ,I'm so glad your roommates are out of town.,71,3501
3501,1,14,Lily ,"Oh, my God, what are they doing home?",72,3502
3502,1,14,Marshall ,"They think we went away. Oh, it is on for my boy, Ted.",73,3503
3503,1,14,Lily ,"But we didn't go away, we're in the bathroom.",74,3504
3504,1,14,Marshall ,They don't know that. All we have to do is hide out in here until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom.,75,3505
3505,1,14,Lily ,But I don't want to hide out in here.,76,3506
3506,1,14,Marshall ,"Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this. If we go out there and spoil the mood, it's not going to happen. Then one of us is going to have to have s*x with Ted, and... not going to be me.",77,3507
3507,1,14,Lily ,"Okay, fine. I guess I'll actually floss.",78,3508
3508,1,14,Barney ,You suited up!,79,3509
3509,1,14,Robin ,"Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right.",80,3510
3510,1,14,Barney ,Emilio? The woman will have...,81,3511
3511,1,14,Robin ,"I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks.",82,3512
3512,1,14,Barney ,"Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. ""The Torpedo."" Or, as the rollers call it, ""Piramide.""",83,3513
3513,1,14,Robin ,"My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention.",84,3514
3514,1,14,Barney ,Father issues. Hot.,85,3515
3515,1,14,Robin ,I know... I was this close to being a huge slut.,86,3516
3516,1,14,Barney ,"Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl.",87,3517
3517,1,14,Robin ,"Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have s*x to get pregnant.",88,3518
3518,1,14,Barney ,What up! Freeze frame high five!,89,3519
3519,1,14,Victoria ,I think this may be a perfect moment. I wish we could hold onto it forever.,90,3520
3520,1,14,Ted ,"No. Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting. By its very nature, it... slips through our fingers... making it that much more precious.",91,3521
3521,1,14,Lily ,"Ugh, that is bad. That is, like, high-school-literary-magazine bad.",92,3522
3522,1,14,Marshall ,And they're not even high.,93,3523
3523,1,14,Lily ,It's actually working.,94,3524
3524,1,14,Marshall ,"Yeah, smooth but slowly. God, close the deal, already. It's been, like, 45 minutes... we could have had s*x three times by now.",95,3525
3525,1,14,Lily ,"Yeah, try five.",96,3526
3526,1,14,Marshall ,What up! Maybe we should just go out there.,97,3527
3527,1,14,Lily ,No way! We can't go out there now. They'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time. It'll be too weird.,98,3528
3528,1,14,Marshall ,Fine. But if we're stuck in here... I'm turning up the volume. Shh. Shh.,99,3529
3529,1,14,Victoria ,"I want to know you. Like, know your soul. Ted, what makes you cry?",100,3530
3530,1,14,Lily ,"Honey, could you hold my hair back, I think I'm going to hurl.",101,3531
3531,1,14,Robin ,So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?,102,3532
3532,1,14,Barney ,Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still...,103,3533
3533,1,14,Robin ,What?,104,3534
3534,1,14,Barney ,There is one other thing we could do. If you're up for it.,105,3535
3535,1,14,Robin ,"Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!",106,3536
3536,1,14,Barney ,"Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months.",107,3537
3537,1,14,Robin ,"Oh, I believe it... this is awesome!",108,3538
3538,1,14,Barney ,"Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you?",109,3539
3539,1,14,Robin ,Thank me later. Let's keep moving. These little bastards are everywhere.,110,3540
3540,1,14,Marshall ,He's just staring into her eyes.,111,3541
3541,1,14,Lily ,"I don't know, we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us.",112,3542
3542,1,14,Marshall ,Yeah... now we just make fun of people like that. It's the circle of life.,113,3543
3543,1,14,Lily ,"No, I'm serious, Marshall. I mean, we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip. And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom.",114,3544
3544,1,14,Marshall ,"Well, it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria. This is their first time.",115,3545
3545,1,14,Lily ,"Yeah, but we could still have some more romance. Now, you just say, ""Want to do it?"" And I say, ""Yeah.""",116,3546
3546,1,14,Marshall ,Want to...,117,3547
3547,1,14,Lily ,No! Maybe we're just out of firsts.,118,3548
3548,1,14,Marshall ,Looks like they're about to have theirs.,119,3549
3549,1,14,Ted ,Should we take this to the bedroom?,120,3550
3550,1,14,Marshall ,Yes!,121,3551
3551,1,14,Lily ,Yes!,122,3552
3552,1,14,Victoria ,Yes.,123,3553
3553,1,14,Marshall ,Yes!,124,3554
3554,1,14,Lily ,Yes!,125,3555
3555,1,14,Marshall ,"No. No, don't answer it!",126,3556
3556,1,14,Victoria ,You can answer it. We have all night.,127,3557
3557,1,14,Marshall ,You're answering it? He's answering it!,128,3558
3558,1,14,Lily ,No! Do her! Do her now!,129,3559
3559,1,14,Ted ,Sure. Good luck with that. (He hangs up) Sorry about that.,130,3560
3560,1,14,Victoria ,How about a little more wine?,131,3561
3561,1,14,Ted ,I'll get another bottle.,132,3562
3562,1,14,Lily ,I need a drink. Do we have any cough syrup in here?,133,3563
3563,1,14,Marshall ,Shh...,134,3564
3564,1,14,Robin ,"Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it.",135,3565
3565,1,14,Barney ,No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does.,136,3566
3566,1,14,Robin ,But I...,137,3567
3567,1,14,Barney ,"Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky.",138,3568
3568,1,14,Robin ,See you on the other side.,139,3569
3569,1,14,Barney ,Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?,140,3570
3570,1,14,Robin ,Yeah.,141,3571
3571,1,14,Barney ,All right.,142,3572
3572,1,14,Lily ,"Marshall, what happened to us? We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long. Have we lost that?",143,3573
3573,1,14,Marshall ,"Maybe. But I think I just found it. Right here. Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering with just a hint of crazy eyes.",144,3574
3574,1,14,Lily ,"Okay, well, get ready for my sex-ray vision. Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning? Oh, damn it.",145,3575
3575,1,14,Marshall ,It's all right. We can do this.,146,3576
3576,1,14,Lily ,Let's just hold hands. This is nice.,147,3577
3577,1,14,Marshall ,You love that move. It's a classic Marshall.,148,3578
3578,1,14,Lily ,"All right, we totally suck at this. We really, really need to get out of here.",149,3579
3579,1,14,Marshall ,"Well, we can't.",150,3580
3580,1,14,Lily ,"Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you, it'll change the entire nature of our relationship.",151,3581
3581,1,14,Marshall ,What is it?,152,3582
3582,1,14,Lily ,I have to pee.,153,3583
3583,1,14,Marshall ,This is bad.,154,3584
3584,1,14,Lily ,Yeah.,155,3585
3585,1,14,Marshall ,We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other. You always think there'll be more time.,156,3586
3586,1,14,Lily ,"Look at us. We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet. The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it, it might go out forever.",157,3587
3587,1,14,Marshall ,How much longer do you think you can hold it?,158,3588
3588,1,14,Lily ,I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon.,159,3589
3589,1,14,Marshall ,"Oh, boy.",160,3590
3590,1,14,Robin ,Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game.,161,3591
3591,1,14,Barney ,Neither have I. Of course I cheat.,162,3592
3592,1,14,Robin ,"Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L.",163,3593
3593,1,14,Barney ,Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.,164,3594
3594,1,14,Robin ,"Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox.",165,3595
3595,1,14,Barney ,"Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt.",166,3596
3596,1,14,Robin ,That's a woman.,167,3597
3597,1,14,Barney ,"Oh, my mistake. Or is it?",168,3598
3598,1,14,Robin ,Let's just focus on your target.,169,3599
3599,1,14,Barney ,Right.,170,3600
3600,1,14,Robin ,"Yeah, I got this one. Oh, my God. I love your jeans.",171,3601
3601,1,14,Woman ,Okay. Is this a lesbian bar? Because that girl with the blue shirt just...,172,3602
3602,1,14,Robin ,"Oh, no. I am all about the dudes. Although pickings are pretty slim tonight. Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get.",173,3603
3603,1,14,Woman ,Really? 'Cause he's totally vibing me right now. Must be the jeans.,174,3604
3604,1,14,Robin ,"Well, jeans will only get you so far. I'm going home with him.",175,3605
3605,1,14,Woman ,We'll see about that.,176,3606
3606,1,14,Lily ,"Oh, my God, I hate Ted. I hate him so much.",177,3607
3607,1,14,Marshall ,"Baby, why don't you just go? Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other.",178,3608
3608,1,14,Lily ,"No, but we haven't, because I want to keep some of the mystery alive.",179,3609
3609,1,14,Marshall ,"Well, you have farted in front of me.",180,3610
3610,1,14,Lily ,"Yes, but I always cover it with a cough.",181,3611
3611,1,14,Marshall ,You always do.,182,3612
3612,1,14,Barney ,Hey.,183,3613
3613,1,14,Robin ,Hey.,184,3614
3614,1,14,Barney ,Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.,185,3615
3615,1,14,Robin ,What happened?,186,3616
3616,1,14,Barney ,"Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release.",187,3617
3617,1,14,Robin ,But why?,188,3618
3618,1,14,Barney ,Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores.,189,3619
3619,1,14,Robin ,"Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship?",190,3620
3620,1,14,Barney ,Hit!,191,3621
3621,1,14,Victoria ,"Ted, I can't wait any longer.",192,3622
3622,1,14,Ted ,Should we move to the bedroom?,193,3623
3623,1,14,Victoria ,There's no time for that.,194,3624
3624,1,14,Marshall ,"They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour, but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom?",195,3625
3625,1,14,Lily ,"Baby, I can't hold it in any longer. It's time.",196,3626
3626,1,14,Marshall ,I know.,197,3627
3627,1,14,Lily ,"I love you, Marshall.",198,3628
3628,1,14,Marshall ,"I love you, Lily.",199,3629
3629,1,14,Barney ,"Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake.",200,3630
3630,1,14,Robin ,"Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys.",201,3631
3631,1,14,Barney ,Hard-core? That's the only way I play. (Barney strips down),202,3632
3632,1,14,Robin ,I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing?,203,3633
3633,1,14,Barney ,"I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me?",204,3634
3634,1,14,Robin ,No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends.,205,3635
3635,1,14,Barney ,"Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night.",206,3636
3636,1,14,Robin ,What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.,207,3637
3637,1,14,Barney ,"You invited me up to your apartment to ""play Battleship."" Is that not an internationally recognized term for s*x?",208,3638
3638,1,14,Robin ,No.,209,3639
3639,1,14,Barney ,Great. I hope you're happy. You sunk my battleship.,210,3640
3640,1,14,Lily ,I'm okay. You okay?,211,3641
3641,1,14,Marshall ,"I feel the same. And yet, strangely different.",212,3642
3642,1,14,Lily ,"I'm happy for my bladder, yet sad for us.",213,3643
3643,1,14,Marshall ,"You had to do it, sweetie... for Ted. And, hey, look, at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes.",214,3644
3644,1,14,Lily ,"Yeah. I guess our relationship had to take a hit so a new one out there could blossom. Oh, crap!",215,3645
3645,1,14,Marshall ,They must have heard that.,216,3646
3646,1,14,Lily ,"Well, I guess we can come out now. I don't believe it. They're gone.",217,3647
3647,1,14,Marshall ,Good. 'Cause I got to take a whiz.,218,3648
3648,1,14,Robin ,"Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second...",219,3649
3649,1,14,Barney ,"But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well.",220,3650
3650,1,14,Robin ,"Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted?",221,3651
3651,1,14,Barney ,I checked with Ted.,222,3652
3652,1,14,Barney ,"Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well, I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right? I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin, you'd be cool with that, right?",223,3653
3653,1,14,Ted ,Sure. Good luck with that.,224,3654
3654,1,14,Barney ,Totally gave us his blessing.,225,3655
3655,1,14,Robin ,Really?,226,3656
3656,1,14,Barney ,Really.,227,3657
3657,1,14,Robin ,So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?,228,3658
3658,1,14,Barney ,Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh...,229,3659
3659,1,14,Robin ,What?,230,3660
3660,1,14,Barney ,You like Ted.,231,3661
3661,1,14,Robin ,I didn't say I liked Ted.,232,3662
3662,1,14,Barney ,You like Ted. Wow. This is huge.,233,3663
3663,1,14,Robin ,"Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for...",234,3664
3664,1,14,Barney ,"Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?",235,3665
3665,1,14,Robin ,"You're not gonna tell him, are you?",236,3666
3666,1,14,Barney ,No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro.,237,3667
3667,1,14,Robin ,A-7.,238,3668
3668,1,14,Barney ,Miss.,239,3669
3669,1,14,Robin ,Of course.,240,3670
3670,1,14,Marshall ,"Well, we still have one frontier left. Still got the deuce.",241,3671
3671,1,14,Lily ,Not making me feel better.,242,3672
3672,1,14,Marshall ,"Well, it certainly was a first.",243,3673
3673,1,14,Lily ,"It was, wasn't it? We still have firsts.",244,3674
3674,1,14,Marshall ,"Of course we do. And you know what, I actually feel closer to you now. I want to know you. Like, know your soul.",245,3675
3675,1,14,Lily ,"Marshall, what makes you cry?",246,3676
3676,1,14,Marshall ,This moment is fleeting because it's being chased by another moment.,247,3677
3677,1,14,Lily ,"Oh, just grab my boob already.",248,3678
3678,1,14,Ted ,"Come on, guys, get a room.",249,3679
3679,1,15,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, something you might not know about your Uncle Marshall is that he's always been good at games. I mean, unbeatable. Gin! Yahtzee! Poker!",1,3680
3680,1,15,Ted ,"You don't have to shout out ""poker"" when you win.",2,3681
3681,1,15,Marshall ,I know. It's just fun to say.,3,3682
3682,1,15,,"Ted from 2030: We all finally agreed Marshall should be running our game nights instead of playing in them. Which he took to mean, ""invent your own game.""",4,3683
3683,1,15,Marshall ,"It's called ""Marsh-gammon."" It combines all the best features of all the best games... Candy Land, I Never, Pictionary.",5,3684
3684,1,15,Robin ,"Backgammon, obviously.",6,3685
3685,1,15,Marshall ,"No. Backgammon sucks. I took the only good part of backgammon, the ""gammon,"" and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs.",7,3686
3686,1,15,Lily ,I'm so excited Victoria's coming.,8,3687
3687,1,15,Robin ,I'm going to go get another round.,9,3688
3688,1,15,Ted ,"Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight. Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot, so don't say anything embarrass... Don't say anything. And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin, so we you could just avoid the...",10,3689
3689,1,15,Barney ,"Well, well, well. How rich. You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend, yet, you have been lying to her since day one. Excuse me.Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on. So, nothing for him to stand on? Okay, and thanks so much. Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin? I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return.",11,3690
3690,1,15,Ted ,No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that.,12,3691
3691,1,15,Lily ,"Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return?",13,3692
3692,1,15,Ted ,"Nothing. It's nothing. And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria?",14,3693
3693,1,15,Lily ,Us? What would we do?,15,3694
3694,1,15,Ted ,"Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have and, in fact, moved here to get away from. However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight?",16,3695
3695,1,15,Marshall ,Fine.,17,3696
3696,1,15,Lily ,Fine.,18,3697
3697,1,15,Ted ,Thank you.,19,3698
3698,1,15,Lily ,I should go help Robin.,20,3699
3699,1,15,Robin ,Hey.,21,3700
3700,1,15,Lily ,"Hey. So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight?",22,3701
3701,1,15,Robin ,"Oh, sure. She's great. Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted? No. Victoria's great. She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great. I said, ""She's great"" too many times, didn't I?",23,3702
3702,1,15,Lily ,You must really hate the bitch.,24,3703
3703,1,15,Marshall ,"But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest, then you ""Marshall out,"" and all your chips go into the pot, and remember, if you ever ask the question ""What?"", then... you got to drink. Got it?",25,3704
3704,1,15,All ,No,26,3705
3705,1,15,Marshall ,"Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just start, you guys'll pick it up. Newbie goes first. Roll.",27,3706
3706,1,15,Victoria ,Okay.,28,3707
3707,1,15,Marshall ,"Three! You got Autobiography. Now, that's where you have to answer a personal question about your dating life truthfully in order to move on.",29,3708
3708,1,15,Ted ,"Marshall, come on.",30,3709
3709,1,15,Marshall ,"Hey, she's the one who rolled a three. Victoria, ""Have you ever cheated while in a relationship?"" Wow, good question.",31,3710
3710,1,15,Ted ,You don't have to answer that.,32,3711
3711,1,15,Victoria ,"It's okay. Um, well, I was in a really crappy relationship in college, and I wound up kissing this guy at a party one night, and I felt terrible about it, so, I came clean, and we broke up.",33,3712
3712,1,15,Marshall ,"Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer. You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains.",34,3713
3713,1,15,Barney ,"So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?",35,3714
3714,1,15,Victoria ,What?,36,3715
3715,1,15,Marshall ,"You said what, you got to drink!",37,3716
3716,1,15,Lily ,"Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd, and the host said she knew you. What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?",38,3717
3717,1,15,Barney ,"Shannon?! Shannon, Shannon... No, don't remember any Shannon.",39,3718
3718,1,15,Lily ,"Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give...",40,3719
3719,1,15,Barney ,Where's the tape?,41,3720
3720,1,15,Lily ,Fine. I'll go get it.,42,3721
3721,1,15,Barney ,"Cool, okay. You know, whenever.",43,3722
3722,1,15,Marshall ,"Okay, Robin, your roll. Five! Another Autobiography... for the player to your left, which... Victoria!",44,3723
3723,1,15,Ted ,Of course.,45,3724
3724,1,15,Marshall ,"Victoria, ""How many boyfriends did you have before you started dating Ted?""",46,3725
3725,1,15,Ted ,"Wait, the card actually says ""Ted?""",47,3726
3726,1,15,Victoria ,"Okay, uh, well, boyfriends--I guess I've only had... two.",48,3727
3727,1,15,Robin ,Prude alert.,49,3728
3728,1,15,Victoria ,Well... that's serious boyfriends. I've dated other guys in between.,50,3729
3729,1,15,Robin ,"Oh, slut alert!",51,3730
3730,1,15,Barney ,"Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach. Oh, wow, look at that. Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me.",52,3731
3731,1,15,Marshall ,Thank you! Finally somebody understands Marsh-gammon.,53,3732
3732,1,15,Lily ,"Barney, what was on that tape?",54,3733
3733,1,15,Barney ,Too bad you'll never find out.,55,3734
3734,1,15,Lily ,"Oh, damn it! If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse. Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did.",56,3735
3735,1,15,Barney ,What?!,57,3736
3736,1,15,Marshall ,Drink!,58,3737
3737,1,15,Lily ,"Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead. So, should we pop it in?",59,3738
3738,1,15,Barney ,"Give it to me, give it, give me...",60,3739
3739,1,15,Ted ,"Play the tape, play it, play it!",61,3740
3740,1,15,Barney ,"Ted! Fine, fine. You cannot play it. Shannon! I love you! I love you so much. What about us changing the world together? Don't tell me you've forgotten. I know I haven't. Will I ever see another rainbow? Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe? Baby, please Don't go There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love There's a thief in the palace and she's...",62,3741
3741,1,15,Marshall ,Did you try his cell phone?,63,3742
3742,1,15,Ted ,"Yeah, I left two messages. I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard. He's off the grid.",64,3743
3743,1,15,Barney ,"Hey, guys, what up?",65,3744
3744,1,15,Robin ,"Barney, where have you been?",66,3745
3745,1,15,Ted ,"Yeah, we're-we're really sorry about that.",67,3746
3746,1,15,Lily ,"Yeah, so sorry. But seriously, what was up with the tape? No, no, stay.",68,3747
3747,1,15,All ,Come on. Stay!,69,3748
3748,1,15,Barney ,"I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it. It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me.",70,3749
3749,1,15,Marshall ,"Well, we all have embarrassing stories. Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it.",71,3750
3750,1,15,Barney ,"Oh, really? Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall? Show me how good it is.",72,3751
3751,1,15,Marshall ,All right.,73,3752
3752,1,15,Marshall ,"I was stopping by Lily's kindergarten class to say hi, but they were all at recess. I really had to pee, so I went into the class's restroom. It was a-a smaller target than I'm used to, so I figured I should sit down. What I didn't realize was, it was a shared bathroom. I wish I'd pulled up my pants.",74,3753
3753,1,15,Lily ,The kids still call him Funny Butt.,75,3754
3754,1,15,Barney ,"Okay. I'll tell you my story. Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today.",76,3755
3755,1,15,Barney ,"It was 1998. I was just out of college, and I was working at a coffeehouse with my girlfriend. My girlfriend... *Shannon. Yeah, you were meant for me And I was meant for you. Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.* Thank you. All right.",77,3756

3764,1,15,Man ,Whatevs. As long as you're nailing that.,86,3765
3765,1,15,Barney ,"Listen to you. That? You know, women aren't objects. They're human beings. And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we're married. You can read about it in my zine.",87,3766
3766,1,15,Man ,"Hey, haircut, right here. Open up your knowledge basket, 'cause here it comes. Forget that touchy-feely crap. You get money, you get laid. End of discussion.",88,3767
3767,1,15,Barney ,"I feel sorry for you, man.",89,3768
3768,1,15,Man ,"Peace out, hombre.",90,3769
3769,1,15,Barney ,"Suits. Five weeks later, we were all set to leave for the Peace Corps. Only problem was... she never showed up.",91,3770
3770,1,15,Robin ,She never showed?,92,3771
3771,1,15,Ted ,"So, what happened next?",93,3772
3772,1,15,Barney ,You know what? This was a mistake.,94,3773
3773,1,15,Lily ,Wait... What if somebody else told their most humiliating story?,95,3774
3774,1,15,Marshall ,"Oh, I know just how to decide who.",96,3775
3775,1,15,Lily ,You brought the game to the bar?,97,3776
3776,1,15,Marshall ,"Well, we're not quitting just 'cause Ted's so far ahead.",98,3777
3777,1,15,Ted ,I was winning?,99,3778
3778,1,15,Robin ,Fine. I'll go next.,100,3779
3779,1,15,Robin ,I was doing a report on live TV about a hansom cab driver.,101,3780

3781,1,15,Ted ,"Yeah, we all know that one.",103,3782
3782,1,15,Victoria ,"Okay, how about this? I will tell you my most humiliating story.",104,3783
3783,1,15,Marshall ,"Yeah, Victoria, way to step up!",105,3784
3784,1,15,Victoria ,"Okay, it involves a game of truth or dare, a squeeze-bottle of marshmallow ice cream topping, and the hot tub at my grandparents' retirement community.",106,3785
3785,1,15,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, I tell you a lot of inappropriate stories, but there's no way in hell I'm telling you this one. Don't worry, though, it wasn't that great.",107,3786
3786,1,15,Marshall ,That is the greatest story ever!,108,3787

3788,1,15,Ted ,"Wow, wow!",110,3789
3789,1,15,Barney ,"Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy. My saga... continues.",111,3790
3790,1,15,Barney ,I went back to the coffeehouse to find Shannon.,112,3791

3797,1,15,Shannon ,"Barney, it's your dream. It's only two years. I know we can make it.",119,3798
3798,1,15,Barney ,"As I walked away, I realized Shannon was an adult. Her father couldn't control her life. I had to go back and confront him. She was in the middle of a heated argument with her dad.",120,3799
3799,1,15,Marshall ,Now we all got to drink.,121,3800
3800,1,15,Ted ,"Oh, my God. What happened next?",122,3801
3801,1,15,Barney ,"I don't know, guys.",123,3802
3802,1,15,Lily ,"Okay, okay. Marshall's mom sent us cookies...",124,3803
3803,1,15,Marshall ,"Lily, no!",125,3804
3804,1,15,Lily ,"For the team, Marshall, for the team.",126,3805
3805,1,15,Lily ,"Hey, Mrs. Eriksen, it's Lily. Thank you so much for the delicious cookies. Mayonnaise. Really? Never would have guessed. Well, I will definitely give Marshall a kiss for you. Okay. Take care.",127,3806
3806,1,15,Marshall ,"Oh, crap. My mom sent cookies?",128,3807
3807,1,15,Lily ,"Yeah. I wish we had a dog, so they wouldn't go to waste.",129,3808
3808,1,15,Marshall ,So we've got the whole place to ourselves.,130,3809
3809,1,15,Lily ,I'm thinking floor s*x.,131,3810

3811,1,15,Lily ,"Ooh, floor's cold. Grab that afghan your mom made.",133,3812
3812,1,15,Robin ,The whole time?,134,3813
3813,1,15,Lily ,The... whole... time.,135,3814
3814,1,15,Marshall ,"Barney, that was really embarrassing for both of us. We just earned a huge chunk of story.",136,3815
3815,1,15,Barney ,"Right. So where was I? Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad.",137,3816
3816,1,15,Barney ,"How can... With your dad? I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!",138,3817
3817,1,15,Shannon ,"Barney, that's not my dad. His name's Greg. I've been seeing him for a few weeks. I was hoping you'd just leave, and we could avoid all this.",139,3818
3818,1,15,Barney ,We're breaking up? But what about the Peace Corps?,140,3819
3819,1,15,Shannon ,"Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase. Greg's older. He's successful. He buys me all this cool stuff.",141,3820
3820,1,15,Barney ,But I love you.,142,3821
3821,1,15,Shannon ,But he has a boat. You should go to the Peace Corps and forget about me.,143,3822
3822,1,15,Barney ,"I didn't go. That night, I recorded my video and mailed it to Shannon. I didn't see her until a week later. There's sugar in the basket. Shannon! Shannon, you came back!",144,3823
3823,1,15,Shannon ,I'm just picking up my last paycheck.,145,3824
3824,1,15,Barney ,Oh. Did you... did you get my tape?,146,3825
3825,1,15,Man ,"Oh, she got the tape.",147,3826
3826,1,15,Barney ,You? It was you?,148,3827
3827,1,15,Man ,"Will I ever see another rainbow Oh, man.",149,3828
3828,1,15,Lily ,"Oh, you poor thing.",150,3829
3829,1,15,Barney ,The story's not over. I did see Shannon one more time.,151,3830
3830,1,15,Robin ,When?,152,3831
3831,1,15,Marshall ,Sorry.,153,3832
3832,1,15,Lily ,You've got to tell us.,154,3833
3833,1,15,Barney ,"I don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it.",155,3834
3834,1,15,Ted ,Fine. Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...,156,3835
3835,1,15,Barney ,"Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear. Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth. Why can't you?",157,3836
3836,1,15,Ted ,"You're right. Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet, but a while back, I was kind of into Robin. In fact, on our first date, I might have said, ""I love you."" Understandably, she freaked out and I left. But unfortunately, the night did not end there.",158,3837
3837,1,15,Ted ,We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit.,159,3838
3838,1,15,Ranjit ,To one hell of a night!,160,3839
3839,1,15,Ted ,"And I drank... a lot. So you guys think I should have kissed her? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now.",161,3840
3840,1,15,Barney ,Yes! Do it!,162,3841
3841,1,15,Ranjit ,To the cab.,163,3842
3842,1,15,Robin ,Hello? Is someone out there?,164,3843
3843,1,15,Lily ,You ralphed and ran?,165,3844
3844,1,15,Marshall ,I thought you were vomit-free since '93. So that was a lie?,166,3845
3845,1,15,Robin ,You re-returned for me. That's really sweet. Though you kind of ruined my customized Scherbotsky doormat.,167,3846
3846,1,15,Ted ,Sorry.,168,3847
3847,1,15,Robin ,It's okay.,169,3848
3848,1,15,Ted ,"Victoria, I know this must be...",170,3849
3849,1,15,Victoria ,Yeah. It kind of is.,171,3850
3850,1,15,Barney ,"Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story. But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine. We fast-forward eight years into the future.",172,3851
3851,1,15,Marshall ,"Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year.",173,3852
3852,1,15,Barney ,"Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight.",174,3853
3853,1,15,Barney ,Hi.,175,3854
3854,1,15,Shannon ,Barney?,176,3855
3855,1,15,Barney ,"Hi, Shannon.",177,3856
3856,1,15,Shannon ,What are you doing here?,178,3857
3857,1,15,Barney ,"Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life.",179,3858
3858,1,15,Barney ,"She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker: Shannon's a mom. She has a little kid named Max. That's crazy. That could have been my kid. But instead, what do I have? My whole life's some money in the bank, some suits in my closet and a string of one-night stands.",180,3859
3859,1,15,Lily ,"Hey. Come on. I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another, it doesn't make your life any worse.",181,3860
3860,1,15,Barney ,"My life rocks! Money, suits and s*x. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.",182,3861
3861,1,15,Lily ,Nope.,183,3862
3862,1,15,Barney ,Yeah.,184,3863
3863,1,15,Lily ,Nope.,185,3864
3864,1,15,Barney ,Yeah.,186,3865
3865,1,15,Lily ,"Sorry. Don't buy it. You're making it up. You're just trying to cover the fact that you actually had a profound moment of doubt about yourself and... Oh, my God.",187,3866
3866,1,15,Shannon ,"Oh, Barney!",188,3867
3867,1,15,Barney ,"Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?",189,3868
3868,1,15,Shannon ,Is your phone on?,190,3869
3869,1,15,Barney ,"Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down.",191,3870
3870,1,15,Lily ,"Ew, gross. Just stop it.",192,3871
3871,1,15,Barney ,"Ladies, gentlemen... Ted. This has been a wonderful evening. I got great dirt on all you guys. I got Ted to tell the re-return. I finally nailed Shannon! Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right. And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is. Peace out, hombres!",193,3872
3872,1,15,Marshall ,I think Barney just won game night.,194,3873
3873,1,15,,"Ted from 2030: We spend so much effort trying to keep parts of our lives hidden even from our closest friends. But those rare times when we do open up, it's amazing how minor those secrets all end up seeming. Of course, not every secret was told that night. But that's getting ahead of the story.",195,3874
3874,1,16,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when it comes to love, the best relationships are the ones that just come naturally.",1,3875
3875,1,16,Ted ,My first solo batch.,2,3876
3876,1,16,Victoria ,"Um, I think those need to stay in the oven a while longer. Here's a professional tip. If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake. It's a beverage.",3,3877
3877,1,16,,"Ted from 2030: Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun, and easy, and uncomplicated. It was pretty great.",4,3878
3878,1,16,Barney ,"Um, are you coloring in your butt?",5,3879
3879,1,16,Marshall ,"I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.",6,3880
3880,1,16,Barney ,So wear another one.,7,3881
3881,1,16,Marshall ,I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.,8,3882
3882,1,16,Barney ,"Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door.",9,3883
3883,1,16,Marshall ,"Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world.",10,3884
3884,1,16,Barney ,"Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.",11,3885
3885,1,16,Marshall ,"A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding.",12,3886
3886,1,16,Barney ,"Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks ""suit."" Tomorrow, noon, my tailor.",13,3887
3887,1,16,Marshall ,"No thanks, dude. (Barney grabs Marshall's pants and tears them apart) Noon?",14,3888
3888,1,16,Barney ,Noon. See you then.,15,3889
3889,1,16,Victoria ,"Hey, girls.",16,3890
3890,1,16,Robin and Lily, Hey.,17,3891
3891,1,16,Victoria ,"Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted. It's our two monthiversary, so we're going out to dinner.",18,3892
3892,1,16,Robin ,"Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask.",19,3893
3893,1,16,Lily ,Robin!,20,3894
3894,1,16,Robin ,"Oh, come on. We bust on each other. We're just at that place in our strong friendship.",21,3895
3895,1,16,Victoria ,Really? Oh.,22,3896
3896,1,16,Robin ,"Get off me. Oh, see? I did it again.",23,3897
3897,1,16,Victoria ,"What are you guys up to? Oh, dress shopping. You know, I make wedding cakes for a lot of fancy bridal shops. If you want, I could take you shopping, maybe get you a discount.",24,3898
3898,1,16,Lily ,Really? That'd be great.,25,3899
3899,1,16,Victoria ,Yeah. Huh. I should take this. Hello.,26,3900
3900,1,16,Robin ,"Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster?",27,3901
3901,1,16,Lily ,"Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them?",28,3902
3902,1,16,Robin ,The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.,29,3903
3903,1,16,Lily ,"Sold. Victoria, what's wrong?",30,3904
3904,1,16,Victoria ,I've just been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany.,31,3905
3905,1,16,Ted ,"Wait. Germany, Europe?",32,3906
3906,1,16,Victoria ,"It's for two years. I figured I didn't have much of a chance, 'cause they don't let many Americans in, but... I'm in.",33,3907
3907,1,16,Ted ,"So, this is the Europe Germany?",34,3908
3908,1,16,Victoria ,What other Germany would it be?,35,3909
3909,1,16,Ted ,The one in Epcot?,36,3910
3910,1,16,Victoria ,Ted.,37,3911
3911,1,16,Ted ,Sorry. Congratulations.,38,3912
3912,1,16,Victoria ,Thank you. I don't know if I'm going to go.,39,3913
3913,1,16,Ted ,"Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?",40,3914
3914,1,16,Victoria ,I don't know. I just... I don't think that long distance really works for anyone.,41,3915
3915,1,16,Ted ,"Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.",42,3916
3916,1,16,Victoria ,"So, that leaves us with...",43,3917
3917,1,16,Ted ,"Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel...",44,3918
3918,1,16,Victoria ,I have to leave on Monday.,45,3919
3919,1,16,Ted ,"Monday, September the...?",46,3920
3920,1,16,Victoria ,Ted. Do you have any thoughts?,47,3921
3921,1,16,Ted ,Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want. We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.,48,3922
3922,1,16,Victoria ,It's a date.,49,3923
3923,1,16,,Ted from 2030: And that's when things got complicated.,50,3924
3924,1,16,Marshall ,"Hey, baby, how's the dress place?",51,3925
3925,1,16,Lily ,Everything's so fluffy and white. It's like shopping in a marshmallow. How's Barney's tailor?,52,3926
3926,1,16,Marshall ,"Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.",53,3927
3927,1,16,Lily ,"Well, good luck, baby.",54,3928
3928,1,16,Marshall ,"Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?",55,3929
3929,1,16,Barney ,"Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process.",56,3930
3930,1,16,Marshall ,You speak Ukrainian?,57,3931
3931,1,16,Ted ,"Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option.",58,3932
3932,1,16,Marshall ,"No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no s*x. k*ll me now.",59,3933
3933,1,16,Barney ,Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.,60,3934
3934,1,16,Ted ,Really? You?,61,3935
3935,1,16,Barney ,"Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.",62,3936
3936,1,16,Marshall ,"Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?",63,3937
3937,1,16,Ted ,Yeah.,64,3938
3938,1,16,Marshall ,"Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, ""You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face."" Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am.",65,3939
3939,1,16,Ted ,"Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point?",66,3940
3940,1,16,Marshall ,"Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost k*lled us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay.",67,3941
3941,1,16,Ted ,"Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.",68,3942
3942,1,16,Marshall ,"Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.",69,3943
3943,1,16,Ted ,"Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.",70,3944
3944,1,16,Barney ,Are you sure?,71,3945
3945,1,16,Ted ,All right. (He calls Victoria),72,3946
3946,1,16,Victoria ,Hello.,73,3947
3947,1,16,Ted ,"Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?",74,3948
3948,1,16,Victoria ,"Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.",75,3949
3949,1,16,Ted ,"Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye. (He hungs up) She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all.",76,3950
3950,1,16,Barney ,"Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.",77,3951
3951,1,16,Marshall ,"Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?",78,3952
3952,1,16,Barney ,Here. Play with this pin cushion.,79,3953
3953,1,16,Marshall ,God. I'm going to look hot.,80,3954
3954,1,16,Barney ,"Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.",81,3955
3955,1,16,Marshall ,No way. The Kid does not sell out.,82,3956
3956,1,16,Barney ,"Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.",83,3957
3957,1,16,Marshall ,No. I've made my decision.,84,3958
3958,1,16,Ted ,"So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go.",85,3959
3959,1,16,,Ted from 2030: And so I met her that night to tell her my decision.,86,3960
3960,1,16,Victoria ,"All right, I've been thinking a lot about this... Okay, wait, before you say anything, I wanted to give you this. This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking.",87,3961
3961,1,16,Ted ,I want you to stay.,88,3962
3962,1,16,Marshall ,Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.,89,3963
3963,1,16,Lily ,"Oh, good luck, baby.",90,3964
3964,1,16,Marshall ,Bye.,91,3965
3965,1,16,Woman ,"Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear?",92,3966
3966,1,16,Lily ,Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.,93,3967
3967,1,16,Robin ,I saw a couple up front that were nice.,94,3968
3968,1,16,Lily ,Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.,95,3969
3969,1,16,Victoria ,"Oh, these women are experts. They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear.",96,3970
3970,1,16,Lily ,Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!,97,3971
3971,1,16,Victoria ,At least we get free champagne!,98,3972
3972,1,16,Robin ,And cake.,99,3973
3973,1,16,Victoria ,Mm-hmm.,100,3974
3974,1,16,Robin ,"Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?",101,3975
3975,1,16,Victoria ,"You know, I don't know. I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted. I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works.",102,3976
3976,1,16,Lily ,Ugh. All talking and no s*x. k*ll me now.,103,3977
3977,1,16,Victoria ,"I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One. That's pretty hard to walk away from.",104,3978
3978,1,16,Robin ,"Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months.",105,3979
3979,1,16,Victoria ,But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted. He's amazing. He's the best guy I know.,106,3980
3980,1,16,Robin ,"Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.",107,3981
3981,1,16,Victoria ,I really don't...,108,3982
3982,1,16,Robin ,"s*x. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This b*st*rd's kicked.",109,3983
3983,1,16,Woman ,Thanks.,110,3984
3984,1,16,Victoria and Robin, Oh!,111,3985
3985,1,16,Lily ,"It's okay, guys, I hate it.",112,3986
3986,1,16,Victoria ,Just horrible.,113,3987
3987,1,16,Robin ,"It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses.",114,3988
3988,1,16,Lily ,"You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.",115,3989
3989,1,16,Victoria ,But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates? It's too soon. Ooh. Speak of the devil. Hello.,116,3990
3990,1,16,Ted ,"Hey, random question: how do you feel cats?",117,3991
3991,1,16,Victoria ,"Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.",118,3992
3992,1,16,Robin ,A cat person. Why am I not surprised?,119,3993
3993,1,16,Victoria ,Bye. Why does Ted want to know if I like cats?,120,3994
3994,1,16,Lily ,Maybe he's going to buy you one.,121,3995
3995,1,16,Victoria ,I did hear barking in the background. Maybe he was in a pet store. Does he want us to get a cat together?,122,3996
3996,1,16,Robin ,Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.,123,3997
3997,1,16,Victoria ,That is low. Do you really think that's what he's doing?,124,3998
3998,1,16,Robin ,"Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany.",125,3999
3999,1,16,Victoria and Robin, Aw.,126,4000
4000,1,16,Lily ,"Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.",127,4001
4001,1,16,Robin ,"Ugly, ugly, ugly.",128,4002
4002,1,16,Victoria ,"I don't know what to say. You know what? We're doing this all wrong. I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun.",129,4003
4003,1,16,Lily ,Are you okay?,130,4004
4004,1,16,Robin ,I'm fine.,131,4005
4005,1,16,Lily ,Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.,132,4006
4006,1,16,Robin ,"I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship.",133,4007
4007,1,16,Lily ,"Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.",134,4008
4008,1,16,Victoria ,"Somebody say ""beautiful princess.""",135,4009
4009,1,16,Lily ,"Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.",136,4010
4010,1,16,Victoria ,"Oh, look how happy she is. You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women who would never let any guy mess with my career. And now I'm actually thinking about it. I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something.",137,4011
4011,1,16,Robin ,I know what you mean.,138,4012
4012,1,16,Victoria ,You do?,139,4013
4013,1,16,Lily ,"Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.",140,4014
4014,1,16,Victoria ,"See, that's what I'm afraid of.",141,4015
4015,1,16,Robin ,Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.,142,4016
4016,1,16,Victoria ,Robin... I think that you are the coolest. I'm so glad that we're friends.,143,4017
4017,1,16,Robin ,"Oh, no way... you're the coolest.",144,4018
4018,1,16,Victoria ,"No, you are.",145,4019
4019,1,16,Robin ,"Okay, I am.",146,4020
4020,1,16,Victoria ,I'm going to stay.,147,4021
4021,1,16,Victoria and Robin, Aw.,148,4022
4022,1,16,Lily ,"Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.",149,4023
4023,1,16,Robin ,"Wow, you look incredible.",150,4024
4024,1,16,Lily ,"Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?",151,4025
4025,1,16,Robin ,"Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.",152,4026
4026,1,16,Lily ,"Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married. (She sits on the cake, without noticing it) Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?",153,4027
4027,1,16,Robin ,"Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake.",154,4028
4028,1,16,Victoria ,"But, you know what? It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry.",155,4029
4029,1,16,Robin ,"Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.",156,4030
4030,1,16,Lily ,It was like this when I found it?,157,4031
4031,1,16,Woman ,And how will you be paying for this?,158,4032
4032,1,16,Lily ,Credit card... s.,159,4033
4033,1,16,Victoria ,"I wanted to give you... this. This is what happens when you... you know, let them finish baking.",160,4034
4034,1,16,Ted ,I want you to stay.,161,4035
4035,1,16,Victoria ,I have to go to Germany.,162,4036
4036,1,16,Ted ,You're going?,163,4037
4037,1,16,Victoria ,Yes. I have to.,164,4038
4038,1,16,Ted ,So that's what you decided?,165,4039
4039,1,16,Victoria ,"Well, no... I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying, but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go.",166,4040
4040,1,16,Ted ,"What is this, opposite day or something?",167,4041
4041,1,16,Victoria ,No.,168,4042
4042,1,16,Ted ,So it is?,169,4043

4044,1,16,Ted ,"I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are.",171,4045
4045,1,16,Victoria ,"Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me?",172,4046
4046,1,16,Ted ,"Well, that's just crazy.",173,4047
4047,1,16,Victoria ,"Oh, okay. So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy.",174,4048
4048,1,16,Ted ,But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.,175,4049
4049,1,16,Victoria ,You'd have me.,176,4050
4050,1,16,Ted ,"We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this.",177,4051
4051,1,16,Victoria ,So... we're breaking up?,178,4052
4052,1,16,Ted ,I guess so. I guess so.,179,4053
4053,1,16,Marshall ,"God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.",180,4054
4054,1,16,Ted ,"It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.",181,4055
4055,1,16,Marshall ,"Well, thank you for acknowledging it. It was weird that you hadn't. Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?",182,4056
4056,1,16,Ted ,She's leaving tomorrow.,183,4057

4058,1,16,Ted ,"Yeah, she... she's still in town.",185,4059
4059,1,16,Marshall ,"Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together. Ted, think about it this way: if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow, would you sit on the couch and cry about it, or would you run, and jump, and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?",186,4060
4060,1,16,Ted ,"Awesome air kicks, huh?",187,4061
4061,1,16,Marshall ,New pajama bottoms?,188,4062
4062,1,16,Ted ,You know it.,189,4063
4063,1,16,Ted ,"So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.",190,4064
4064,1,16,Victoria ,"Wait, so we're sharing the leg?",191,4065
4065,1,16,Ted ,"No, the leg is a metaphor.",192,4066
4066,1,16,Victoria ,"How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day, and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next? I don't know, Ted.",193,4067
4067,1,16,Ted ,"Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?",194,4068
4068,1,16,Victoria ,"Well, what would you want to do?",195,4069
4069,1,16,Ted ,Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.,196,4070
4070,1,16,Victoria ,Like go to the Mets.,197,4071
4071,1,16,Ted ,"Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.",198,4072
4072,1,16,Victoria ,See some monkeys at the zoo?,199,4073
4073,1,16,Ted ,Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?,200,4074
4074,1,16,Victoria ,Wow! We better get going.,201,4075
4075,1,16,Ted ,"Yeah, big day.",202,4076
4076,1,16,Victoria ,Yeah.,203,4077

4079,1,16,Lily ,"No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.",206,4080
4080,1,16,Robin ,"Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.",207,4081
4081,1,16,Lily ,"Yeah, but only, like, second base.",208,4082
4082,1,16,Barney ,"Look at us: two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash.",209,4083
4083,1,16,Marshall ,"Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.",210,4084
4084,1,16,Barney ,"So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?",211,4085
4085,1,16,Marshall ,"Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp.",212,4086
4086,1,16,Barney ,"Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.",213,4087
4087,1,16,Marshall ,"B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price.",214,4088
4088,1,16,Barney ,"Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.",215,4089
4089,1,16,Marshall ,You set this up! You set this whole thing up!,216,4090
4090,1,16,Barney ,I most certainly did...,217,4091
4091,1,16,Marshall ,"Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise.",218,4092
4092,1,16,Lily ,"I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.",219,4093
4093,1,16,Marshall ,What time is the interview?,220,4094

4100,1,16,Ted ,Even if we're not.,227,4101
4101,1,16,Victoria ,Okay.,228,4102
4102,1,16,Ted ,"Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?",229,4103

It was written by an anthropologist named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez, it told the story of the year she spent living among the Western Lowland Gorillas of Cameroon. When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez came to the local community college to give a lecture, Marshall, the youngest member of the audience, raised his hand with a question.",1,4109

4235,1,17,Lily ,"Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational.",128,4236
4236,1,17,Marshall ,"Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled, but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas. I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them. It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool?",129,4237
4237,1,17,Lily ,It sounds kinda like peer pressure.,130,4238

4437,1,18,Ted ,"Marshall, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen.",106,4438
4438,1,18,Marshall ,"Ted, what does your mom always say?",107,4439
4439,1,18,Ted ,Nothing good ever...,108,4440
4440,1,18,Marshall ,Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m. Go home! It's too late for juice.,109,4441
4441,1,18,Ted ,"Dude, Robin and I are just friends. She doesn't even like me that way.",110,4442
4442,1,18,Lily ,"Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.",111,4443
4443,1,18,Ted ,What?,112,4444
4444,1,18,Lily ,"It's a big secret, so don't tell her I told you, but she's very vulnerable right now and you have a girlfriend. Go home, Ted.",113,4445
4445,1,18,Ted ,She-she likes me?,114,4446
4446,1,18,Lily ,"Yes. So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there. Go home, Ted.",115,4447
4447,1,18,Ted ,She likes me?,116,4448
4448,1,18,Lily ,"Go home, Ted.",117,4449
4449,1,18,Ted ,"Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home.",118,4450
4450,1,18,Lily ,Good. He's going home.,119,4451
4451,1,18,Marshall ,He is so not going home. I cannot believe you just told him that.,120,4452
4452,1,18,Lily ,What do you mean?,121,4453
4453,1,18,Marshall ,"Lily, here's what you just said: ""Ted, whatever you do, don't go up there. There's a beautiful girl who wants to have s*x with you. And then she's gonna make you some delicious juice.""",122,4454
4454,1,18,Lily ,"No, he's not going up there. He has more sense than that.",123,4455
4455,1,18,,Ted from 2030: I did have more sense than that.,124,4456
4456,1,18,Ted ,Keep the change.,125,4457
4457,1,18,Cab driver, Thanks.,126,4458
4458,1,18,,"Ted from 2030: But after 2:00 a.m, my good sense was sound asleep.",127,4459
4459,1,18,Victoria ,So you're doing this? You're going up there?,128,4460
4460,1,18,Ted ,You want to get out of the way?,129,4461
4461,1,18,Victoria ,I'm not in the way.,130,4462
4462,1,18,Ted ,"You know, if you had just called me, I...",131,4463
4463,1,18,Robin ,Hi.,132,4464
4464,1,18,Ted ,"Hi. Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets.",133,4465
4465,1,18,Robin ,Or we could just drink wine.,134,4466
4466,1,18,Ted ,"Wine... not? Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said.",135,4467
4467,1,18,Robin ,Thanks.,136,4468
4468,1,18,Ted ,Make it a big glass.,137,4469
4469,1,18,Robin ,Sure.,138,4470
4470,1,18,Ted ,"So, how's it hanging?",139,4471
4471,1,18,Robin ,Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore or what the hell you're doing with your life? Do you ever have one of those days?,140,4472
4472,1,18,Ted ,"Uh, about once a week.",141,4473
4473,1,18,Robin ,"I don't know, it was just a, a rough day and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you. So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?",142,4474
4474,1,18,,"Ted from 2030: When the clock strikes 2:00, just go to sleep.",143,4475
4475,1,18,Ted ,We broke up.,144,4476
4476,1,18,Robin ,What?,145,4477
4477,1,18,Ted ,"Yeah. Yeah, she finally called. We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is-- and then... she dumped me.",146,4478
4478,1,18,Robin ,"Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful.",147,4479
4479,1,18,Ted ,You're smiling.,148,4480
4480,1,18,Robin ,"Am I? No I'm not. I'm a news anchor. Smiling's a part of the job. Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today. See? You're smiling, too.",149,4481
4481,1,18,Ted ,Yeah. I have no idea what that's all about.,150,4482
4482,1,18,Marshall ,How much does Korean Elvis rock? I'll answer that. Infinity. He rocks... infinity.,151,4483
4483,1,18,Lily ,"Okay, it's time for bed.",152,4484
4484,1,18,Barney ,What? No. It's 2:30.,153,4485
4485,1,18,Lily ,Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.,154,4486
4486,1,18,Barney ,"You know, I have found, in my travels... that all the best things in life happen after 2:00 a.m. When I look back at the best stories of my life-- the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy, the almost four-way.",155,4487
4487,1,18,Marshall ,You never had a four-way.,156,4488
4488,1,18,Barney ,"I said ""almost."" All those things happened after 2:00 a.m. because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary.",157,4489
4489,1,18,Lily ,We're going home.,158,4490
4490,1,18,Barney ,"What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?",159,4491
4491,1,18,Korean Elvis, Rock 'n' roll.,160,4492
4492,1,18,Barney ,And it begins.,161,4493
4493,1,18,Ted ,"So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look.",162,4494
4494,1,18,Robin ,"Oh, yeah. Do you like it?",163,4495
4495,1,18,Ted ,"Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right.",164,4496
4496,1,18,Robin ,Wow. Weird.,165,4497
4497,1,18,Ted ,"Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this.",166,4498
4498,1,18,Robin ,I'll be here.,167,4499
4499,1,18,Ted ,Hello?,168,4500
4500,1,18,Korean Elvis," Ted, this is your main man, K.E. I want you to shake your tail feathers down here ASAP, you dig?",169,4501
4501,1,18,Marshall ,Sorry about that.,170,4502
4502,1,18,Ted ,Was that Korean Elvis?,171,4503
4503,1,18,Marshall ,"I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's.",172,4504
4504,1,18,Ted ,"Um... Actually... I'm at Robin's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.",173,4505
4505,1,18,Marshall ,"Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis, but what the bleep are you doing, dude?",174,4506
4506,1,18,Ted ,"What do you expect from me? It's Robin. Victoria's great, but, it's Robin. I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria.",175,4507
4507,1,18,Lily ,Gonna?,176,4508
4508,1,18,Ted ,Yes. First thing tomorrow.,177,4509
4509,1,18,Lily ,"Okay, but, but, as of right now at-at... 2:45 a.m. you still have a girlfriend. Ted, I love you. I love Robin. But if you do this right now, your entire future with her will be built on a crime. Just go home, Ted. Don't do this the wrong way.",178,4510
4510,1,18,Ted ,I hate how you're always right.,179,4511
4511,1,18,Lily ,It's my best and most annoying trait.,180,4512
4512,1,18,Ted ,Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.,181,4513
4513,1,18,Robin ,Hey.,182,4514
4514,1,18,Ted ,I should probably get going. It's pretty late. I'm sorry. I...,183,4515
4515,1,18,Robin ,"Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.",184,4516
4516,1,18,Ted ,Can I call you tomorrow?,185,4517
4517,1,18,Robin ,Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.,186,4518
4518,1,18,Ted ,"Okay. Good night, Robin.",187,4519
4519,1,18,Robin ,"Good night, Ted.",188,4520
4520,1,18,Robin ,"Oh, my God. We're making out.",189,4521
4521,1,18,Ted ,Right.,190,4522
4522,1,18,Robin ,This is crazy.,191,4523
4523,1,18,Ted ,Right? Right?,192,4524
4524,1,18,Robin ,"Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...",193,4525
4525,1,18,Ted ,Yeah.,194,4526
4526,1,18,Robin ,Yeah?,195,4527
4527,1,18,Ted ,"Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.",196,4528
4528,1,18,Robin ,Okay.,197,4529
4529,1,18,Ted ,Stop doing that.,198,4530
4530,1,18,Victoria ,Whatcha doin'?,199,4531
4531,1,18,Ted ,"I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.",200,4532
4532,1,18,Victoria ,"Okay. Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be? Length of an average pee? No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes. Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive...",201,4533
4533,1,18,Ted ,What do you want from me? People break up. It happens.,202,4534
4534,1,18,Victoria ,Not like this. Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with.,203,4535
4535,1,18,Ted ,It's not ideal.,204,4536
4536,1,18,,"Ted from 2030: Meanwhile, back at the bar, Barney was still trying to prove that good things can happen after 2:00 a.m.",205,4537
4537,1,18,Barney ,"Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?",206,4538
4538,1,18,Lily ,I think he just spat on me.,207,4539
4539,1,18,Marshall ,"Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going.",208,4540
4540,1,18,Barney ,"No! No, come on.",209,4541
4541,1,18,Marshall ,Yes!,210,4542
4542,1,18,Barney ,"Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the ""le"". We still got the ""gen."" The ""da."" The ""ry.""",211,4543
4543,1,18,Lily ,"Okay, if we're at the ""le,"" then I say we follow it up with a ""t's go home.""",212,4544
4544,1,18,Marshall ,"Oh, wow, you just got burned, phonics style.",213,4545
4545,1,18,Korean Elvis," No, no, no, no, no. Baby, baby, baby, don't go. Just one dance, huh?",214,4546
4546,1,18,Lily ,"Okay, seriously.",215,4547
4547,1,18,Korean Elvis," Hey, I know what you like.",216,4548
4548,1,18,,"Ted from 2030: And so, Barney was right-- the night was legendary. It would come to be known as The Time Lily Kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards.",217,4549
4549,1,18,Marshall ,"Hey, you guys remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards?",218,4550
4550,1,18,Ted ,You're right. I owe you a real breakup call. I'll call you tomorrow.,219,4551
4551,1,18,Victoria ,Good. So you're gonna go home?,220,4552
4552,1,18,Ted ,"Why should I have to go home? You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry.",221,4553
4553,1,18,Victoria ,Ted.,222,4554
4554,1,18,Ted ,"It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the g*n by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Robin. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay.",223,4555
4555,1,18,Victoria ,"Oh, please. You just want to get laid.",224,4556
4556,1,18,Ted ,"Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night.",225,4557
4557,1,18,Victoria ,That's not your phone.,226,4558
4558,1,18,Ted ,This isn't my phone.,227,4559
4559,1,18,Robin ,"Okay. Bye. (She hungs up) I thought it was mine, so I answered it.",228,4560
4560,1,18,Ted ,Was it...?,229,4561
4561,1,18,Robin ,It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.,230,4562
4562,1,18,,"Ted from 2030: I called Victoria from the cab and we broke up. Yes... And there you have it, kids. The stupidest thing I've ever done. In one night, I managed to hurt two people I cared about. And none of it would've happened if I just listened to my mom. So I guess if there's a lesson to be learned here, it's this: when it's 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep.",231,4563
4563,1,19,Ted ,"Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set? Disc three. My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone? Come on. Disc three! God, Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours.",1,4564
4564,1,19,Lily ,"What do you mean ""could""?",2,4565
4565,1,19,Ted ,"I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.",3,4566
4566,1,19,Barney ,"Trust that impulse, Ted.",4,4567
4567,1,19,Robin ,"Hey. Something kind of cool just happened. My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award.",5,4568
4568,1,19,Lily ,A... LAME-A?,6,4569
4569,1,19,Robin ,"We prefer Local Area Media Award. Um... there's going to be this big banquet. I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came. And there's an open bar.",7,4570
4570,1,19,All ,Yes! Word up!,8,4571
4571,1,19,Ted ,"Yeah, put me down for two.",9,4572
4572,1,19,Robin ,Really? It's three months away.,10,4573
4573,1,19,Ted ,"I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time.",11,4574
4574,1,19,Ted ,I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.,12,4575
4575,1,19,Barney ,You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?,13,4576
4576,1,19,Ted ,"Yes, that's what I meant by ""you know."" I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls. Look, I shouldn't go.",14,4577
4577,1,19,Marshall ,"You should definitely go. Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her.",15,4578
4578,1,19,Barney ,"Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs.",16,4579
4579,1,19,Ted ,That's only two.,17,4580
4580,1,19,Barney ,Count again.,18,4581
4581,1,19,Ted ,"Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours.",19,4582
4582,1,19,Barney ,So get an escort.,20,4583
4583,1,19,Ted ,"By ""escort,"" you mean prostitute?",21,4584
4584,1,19,Barney ,Why not?,22,4585
4585,1,19,Ted ,Because... gross?,23,4586
4586,1,19,Barney ,"Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.",24,4587
4587,1,19,Marshall ,You really think that's true?,25,4588
4588,1,19,Barney ,"Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out.",26,4589
4589,1,19,Marshall ,"Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen. Kaboom! You've been lawyered.",27,4590
4590,1,19,Barney ,"Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun.",28,4591
4591,1,19,Ted ,"Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have s*x with?",29,4592
4592,1,19,Barney ,Yes.,30,4593
4593,1,19,Ted ,No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?,31,4594
4594,1,19,Barney ,"That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.",32,4595
4595,1,19,Marshall ,You just made that up.,33,4596
4596,1,19,Barney ,Withdrawn.,34,4597
4597,1,19,Marshall ,"Lawyered. The point is, how long has it been?",35,4598
4598,1,19,Ted ,57 days.,36,4599
4599,1,19,Barney ,Is that your water? May I?,37,4600
4600,1,19,Ted ,"Yeah, go ahead.",38,4601
4601,1,19,Barney ,"Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump.",39,4602
4602,1,19,Ted ,"No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.",40,4603
4603,1,19,Barney ,"Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool.",41,4604
4604,1,19,Ted ,"Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp.",42,4605
4605,1,19,Barney ,You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic? That's racism. And I do not drink with racists. Good day.,43,4606
4606,1,19,Ted ,"You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can...",44,4607
4607,1,19,Barney ,I said good day!,45,4608
4608,1,19,Robin ,So should I wear my hair up or down? Lily.,46,4609
4609,1,19,Lily ,What?,47,4610
4610,1,19,Robin ,You okay?,48,4611
4611,1,19,Lily ,"Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm just exhausted from work. The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day. It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap.",49,4612
4612,1,19,Robin ,"Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were? Is that safe?",50,4613
4613,1,19,Lily ,"Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me?",51,4614
4614,1,19,Robin ,"Ted's still coming to this thing, right?",52,4615
4615,1,19,Lily ,Yep.,53,4616
4616,1,19,Robin ,"Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?",54,4617
4617,1,19,Lily ,"Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous.",55,4618
4618,1,19,Robin ,"No, it's just this guy at the station. I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes. Is it going to be weird?",56,4619
4619,1,19,Lily ,"No, it's not going to be weird at all. (Lily's on the phone with Marshall) Robin's bringing a date.",57,4620
4620,1,19,Marshall ,Boy. That's going to be really weird.,58,4621
4621,1,19,Lily ,I know.,59,4622
4622,1,19,Marshall ,Robin's bringing a date.,60,4623
4623,1,19,Ted ,Oh. Okay. That's not weird. She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on.,61,4624
4624,1,19,Marshall ,"Dude, it's going to be weird.",62,4625
4625,1,19,Ted ,"No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird.",63,4626
4626,1,19,Barney ,"Yeah, it won't be weird.",64,4627
4627,1,19,Ted ,Thank you.,65,4628
4628,1,19,Barney ,Because you're going to bring your own date.,66,4629
4629,1,19,Woman ,"Hello, Barney.",67,4630
4630,1,19,Barney ,"Hi, Mary. Have you met Ted?",68,4631
4631,1,19,Mary ,Nice to meet you Ted.,69,4632
4632,1,19,Ted ,"Hi, Mary. Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too.",70,4633
4633,1,19,Mary ,So we're going to an award show?,71,4634
4634,1,19,Ted ,"Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Barney.",72,4635
4635,1,19,Barney ,"See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable.",73,4636

4735,1,19,Mary ,Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room.,173,4736
4736,1,19,Barney ,"Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts. Actually, don't use the mini-bar. Do it. Come on, Ted, do it. This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.",174,4737

4776,1,19,Lily ,"You know, Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low, but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle. Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah!",214,4777

4784,1,19,Barney ,"No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.",222,4785

4811,1,19,Ted ,What point?,249,4812
4812,1,19,Barney ,"Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date. All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet and your slump is over.",250,4813
4813,1,19,Ted ,"So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?",251,4814

4819,1,19,Barney ,Your room?,257,4820
4820,1,19,Ted ,"Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card-- never checked out. By the way, you know what's super fun? Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain. Well, it's almost 3:00. Got a massage. Toodles.",258,4821

4840,1,20,Robin ,What?,19,4841
4841,1,20,Marshall ,You're a wonder.,20,4842
4842,1,20,Ted ,Wow! You guys are getting married in two months.,21,4843
4843,1,20,Robin ,How are you going to get everything done?,22,4844
4844,1,20,Lily ,"Division of labor. Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up. Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist.",23,4845
4845,1,20,,Ted from 2030: Robin had been mad at me since the night I slightly exaggerated my not-having-a-girlfriend-ness.,24,4846
4846,1,20,Ted ,Was it...?,25,4847
4847,1,20,Robin ,It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.,26,4848
4848,1,20,Lily ,"Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist? And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations.",27,4849
4849,1,20,Marshall ,"Wow. That was really awkward, Lil. And still. It's still really awkward right now.",28,4850
4850,1,20,Barney ,"Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?",29,4851
4851,1,20,Lily ,"Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me.",30,4852
4852,1,20,Barney ,"Lil, you know I can't promise that.",31,4853
4853,1,20,Marshall ,"Shh! Shh! Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out. Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad.",32,4854
4854,1,20,Lily ,Crap! Band! We forgot a band! It's just gonna be silence and then people chewing.,33,4855
4855,1,20,Marshall ,"Shh! Shh! Baby, don't worry about it. I called The 88!",34,4856
4856,1,20,Lily ,Who?,35,4857
4857,1,20,Marshall ,The 88. They're this awesome band. They played my law review party. They were found guilty. On three counts of rocking.,36,4858
4858,1,20,Ted ,"I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding, they were great.",37,4859
4859,1,20,Lily ,"John ""Bonzo"" Bonham from Led Zeppelin?",38,4860
4860,1,20,Ted ,"Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer from Led Zeppelin, who died in 1980, got married two months ago.",39,4861
4861,1,20,Lily ,"Look, I... I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen. We... we don't even know if they can play our song. They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition.",40,4862
4862,1,20,Marshall ,"Baby, The 88 don't audition. They're, like, the Wiggles of wedding bands.",41,4863
4863,1,20,Lily ,"Well, then... I have to say no.",42,4864
4864,1,20,Marshall ,"Baby, they're only holding the date until Monday.",43,4865
4865,1,20,Lily ,"Well... well, are they playing anywhere this weekend?",44,4866
4866,1,20,Marshall ,Let me check their Website.,45,4867
4867,1,20,Lily ,What?,46,4868
4868,1,20,Ted ,"Lily, you're being a wee bit intense about this band thing.",47,4869
4869,1,20,Lily ,"Intense? I have a wedding to plan in nine weeks for 200 people. Even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt and consume this coffee table, I need you to roll with it, okay?",48,4870
4870,1,20,Ted ,Wow.,49,4871
4871,1,20,Barney ,Guys! I just tasted an amazing caterer.,50,4872
4872,1,20,Lily ,We already have a caterer.,51,4873
4873,1,20,Barney ,"Oh, right. You're getting married. You see what I did there? Took a...",52,4874
4874,1,20,Marshall ,It looks like The 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow.,53,4875
4875,1,20,Lily ,A prom? Can... can we go to that?,54,4876
4876,1,20,Marshall ,"Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch.",55,4877
4877,1,20,Lily ,"Yeah. No, they won't.",56,4878
4878,1,20,Marshall ,Why not?,57,4879
4879,1,20,Lily ,'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.,58,4880
4880,1,20,Barney ,"No sweat, we'll just sneak in.",59,4881
4881,1,20,Marshall ,We're not sneaking in to a high school prom.,60,4882
4882,1,20,Lily ,"Yes, we are. It's the only way.",61,4883
4883,1,20,Ted ,"You're getting on board with Barney's idea? Man, you really have snapped.",62,4884
4884,1,20,Lily ,"It's nine weeks till the wedding. At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything.",63,4885
4885,1,20,Barney ,Well...,64,4886
4886,1,20,Lily ,"No, Barney.",65,4887
4887,1,20,,"Ted from 2030: And so, Aunt Lily had the plan to crash the prom.",66,4888
4888,1,20,Robin ,I'll go with you.,67,4889
4889,1,20,Lily ,Really?,68,4890
4890,1,20,Robin ,Yeah. I never got to go to my prom. We always had field hockey nationals in the spring.,69,4891
4891,1,20,Barney ,Lesbian.,70,4892
4892,1,20,Robin ,"The cough is supposed to cover the ""lesbian.""",71,4893
4893,1,20,Barney ,"No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate.",72,4894
4894,1,20,Lily ,Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?,73,4895
4895,1,20,Barney ,"Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep, and you've got ""statutory"" written all over your body.",74,4896
4896,1,20,Ted ,"Hey, why don't we all go?",75,4897
4897,1,20,Robin ,I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in. We don't want to mess things up for Lily.,76,4898
4898,1,20,Ted ,"Yeah, you're right. Besides, Marshall and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding. Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?",77,4899
4899,1,20,Marshall ,Sounds awesome. We should go out and just get freakin' weird.,78,4900
4900,1,20,Ted ,Yeah.,79,4901
4901,1,20,Marshall ,"'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw.",80,4902
4902,1,20,Barney ,"Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear? Lame! But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later.",81,4903
4903,1,20,Lily ,"All right, what do you think?",82,4904
4904,1,20,Barney ,Horrible.,83,4905
4905,1,20,Lily ,You're gonna make such a great dad.,84,4906
4906,1,20,Barney ,"You look so classy and nice. You're going to stick out like a sore thumb. Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days, with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris? They all dress like strippers. It's go ho or go home.",85,4907
4907,1,20,Lily ,"Well, we have to get in. I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday, 'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have...",86,4908
4908,1,20,Robin ,"Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay? Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it.",87,4909
4909,1,20,Lily ,All right.,88,4910
4910,1,20,Barney ,"That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!",89,4911
4911,1,20,Robin ,"I never thought this would be a bad thing, but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.",90,4912
4912,1,20,Lily ,I didn't know I still had this.,91,4913
4913,1,20,Robin ,What?,92,4914
4914,1,20,Lily ,The dress I wore to my actual prom.,93,4915
4915,1,20,Scooter ,"Dude, you are the hottest girl at this prom, and not like in a corporate, plastic way. Like, truly, truly hot. Like a hot soul.",94,4916
4916,1,20,Lily ,"Aw, you look great, too, Scooter.",95,4917
4917,1,20,Scooter ,So big news. I heard from umpire school. I'm in!,96,4918
4918,1,20,Lily ,"Oh, disco! I am so happy for you.",97,4919
4919,1,20,Scooter ,"You mean happy for us, right, babe?",98,4920
4920,1,20,Lily ,"Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday.",99,4921
4921,1,20,Scooter ,"No, baby. We're gonna be an umpire someday.",100,4922
4922,1,20,Barney ,"Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing.",101,4923
4923,1,20,Robin ,"No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore...",102,4924
4924,1,20,Barney ,Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.,103,4925
4925,1,20,Lily ,Aw. Sweet. Thank you.,104,4926
4926,1,20,Barney ,"Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?",105,4927
4927,1,20,Robin ,"No. I've never been to prom before, okay?",106,4928
4928,1,20,Lily ,We got to go. See ya.,107,4929
4929,1,20,Ted ,"Bye, have fun. See you.",108,4930
4930,1,20,Marshall ,"They grow up into skanks so fast, don't they, Ted?",109,4931
4931,1,20,Ted ,"So, what, we ready for tonight?",110,4932
4932,1,20,Marshall ,Yeah. Just one thing we got to do first.,111,4933
4933,1,20,Ted ,Shot of Jim Beam?,112,4934
4934,1,20,Marshall ,Yeah.,113,4935
4935,1,20,Ted ,Yes!,114,4936
4936,1,20,Marshall ,And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff 200 wedding invitations.,115,4937
4937,1,20,Ted ,What?!,116,4938
4938,1,20,Marshall ,"I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is.",117,4939
4939,1,20,Ted ,"Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break. Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad, but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad.",118,4940
4940,1,20,Marshall ,"Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it. First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize.",119,4941
4941,1,20,Ted ,"Do I look like I'm four? All right, what kind of prize are we talking?",120,4942
4942,1,20,Lily ,"Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids.",121,4943
4943,1,20,Robin ,Is this gonna work?,122,4944
4944,1,20,Lily ,"Yeah. Look, when I was 17, I used to sneak into clubs all the time. It's all about confidence. Follow me. Whee-hoo! Happy prom, everybody. Going to prom-- whee-hoo!",123,4945
4945,1,20,Security guard," Uh, you're adults.",124,4946
4946,1,20,Lily ,"Okay, bye. Okay, look, I just need to see the band. I'm getting married in two months, and...",125,4947
4947,1,20,Security guard, And you're just finding a band?,126,4948
4948,1,20,Barney ,"Hey, ho, hey!",127,4949
4949,1,20,Security guard," I'm sorry, ma'am. You either need to be a student or the date of a student.",128,4950
4950,1,20,Lily ,"Wow. ""Ma'am?"" Check and mate.",129,4951
4951,1,20,Barney ,"It's cool. Time to activate plan B. Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow? Scherbotsky?",130,4952
4952,1,20,Robin ,"Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?",131,4953
4953,1,20,Boy ,We don't have that kind of money.,132,4954
4954,1,20,Robin ,For free.,133,4955
4955,1,20,Boy ,"Oh, hell yeah!",134,4956
4956,1,20,Robin ,"Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily.",135,4957
4957,1,20,Lily ,Hi. Shall we?,136,4958
4958,1,20,Boy ,Sure. I knew it would happen. This is the dream.,137,4959
4959,1,20,Robin ,"Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?",138,4960
4960,1,20,Barney ,Don't worry about me. I'll get in. Oh... I'll get in.,139,4961
4961,1,20,Lily ,We're in!,140,4962
4962,1,20,Singer ,Thank you. We're going to take a break.,141,4963
4963,1,20,Lily ,"Oh, you're kidding me.",142,4964
4964,1,20,,"Boy #1: Hey, uh, you ladies want something to take the edge off?",143,4965
4965,1,20,Robin ,"Yeah, what the hell? It's prom. That tastes like cough syrup.",144,4966
4966,1,20,,"Boy #1: Yeah, we couldn't get any alcohol. Um, our fake IDs say we're only 20. We didn't realize it till after we bought them.",145,4967
4967,1,20,Robin ,"Nerds who aren't good at math? Life's going to be rough, boys.",146,4968
4968,1,20,Lily ,"Hi. Excuse me. I was wondering if you guys could play ""Good Feeling"" by the Violent Femmes. I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married and my fiancé wants to hire you guys as the band, but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play ""Good Feeling"" because that's our song, and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?",147,4969
4969,1,20,Man ,"Look, I'm kinda wasted right now, so I didn't understand any of that. But, uh, if you get us the sheet music, we'll play your song.",148,4970
4970,1,20,,"Boy #1: So, you buzzing, baby?",149,4971
4971,1,20,Robin ,My phlegm feels looser.,150,4972
4972,1,20,Ted ,"This is pathetic. It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights. If I got in a fight, would you have my back?",151,4973
4973,1,20,Marshall ,You know it.,152,4974
4974,1,20,Ted ,"I'd have your back, too.",153,4975
4975,1,20,Marshall ,That's cool.,154,4976
4976,1,20,Ted ,"What, you don't think you'd need my help? You don't know what I can do. I'm like... like a berserker.",155,4977
4977,1,20,Marshall ,"Okay, Ted. (His phone starts rigging) Hello.",156,4978
4978,1,20,Robin ,"Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music for ""Good Feeling"" and bring it out here, like, now.",157,4979
4979,1,20,Marshall ,Hang on. It's Robin. She wants me to go to prom. Can Ted come?,158,4980
4980,1,20,Ted ,Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame! I don't even want to go anyway.,159,4981
4981,1,20,Robin ,"Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us.",160,4982
4982,1,20,Ted ,What'd she say? What'd she say?,161,4983
4983,1,20,Robin ,"He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me. I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive. Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's, it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes.",162,4984
4984,1,20,Marshall ,"Okay, bye. She totally wants you to come.",163,4985
4985,1,20,Robin ,"All right, sheet music's on the way. Are you okay?",164,4986
4986,1,20,Lily ,There's just so much to do for this wedding. My head is swirling. It's just all moving too fast.,165,4987
4987,1,20,Scooter ,How is it moving too fast? We've been together for two years.,166,4988
4988,1,20,Lily ,I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already.,167,4989
4989,1,20,Scooter ,"What's decided? I go to umpire school, you go to college. We move into my dad's house in Staten Island. We have kids, we grow old together. What's decided? It's wide open!",168,4990
4990,1,20,Lily ,"Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us.",169,4991
4991,1,20,Scooter ,"You're, you're breaking up with me?",170,4992
4992,1,20,Lily ,"There's still so much I want to do. I want to travel, live overseas as an artist, maybe have a lesbian relationship. Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain.",171,4993
4993,1,20,Scooter ,"I can't believe this. I can change. I can look more like Kurt Cobain. Please, just don't leave me. I'm nothing without you, baby.",172,4994
4994,1,20,Lily ,Please don't put that kind of pressure on me! It's too much!,173,4995
4995,1,20,,"Boy #2: It's just one dance, God!",174,4996
4996,1,20,Lily ,What?,175,4997
4997,1,20,Robin ,"Well, we did promise them one dance.",176,4998
4998,1,20,Lily ,"Yeah, sure, okay. So Andrew, what's your big plan? What's life going to be like after tonight?",177,4999
4999,1,20,Andrew ,"Well, you know I got it all worked out. Uh, leave this place in my dust, four awesome years at college, and then I'll move to Prague or start my own video game company or something.",178,5000
5000,1,20,Lily ,"No, you won't.",179,5001
5001,1,20,Andrew ,I won't?,180,5002
5002,1,20,Lily ,"No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to. You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old before your time wondering ""Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?""",181,5003
5003,1,20,Andrew ,Whoa. You really think I'll get a girlfriend?,182,5004
5004,1,20,,"Boy #1: So, uh, what's the deal here? Am I getting lucky tonight?",183,5005
5005,1,20,Robin ,"Oh, Sean, look, um, you're a nice guy, but I just don't... No, you're not getting lucky tonight.",184,5006
5006,1,20,Giant Turtle," Okay, just be cool. Don't look at me.",185,5007
5007,1,20,Ted ,Okay.,186,5008
5008,1,20,Giant Turtle, How'd you get in here?,187,5009
5009,1,20,Marshall ,"What's it to you, giant turtle?",188,5010
5010,1,20,Giant Turtle," It's me, Barney.",189,5011
5011,1,20,Marshall ,"Oh, hey. Where's Lily?",190,5012
5012,1,20,Barney ,She's in the bathroom.,191,5013
5013,1,20,Marshall ,"Wait here, I should go talk to the band.",192,5014
5014,1,20,Ted ,All right.,193,5015
5015,1,20,Barney ,How did you guys get in here?,194,5016
5016,1,20,Ted ,We just snuck in the back.,195,5017
5017,1,20,Barney ,You just snu... Are you serious? I've been trying to get in here all night. I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume.,196,5018
5018,1,20,Ted ,But you got in. Slow and steady won the race.,197,5019
5019,1,20,Marshall ,"Hey, bro, have you seen my fiancée Lily?",198,5020
5020,1,20,Andrew ,"Your fiancée? Whoa, tonight she's with me, bro. Unless you're looking for trouble.",199,5021
5021,1,20,Marshall ,"Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom and the adrenaline's pumping, but...",200,5022
5022,1,20,Andrew ,"No, not tonight. I've waited too long for this. I finally got a girl and I'm not going to let you take her away from me.",201,5023
5023,1,20,Marshall ,"Whoa, whoa. Look, let's not get carried away.",202,5024
5024,1,20,Andrew ,Yah! Nunchaku!,203,5025
5025,1,20,Lily ,I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior.,204,5026
5026,1,20,Robin ,"I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me. I'm going to ask you something and, um, maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever. But, um, are you having second thoughts?",205,5027
5027,1,20,Lily ,Yeah. But not about Marshall. About me. I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago and wondering what happened to her.,206,5028
5028,1,20,Lily ,"I don't want to be tied down. I want to live in France and Spain and Italy and just soak up life and put it on a canvas, even if it means being a waitress in crappy cafés for five years, I don't care. I'm going to be a painter. And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know? But anyway, I'm blabbering. Way to make new friends, Lily. I'm sorry. What was your name again?",207,5029
5029,1,20,Man ,Marshall.,208,5030
5030,1,20,Lily ,"Nice to meet you, Marshall. Guess we're hallmates.",209,5031
5031,1,20,Marshall ,Yeah.,210,5032
5032,1,20,Lily ,It works.,211,5033
5033,1,20,Marshall ,Violent Femmes. I love this song.,212,5034
5034,1,20,Lily ,"Me, too.",213,5035
5035,1,20,Lily ,"I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to. The travel, the bohemian art life, my big lesbian experience. I didn't do any of it.",214,5036
5036,1,20,Robin ,"Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world. I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined?",215,5037
5037,1,20,Lily ,Yeah.,216,5038
5038,1,20,Robin ,"And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint. And as far as your lesbian experience... Happy?",217,5039

5043,1,20,Ted ,"Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus. You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here.",222,5044
5044,1,20,Marshall ,I totally could have taken that kid.,223,5045
5045,1,20,Ted ,"Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so...",224,5046
5046,1,20,Marshall ,"Well, I don't need it, but thanks.",225,5047
5047,1,20,Ted ,"Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome.",226,5048
5048,1,20,Marshall ,"No, the kid was totally, like, a white belt and I'm gigantic. Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need to get in there for one more song.",227,5049
5049,1,20,Security guards, Absolutely not.,228,5050

5054,1,20,Ted ,So how was your first prom?,233,5055
5055,1,20,Robin ,"You tell me. I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me, there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl.",234,5056
5056,1,20,Ted ,"So, basically, it was a prom.",235,5057
5057,1,20,Robin ,"Okay, I've missed you. Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way, not even in an I-forgive-you way. Just in a I've-missed-you way.",236,5058
5058,1,20,Ted ,I'll take what I can get.,237,5059
5059,1,20,Barney ,"And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth when you wear jeans to a strip club.",238,5060
5060,1,20,Marshall ,"So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song.",239,5061
5061,1,20,Lily ,"Yeah, it's good.",240,5062

5071,1,21,Robin ,"Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this.",8,5072
5072,1,21,Barney ,"I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted.",9,5073
5073,1,21,Marshall ,"You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy.",10,5074

5097,1,21,Woman ,What are you talking about?,34,5098
5098,1,21,Barney ,You've had a terrible fall.,35,5099

5110,1,21,Ted ,"I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.",47,5111
5111,1,21,Lily ,"Well, what's perfect?",48,5112
5112,1,21,Ted ,It's not like I have a list.,49,5113
5113,1,21,Robin ,"Oh, yes, you do.",50,5114
5114,1,21,Ted ,"Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...",51,5115
5115,1,21,Lily ,That's not hard. I know at least...,52,5116
5116,1,21,Ted ,"I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.",53,5117
5117,1,21,Marshall ,Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.,54,5118
5118,1,21,Ted ,"Any Kim from any cool band, really. Can't be too picky.",55,5119
5119,1,21,Lily ,You're never going to find this girl.,56,5120
5120,1,21,Ted ,Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me. I am done trying to plan the unplannable.,57,5121
5121,1,21,Marshall ,"So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?",58,5122
5122,1,21,Ted ,That's the plan.,59,5123
5123,1,21,,"Ted from 2030: And little did I know, at that very moment, fate... in the form of a 600 gigahertz superprocessing computer... was taking care of it.",60,5124
5124,1,21,Ted ,"Whoa, you're up early.",61,5125
5125,1,21,Lily ,"Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.",62,5126
5126,1,21,Ted ,Does Marshall know?,63,5127
5127,1,21,Lily ,He's still sound asleep.,64,5128
5128,1,21,Marshall ,"Awesome. So awesome. God! Best girl ever. Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.",65,5129
5129,1,21,Ted ,"Please don't do that. Hey, is this milk any good?",66,5130
5130,1,21,Marshall ,"Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.",67,5131
5131,1,21,Ted ,"God, why didn't you throw it away?",68,5132
5132,1,21,Lily ,I'm going shopping after work. I'll pick up some milk.,69,5133
5133,1,21,Marshall ,Oh...! These pancakes are delightful.,70,5134
5134,1,21,Lily ,"What's wrong, baby?",71,5135
5135,1,21,Marshall ,This is the high point of my day.,72,5136
5136,1,21,,"Ted from 2030: It was true. See, Marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment. But he needed money for the wedding, so he'd been interning for two months at Barney's firm... and he hated every minute of it.",73,5137
5137,1,21,Marshall ,"Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.",74,5138
5138,1,21,Barney ,Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.,75,5139
5139,1,21,Marshall ,"I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do.",76,5140
5140,1,21,Barney ,"Just take a look, will ya? Okay, corner office. Top floor. Check out that guy. Name's Clark Butterfield. He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs.",77,5141
5141,1,21,Marshall ,So?,78,5142
5142,1,21,Barney ,"So guess what I did to that sandwich? Here, I took a picture.",79,5143
5143,1,21,Marshall ,Oh! Sweet Lord.,80,5144
5144,1,21,Barney ,And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.,81,5145
5145,1,21,Marshall ,Ooh! Duck! That is sick! Why would you do that?,82,5146
5146,1,21,Barney ,Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot.,83,5147
5147,1,21,Marshall ,You?,84,5148
5148,1,21,Barney ,"Totally. Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great.",85,5149
5149,1,21,Marshall ,What?,86,5150
5150,1,21,Barney ,"Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern. This is war, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.",87,5151
5151,1,21,Marshall ,This is stupid.,88,5152
5152,1,21,Barney ,"Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills. I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.",89,5153
5153,1,21,Marshall ,"This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.",90,5154
5154,1,21,Barney ,"Tracy, could you come in here, please? Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him.",91,5155
5155,1,21,Tracy ,"Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer...",92,5156
5156,1,21,Marshall ,"I get it. Thank you, Tracy.",93,5157
5157,1,21,Ted ,Hello?,94,5158
5158,1,21,Man ,Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?,95,5159
5159,1,21,Ted ,Speaking.,96,5160
5160,1,21,Man ,"Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir? Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions. You signed up for our services about six months ago.",97,5161
5161,1,21,Ted ,"Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.",98,5162
5162,1,21,Bob ,"Right. Well... actually, that's why I'm calling. We found her, sir. We found your soul mate.",99,5163
5163,1,21,Ted ,I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?,100,5164
5164,1,21,Bob ,"Well, my firm bought out the company. You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate, but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so... here I am.",101,5165
5165,1,21,Ted ,So I'm in good hands. You found me a match?,102,5166
5166,1,21,Bob ,There she is. Your soul mate. That'll be 500 bucks.,103,5167
5167,1,21,Ted ,"No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.",104,5168
5168,1,21,Bob ,She's not engaged. She's your soul mate. Just read the file.,105,5169
5169,1,21,,"Ted from 2030: So I read the file. And by God, this woman was perfect. She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina, she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword, she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna, her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl.",106,5170
5170,1,21,Ted ,"All right, fine. Set it up.",107,5171
5171,1,21,Marshall ,"You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?",108,5172
5172,1,21,Barney ,Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.,109,5173
5173,1,21,Marshall ,Tastes normal to me.,110,5174
5174,1,21,Barney ,"That's what I thought, too. Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.",111,5175
5175,1,21,Marshall ,"Oh, God!",112,5176
5176,1,21,Barney ,It got me as well.,113,5177
5177,1,21,Marshall ,"Well, then why did you have me drink it?!",114,5178
5178,1,21,Barney ,Because now... you're in.,115,5179
5179,1,21,Marshall ,Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that b*st*rd pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first?,116,5180
5180,1,21,Barney ,"Yeah, it's probably a good idea.",117,5181
5181,1,21,,"Ted from 2030: So that night I had a blind date with my perfect match. I was so excited, I got there early. But before it even started...",118,5182
5182,1,21,Ted ,Lily?,119,5183
5183,1,21,Lily ,"Hey, Ted, are you busy?",120,5184
5184,1,21,Ted ,Um... yes.,121,5185
5185,1,21,Lily ,"Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot. Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?",122,5186
5186,1,21,Ted ,What? What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?,123,5187
5187,1,21,Lily ,"Marshall can't know about this. Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story. Can you please hurry?",124,5188
5188,1,21,Ted ,"I can't, I'm waiting...",125,5189
5189,1,21,Lily ,"Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand? No, drifter, no!",126,5190
5190,1,21,Ted ,"Come on, Lily.",127,5191
5191,1,21,Lily ,But you see my point.,128,5192
5192,1,21,Ted ,"All right, stay there. I'm on my way.",129,5193
5193,1,21,,"Ted from 2030: And so, one $90 cab ride later, I was in the middle of nowhere.",130,5194
5194,1,21,Lily ,"Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date?",131,5195
5195,1,21,Ted ,Yes.,132,5196
5196,1,21,Lily ,And was she okay about pushing it back?,133,5197
5197,1,21,Ted ,Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?,134,5198
5198,1,21,Lily ,You can never tell Marshall.,135,5199
5199,1,21,Ted ,I won't.,136,5200
5200,1,21,Lily ,Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.,137,5201
5201,1,21,Ted ,I swear on Luke and Leia.,138,5202
5202,1,21,Lily ,"About a month ago, I started getting insomnia. Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time. But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.",139,5203
5203,1,21,Ted ,Did you talk to Marshall about it?,140,5204
5204,1,21,Lily ,"He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...",141,5205
5205,1,21,Ted ,That was you? Awesome!,142,5206
5206,1,21,Lily ,"I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.",143,5207
5207,1,21,Ted ,Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.,144,5208
5208,1,21,Lily ,"San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven.",145,5209
5209,1,21,Ted ,You don't want to get married.,146,5210
5210,1,21,Lily ,Of course I want to get married. I... It's not like I was ever going to do it. I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.,147,5211
5211,1,21,Ted ,"Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means.",148,5212
5212,1,21,Lily ,"Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid.",149,5213
5213,1,21,Ted ,I don't think you're stupid.,150,5214
5214,1,21,Lily ,I love Marshall.,151,5215
5215,1,21,Ted ,I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.,152,5216
5216,1,21,Lily ,But why am I the only one? How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?,153,5217
5217,1,21,Marshall ,So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.,154,5218
5218,1,21,Ted ,All done.,155,5219
5219,1,21,Lily ,"Ted, let's go to New Haven.",156,5220
5220,1,21,Ted ,"Lily, don't do this to yourself.",157,5221
5221,1,21,Lily ,"I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure.",158,5222
5222,1,21,Ted ,"No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.",159,5223
5223,1,21,Lily ,"Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, ""Yep. That was a mistake."" So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you?",160,5224
5224,1,21,Ted ,"I don't know. You said ""mistake"" a lot. Lily, don't do this.",161,5225
5225,1,21,Lily ,"Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.",162,5226
5226,1,21,Ted ,"Forgive you for what? (Lily leaves with he car) Lily. Lily! Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road. I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk... Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to k*ll you. And, also, I texted you the same thing. (He calls Barney) Hey, I need a big favor.",163,5227
5227,1,21,Barney ,"Anything, bro.",164,5228
5228,1,21,Ted ,I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.,165,5229
5229,1,21,Barney ,No.,166,5230
5230,1,21,Ted ,It's kind of an emergency.,167,5231
5231,1,21,Barney ,What are you doing in Duchess County?,168,5232
5232,1,21,Ted ,Apple picking. Can you just get up here?,169,5233
5233,1,21,Barney ,"I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work. We're kind of swamped.",170,5234
5234,1,21,Marshall ,Is that Ted?,171,5235
5235,1,21,Barney ,Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County.,172,5236
5236,1,21,Marshall ,Don't you have a big date tonight?,173,5237
5237,1,21,Ted ,"Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.",174,5238
5238,1,21,Marshall ,So what are you doing in Duchess County?,175,5239
5239,1,21,Ted ,Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!,176,5240
5240,1,21,Marshall ,"Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you.",177,5241
5241,1,21,Ted ,No!,178,5242
5242,1,21,Marshall ,"Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.",179,5243
5243,1,21,Ted ,"No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank. I'm not in Duchess County.",180,5244
5244,1,21,Marshall ,So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County?,181,5245
5245,1,21,Ted ,Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.,182,5246
5246,1,21,Barney ,"Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield.",183,5247
5247,1,21,Marshall ,"You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously. Which is great, and everything, but I can't imagine having this much fun over there.",184,5248
5248,1,21,Barney ,You thinking about coming to work here full-time?,185,5249
5249,1,21,Marshall ,"Maybe. Don't tell Lily, okay?",186,5250
5250,1,21,Tracy ,Taking off for the night.,187,5251
5251,1,21,Barney ,"Thanks, Tracy.",188,5252
5252,1,21,Tracy ,Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?,189,5253
5253,1,21,Barney ,Of course we are. Were you going to think of that?,190,5254
5254,1,21,Marshall ,No.,191,5255
5255,1,21,Barney ,That would have been bad.,192,5256
5256,1,21,Marshall ,Horrible.,193,5257
5257,1,21,,"Ted from 2030: Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home.",194,5258
5258,1,21,Robin ,"Need a ride, cowboy?",195,5259
5259,1,21,Ted ,Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.,196,5260
5260,1,21,Robin ,"Hmm, too bad. I got candy.",197,5261
5261,1,21,Ted ,Candy?!,198,5262
5262,1,21,Robin ,So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?,199,5263
5263,1,21,Ted ,Nope. Sworn to secrecy.,200,5264
5264,1,21,Robin ,"Oh, come on.",201,5265
5265,1,21,Ted ,I like your hat.,202,5266
5266,1,21,Robin ,Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights.,203,5267
5267,1,21,Ted ,"Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine.",204,5268
5268,1,21,Robin ,"Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took ""highlights"" to mean, ""I want to look like a tiger,"" hence the hat.",205,5269
5269,1,21,Ted ,Oh. I gotta see this.,206,5270
5270,1,21,Robin ,No way.,207,5271
5271,1,21,Ted ,Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat!,208,5272
5272,1,21,Robin ,"So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?",209,5273
5273,1,21,Ted ,"Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.",210,5274
5274,1,21,Robin ,"Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.",211,5275
5275,1,21,Ted ,"Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.",212,5276
5276,1,21,Robin ,"I read that. More like ""Love in the Time of Don't Bothera.""",213,5277
5277,1,21,Ted ,"You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.",214,5278
5278,1,21,Robin ,We're not indoors. We're in a van.,215,5279
5279,1,21,Ted ,Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.,216,5280
5280,1,21,Robin ,Never. What else?,217,5281
5281,1,21,Ted ,She loves lasagna.,218,5282
5282,1,21,Robin ,Barf.,219,5283
5283,1,21,Ted ,"You know, I am sensing a pattern here.",220,5284
5284,1,21,Robin ,What else?,221,5285
5285,1,21,Ted ,"Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.",222,5286
5286,1,21,Robin ,And she's looking to get married and have kids?,223,5287
5287,1,21,Ted ,Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl.,224,5288
5288,1,21,Robin ,"Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids.",225,5289
5289,1,21,Ted ,Really? You don't want kids?,226,5290
5290,1,21,Robin ,"You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8:56. You're early.",227,5291
5291,1,21,Ted ,"Hey, thanks for picking me up.",228,5292
5292,1,21,Robin ,Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for.,229,5293
5293,1,21,Ted ,Thanks.,230,5294
5294,1,21,Robin ,"All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.",231,5295
5295,1,21,Ted ,You're going to show me your hair?,232,5296
5296,1,21,Robin ,"Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.",233,5297
5297,1,21,Ted ,You just made my night.,234,5298
5298,1,21,Robin ,Go.,235,5299
5299,1,21,Marshall ,"Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice. Oh, hey, dude.",236,5300
5300,1,21,Ted ,"Hey, guys.",237,5301
5301,1,21,Lily ,Hi.,238,5302
5302,1,21,Ted ,"Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?",239,5303
5303,1,21,Lily ,"Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.",240,5304
5304,1,21,Ted ,You think you might want to... drink the milk?,241,5305
5305,1,21,Lily ,"No. Nope, I'm good. I don't need any milk.",242,5306
5306,1,21,Marshall ,"Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date. How'd it go, dude?",243,5307
5307,1,21,Ted ,I didn't go.,244,5308
5308,1,21,Marshall ,What? Why?,245,5309
5309,1,21,Ted ,I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.,246,5310
5310,1,21,Marshall ,Why? She sounds perfect.,247,5311
5311,1,21,Ted ,I don't want perfect. I want Robin.,248,5312
5312,1,21,Marshall ,"Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake.",249,5313
5313,1,21,Ted ,Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make.,250,5314
5314,1,21,Marshall ,Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence. You and Robin have tried this again and again...,251,5315
5315,1,21,,"Ted from 2030: Here's the thing about mistakes. Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake, you gotta make it anyway.",252,5316
5316,1,21,Lily ,"Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.",253,5317
5317,1,21,Ted ,"Hey, is this milk any good?",254,5318
5318,1,21,,Ted from 2030: Even really really dumb mistakes.,255,5319
5319,1,22,,Ted from 2030: It was May of 2006 in New York City and life was good. But everything was about to change.,1,5320
5320,1,22,Ted ,So... what do you think?,2,5321
5321,1,22,Barney ,"Robin again? Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together. Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.",3,5322
5322,1,22,Ted ,But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?,4,5323
5323,1,22,Marshall ,Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills. Anybody else get chills?,5,5324
5324,1,22,Ted ,"Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Robin, so... I gotta do this. (Barney slaps him) Ow! What the hell?",6,5325
5325,1,22,Barney ,That wasn't me. That was the universe.,7,5326
5326,1,22,,"Ted from 2030: The funny thing was, at that very moment, the universe was working on something... a storm.",8,5327
5327,1,22,Weather man," And so tropical storm Willy is going to be with us at least until Monday. It's gonna rain cats and dogs, folks. So don't step in a poodle. Sandy? Robin?",9,5328
5328,1,22,Robin ,"Thanks, Lou. Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend.",10,5329
5329,1,22,Sandy ,"Yeah, but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck.",11,5330
5330,1,22,Robin ,Guess we'll have to take a rain check.,12,5331
5331,1,22,Sandy ,"And we'll check in with you tomorrow, New York.",13,5332
5332,1,22,Robin ,Have a great night.,14,5333
5333,1,22,Man ,"And, we're clear.",15,5334
5334,1,22,Sandy ,"Bummer. I was hoping to finally have s*x with you this weekend, Scherbotsky.",16,5335
5335,1,22,Robin ,"Well, I'd give you the ""I don't date coworkers"" speech again, but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now.",17,5336
5336,1,22,Sandy ,"Shame, though. It was a pretty hot show tonight. The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end really got my freak juice flowing.",18,5337
5337,1,22,Marshall ,"Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash and burn before you say, ""enough""?",19,5338
5338,1,22,Ted ,"One more. One more time. One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture. And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it. If it's yes, great. If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever.",20,5339
5339,1,22,Lily ,"So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?",21,5340
5340,1,22,Ted ,"I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment.",22,5341
5341,1,22,Barney ,"I see where this is going. Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work... usually. The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999. The characters: Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name...",23,5342
5342,1,22,Lily ,"Universe. So, this plan you speak of?",24,5343
5343,1,22,Ted ,Remember the first night Robin and I went out? I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.,25,5344
5344,1,22,Marshall ,"Yeah. Dude, that was awesome, but how are you ever going to top that?",26,5345
5345,1,22,Ted ,She should be here any second.,27,5346
5346,1,22,Musician ,"Uh, we're pretty hungry. When do we get our pizza?",28,5347
5347,1,22,Ted ,"Enough with the... we'll go get pizza later, all right? Just...",29,5348
5348,1,22,Robin ,Damn it.,30,5349
5349,1,22,Lily ,Hello.,31,5350
5350,1,22,Robin ,"Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key.",32,5351
5351,1,22,Lily ,Extra key? Do I have an extra key to your apartment?,33,5352
5352,1,22,Robin ,"Yes, I gave it to you.",34,5353
5353,1,22,Lily ,"Oh, right. That key. Yeah, I lost it.",35,5354
5354,1,22,Robin ,"Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith.",36,5355
5355,1,22,Lily ,"No, wait, uh... Maybe you should just knock.",37,5356
5356,1,22,Robin ,"Knock? Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained.",38,5357
5357,1,22,Voice mail," Hello, Lily, this is Janet Kagan at the Russell House Art Foundation here in San Francisco. I'm pleased to inform you that we've accepted your application for our summer fellowship. We look forward to hearing from you. Bye-bye.",39,5358
5358,1,22,Lily ,"Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay?",40,5359
5359,1,22,Marshall ,Summer fellowship?,41,5360
5360,1,22,Robin ,Just knock. Okay.,42,5361
5361,1,22,Ted ,Hi.,43,5362
5362,1,22,Robin ,Hi.,44,5363
5363,1,22,Ted ,"Robin... I've sort of said this already. I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly. So this is me, just saying it. With strings. I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together. What do you say? What do you say?",45,5364
5364,1,22,Robin ,Yes. No. I don't know.,46,5365
5365,1,22,Ted ,Those are the three options.,47,5366
5366,1,22,Robin ,"Ted, this is so...",48,5367
5367,1,22,Ted ,I know.,49,5368
5368,1,22,Robin ,"I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and... I have to pee.",50,5369
5369,1,22,Ted ,"Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait.",51,5370
5370,1,22,Musician ,"Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier, you said there'd be pizza.",52,5371
5371,1,22,Ted ,"No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards. Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here.",53,5372
5372,1,22,Musician ,Sure. We're not getting any pizza.,54,5373
5373,1,22,Robin ,Okay. Let's talk.,55,5374
5374,1,22,Ted ,"Okay. Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?",56,5375
5375,1,22,Robin ,"Thanks, guys. Just need a minute. Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though. Kind of an inside joke. Thanks. (The musicians leave) You're crazy.",57,5376
5376,1,22,Ted ,Right. Come on.,58,5377
5377,1,22,Robin ,"It's not that I haven't thought about this. You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay? We only just started being friends again.",59,5378
5378,1,22,Ted ,I know. But... come on...,60,5379
5379,1,22,Robin ,"And we want different things. That's still there. That's not going away. I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out and I'd lose you as a friend? I gotta think about this.",61,5380
5380,1,22,Ted ,"Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane. Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious. I'm kidding. I'm serious.",62,5381
5381,1,22,Robin ,"I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping.",63,5382
5382,1,22,Ted ,I thought that thing was canceled.,64,5383
5383,1,22,Robin ,"Well, it's back on.",65,5384
5384,1,22,Ted ,Since when?,66,5385
5385,1,22,Robin ,Since like an hour ago.,67,5386
5386,1,22,Weather man,..sending the storm back out into the Atlantic. So it's blue skies this weekend. Sandy? Robin?,68,5387
5387,1,22,Sandy ,"Thanks, Lou, but that blue sky isn't without at least one cloud. I'm sorry to announce that one week from today I will be leaving Metro News One. It has been an honor to bring you the news each night, and read the paper to you each morning. I will always treasure it. Good night, New York.",69,5388
5388,1,22,Man ,And we're clear.,70,5389
5389,1,22,Robin ,You're leaving?,71,5390
5390,1,22,Sandy ,There. I quit my job. We're not coworkers. Will you please have dinner with me? I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN.,72,5391
5391,1,22,Robin ,"Oh, congratulations.",73,5392
5392,1,22,Sandy ,Congratulations yourself.,74,5393
5393,1,22,Robin ,What do you mean?,75,5394
5394,1,22,Sandy ,"Well, Joel asked me who I thought should replace me as lead anchor. I told him you. They're announcing it next week. Act surprised.",76,5395
5395,1,22,Robin ,"Wow. Thanks. And, yes.",77,5396
5396,1,22,Sandy ,"Yes, what?",78,5397
5397,1,22,Robin ,"Yes, let's go get dinner.",79,5398
5398,1,22,Sandy ,How about this weekend on the camping trip? I roast a mean weenie.,80,5399
5399,1,22,Ted ,"Oh, you're kidding me. No way. Don't go on this thing.",81,5400
5400,1,22,Robin ,"Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip.",82,5401
5401,1,22,Ted ,Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date. With Sandy... and his weenie. I mean is this not a date?,83,5402
5402,1,22,Robin ,I don't-I don't know.,84,5403
5403,1,22,Ted ,"So, what? You actually like this guy now?",85,5404
5404,1,22,Robin ,I don't know.,86,5405
5405,1,22,Ted ,Are you gonna hook up with him?,87,5406
5406,1,22,Robin ,I don't know.,88,5407
5407,1,22,Ted ,"Yes, you do.",89,5408
5408,1,22,Robin ,"No, Ted, I don't. And you know what? That's okay. I don't plan out every second of my life like you do.",90,5409
5409,1,22,Ted ,I don't plan out every...,91,5410
5410,1,22,Robin ,"Oh, really? What is all of this? I mean, why can't you just say, ""Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?"" No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates and let's spend the rest of our lives together.",92,5411
5411,1,22,Ted ,"Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point? God, you are so terrified of anything real. It's like you're floating out in space. Touch the ground, Robin. Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake.",93,5412
5412,1,22,Robin ,I need to think about this.,94,5413
5413,1,22,Ted ,Fine.,95,5414
5414,1,22,Robin ,"No, I'm sorry, I... I can't do this anymore. I need an answer.",96,5415
5415,1,22,Ted ,"If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that.",97,5416
5416,1,22,Robin ,"Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no.",98,5417
5417,1,22,Ted ,Then I guess it's not meant to be.,99,5418
5418,1,22,Barney ,"Nice try, buddy.",100,5419
5419,1,22,Marshall ,Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure. She's made her choice and you can finally move on.,101,5420
5420,1,22,Ted ,Screw that. This ain't over.,102,5421
5421,1,22,Marshall ,"Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said...",103,5422
5422,1,22,Ted ,"I don't care what I said. This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be. It is meant to be, and you know why? 'Cause I mean it to be.",104,5423
5423,1,22,Lily ,Unpause?,105,5424
5424,1,22,Marshall ,Unpause.,106,5425
5425,1,22,,"Ted from 2030: Let's pause. See, Marshall and Lily had a rule that at any point during a fight they could pause and take a break. Their fights often lasted for days.",107,5426
5426,1,22,Marshall ,A painting fellowship?,108,5427
5427,1,22,Lily ,I was never going to take it.,109,5428
5428,1,22,Marshall ,In California?,110,5429
5429,1,22,Lily ,I was never going to take it.,111,5430
5430,1,22,Barney ,"Ted, she is going on that camping trip. Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.",112,5431
5431,1,22,Ted ,"Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is.",113,5432
5432,1,22,Barney ,What are you talking about?,114,5433
5433,1,22,Ted ,I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain!,115,5434
5434,1,22,Barney ,"Ted, do you want me to slap you again? 'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.",116,5435
5435,1,22,Ted ,"Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?",117,5436
5436,1,22,Barney ,Yeah.,118,5437
5437,1,22,Ted ,Are you still in touch with her?,119,5438
5438,1,22,Barney ,"Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having s*x, we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up, and of course I'm not in touch with her!",120,5439
5439,1,22,Ted ,"Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.",121,5440
5440,1,22,Barney ,"Did you just say a ""rain dance""?",122,5441
5441,1,22,Ted ,Yes.,123,5442
5442,1,22,Barney ,A rain dance.,124,5443
5443,1,22,Ted ,Yes.,125,5444
5444,1,22,Barney ,A dance to make it rain.,126,5445
5445,1,22,Ted ,Yes. (Barney slaps him once again and Ted slaps him back. Barney tries again to slaps Ted but he stops him) We're finding Penelope!,127,5446
5446,1,22,Barney ,"No, we are not!",128,5447
5447,1,22,Ted ,"Yes, we are!",129,5448
5448,1,22,Barney ,"Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!",130,5449
5449,1,22,Penelope ,Why the hell should I help you?,131,5450
5450,1,22,Barney ,"Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship.",132,5451
5451,1,22,Penelope ,"We had s*x twice in your car, and then you dumped me. How is that a relationship?",133,5452
5452,1,22,Barney ,Twice!,134,5453
5453,1,22,Penelope ,"Barney, there is no way...",135,5454
5454,1,22,Barney ,Shh!,136,5455
5455,1,22,Penelope ,"Seriously, come on.",137,5456
5456,1,22,Ted ,"Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend.",138,5457
5457,1,22,Penelope ,Why?,139,5458
5458,1,22,Ted ,There's this girl...,140,5459
5459,1,22,Penelope ,"""There's this girl."" You know, the traditional rain dance is a sacred prayer to nature. I don't think the Great Spirit looks too kindly on white dudes who co-opt it to get laid.",141,5460
5460,1,22,Ted ,"Penelope, this is the girl I love. If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy. Please.",142,5461
5461,1,22,Penelope ,"This wrong guy, is he a huge jackass?",143,5462
5462,1,22,Ted ,Absolutely.,144,5463
5463,1,22,Penelope ,Kind of like Barney?,145,5464
5464,1,22,Ted ,Kind of.,146,5465
5465,1,22,Barney ,Hey.,147,5466
5466,1,22,Penelope ,You hit on my mom!,148,5467
5467,1,22,Barney ,We weren't exclusive!,149,5468
5468,1,22,Penelope ,I'm in.,150,5469
5469,1,22,,Ted from 2030: And so the three of us headed up to the roof of my building.,151,5470
5470,1,22,Penelope ,Okay. Crouch down and bend over a little bit.,152,5471
5471,1,22,Barney ,"Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position.",153,5472
5472,1,22,Penelope ,I will throw you off this roof.,154,5473
5473,1,22,Barney ,There's so much of your mom in you.,155,5474
5474,1,22,Robin ,And she's been throwing up ever since.,156,5475
5475,1,22,Veterinary ,So how'd she manage to eat so much chocolate?,157,5476
5476,1,22,Robin ,"Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about? Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment with a string quartet and roses and chocolates...",158,5477
5477,1,22,Veterinary ,"Oh, that's so sweet.",159,5478
5478,1,22,Robin ,"Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy? I mean, a string quartet in my living room... who does that?",160,5479
5479,1,22,Veterinary ,Nobody does that.,161,5480
5480,1,22,Robin ,Exactly.,162,5481
5481,1,22,Veterinary ,"No, honey... nobody does that. But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic. I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now.",163,5482
5482,1,22,Lily ,So you're saying you would forbid me from going?,164,5483
5483,1,22,Marshall ,"Forbid? Who said forbid? I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months, and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day. Look for me... I'll be the guy in the awesome suit. Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted.",165,5484
5484,1,22,Lily ,"Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them. I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever.",166,5485
5485,1,22,Marshall ,"So now we've gone from ""I was never gonna do it"" to ""I need to do this""? Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?",167,5486
5486,1,22,Lily ,"Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it.",168,5487
5487,1,22,Marshall ,"I never said that! You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now, what's gonna change in three months? Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.",169,5488
5488,1,22,Lily ,Maybe not.,170,5489
5489,1,22,Marshall ,Pause.,171,5490
5490,1,22,Lily ,"So, are you just, like, starving?",172,5491
5491,1,22,Marshall ,Totally. Red Lobster?,173,5492
5492,1,22,Lily ,"Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious!",174,5493
5493,1,22,Marshall ,"Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it. Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you.",175,5494
5494,1,22,Lily ,"I wouldn't dare. (Marshall starts crying) Marshall, no. We're on pause. There's no crying in Pauseland! Pauseland is a magical place, with... with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers! Damn it!",176,5495
5495,1,22,Waiters ,"Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy birthday, happy, happy, happy, happy, appy, happy birthday, happy, happy...",177,5496
5496,1,22,Barney ,"Ted, this is funny. Still funny. Still fu... And now it's sad.",178,5497
5497,1,22,Ted ,"Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?",179,5498
5498,1,22,Penelope ,I think so.,180,5499
5499,1,22,Ted ,"Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance?",181,5500
5500,1,22,Penelope ,I think so.,182,5501
5501,1,22,Ted ,"Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?",183,5502
5502,1,22,Penelope ,No.,184,5503
5503,1,22,Ted ,No?,185,5504
5504,1,22,Penelope ,"I've read extensively on the subject: firsthand accounts, theoretical criticism, the anthropological...",186,5505
5505,1,22,Ted ,Have you ever seen a rain dance?,187,5506
5506,1,22,Penelope ,I've seen a film strip.,188,5507
5507,1,22,Ted ,"Terrific. Uh, look, I should run. I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R. I can't believe this. We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves.",189,5508
5508,1,22,Penelope ,"What do you mean ""we,"" white man?",190,5509
5509,1,22,Marshall ,"How did we get here? Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was, did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge.",191,5510
5510,1,22,Lily ,I think there's still one left.,192,5511
5511,1,22,Marshall ,Dibs.,193,5512
5512,1,22,Lily ,Unpause?,194,5513
5513,1,22,Marshall ,Unpause.,195,5514
5514,1,22,Lily ,Look... I know this sucks. It's just something I'm going through. I'm not asking you to understand it. I'm not asking you to be happy about it. I'm just asking you to support it.,196,5515
5515,1,22,Marshall ,"I want to, Lily, okay? I really do. But I just can't.",197,5516
5516,1,22,Lily ,Why not?,198,5517
5517,1,22,Marshall ,"Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not. What if you decide to go be a painter and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore, and three months becomes forever? Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?",199,5518
5518,1,22,Lily ,Marshall...,200,5519
5519,1,22,Marshall ,"'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now. I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out.",201,5520
5520,1,22,Lily ,"Marshall, I love you.",202,5521
5521,1,22,Marshall ,Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?,203,5522
5522,1,22,Lily ,Pause.,204,5523
5523,1,22,Marshall ,"No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore. Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?!",205,5524
5524,1,22,Lily ,Pause!,206,5525
5525,1,22,Marshall ,"Why do you want me to pause?! (She throws herself on him et kisses him) That's just a great use of the pause function, baby.",207,5526
5526,1,22,Lily ,Thank you.,208,5527
5527,1,22,Barney ,"Hey, Ted. Whatcha doing?",209,5528
5528,1,22,Ted ,A rain dance.,210,5529
5529,1,22,Barney ,"Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.",211,5530
5530,1,22,Ted ,"Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour.",212,5531
5531,1,22,Barney ,These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl. This isn't gonna work!,213,5532
5532,1,22,Ted ,Yeah. I know that.,214,5533
5533,1,22,Barney ,"Well, then why are you doing this?",215,5534
5534,1,22,Ted ,"Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work. But it has to work! You hear me, universe? This is Ted Mosby talking! Give me some rain! Come on! Come on! Come on...!",216,5535
5535,1,22,Barney ,"Oh, come on!",217,5536
5536,1,22,Weather man, Pushing the front back into the Tri-State area and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade.,218,5537
5537,1,22,Barney ,How about that? He did it.,219,5538
5538,1,22,Ted ,"Robin! Hey, Robin! (Robin opens up her window) Oh, thank God you're here!",220,5539
5539,1,22,Robin ,My camping trip got rained out.,221,5540
5540,1,22,Ted ,I know. I'm sorry.,222,5541
5541,1,22,Robin ,It's not your fault.,223,5542
5542,1,22,Ted ,"Yeah, it is. Come down here.",224,5543
5543,1,22,Robin ,It's pouring. You come up.,225,5544
5544,1,22,Ted ,"No, you have to come down here.",226,5545
5545,1,22,Robin ,Why?,227,5546
5546,1,22,Ted ,"Why? Because I made it rain, that's what I did today! And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!",228,5547
5547,1,22,Robin ,"I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up.",229,5548
5548,1,22,Ted ,"I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not. You have to come down here!",230,5549
5549,1,22,Robin ,I was gonna...,231,5550
5550,1,22,Ted ,I know.,232,5551
5551,1,22,,"Ted from 2030: And that's how Robin and I ended up together. Turns out, all I had to do was make it rain. As I rode home the next morning, the city looked the same, the people looked the same. It all looked the same. But it wasn't. In just one night, everything had changed.",233,5552
5552,2,1,Ted ,"OK, where was I? It was June 2006 and life had just taken an unexpected turn.",1,5553
5553,2,1,Ted's daughter,Can't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom? I feel you've been talking for like a year,2,5554
5554,2,1,Ted ,"Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important. It's all part of the story.",3,5555
5555,2,1,Ted's son, Can I go to the bathroom?,4,5556
5556,2,1,Ted ,"No. The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful. For me, it started out great. (In 2006, Ted and Robin are kissing after the rain dance) In fact, day one was amazing. I'd finally gotten together with Robin. But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life, your Uncle Marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his (Ted finds Marshall on their stairs, holding in his hand Lily's engagement ring).",5,5557
5557,2,1,Marshall ,So that's it? We're breaking up?,6,5558
5558,2,1,Lily ,"Marshall, I'm sorry. I just... I just need to go to San Francisco and do this art program and figure out who I am outside of us. And the only way that I can do that is if we don't talk for a while.",7,5559
5559,2,1,Marshall ,"For a while? Try never, OK? You walk out that door and we're done. You're never gonna hear my voice again.",8,5560
5560,2,1,Marshall ,I should call her.,9,5561
5561,2,1,Ted ,"No! No! If you call her, when she asked you not to, you're just gonna look weak and you're gonna regret it. Now, listen. Whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first... and I will punch you in the face.",10,5562
5562,2,1,Marshall ,You're a good friend Ted.,11,5563
5563,2,1,Robin ,"Hey! So, did you hear the big news?",12,5564
5564,2,1,Ted ,"You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up and Lily is gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night? Yeah, I think he knows.",13,5565
5565,2,1,Robin ,Oh my god! I... I'm so sorry. What happened?,14,5566
5566,2,1,Marshall ,"Well, she left. And I don't even know if she's coming back.",15,5567
5567,2,1,Barney ,"I didn't get your message until I woke up. Bro, I am so sorry.",16,5568
5568,2,1,Marshall ,Thanks.,17,5569
5569,2,1,Barney ,I know it must be tough. But are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better but will actively excite you?,18,5570
5570,2,1,Marshall ,Sure.,19,5571
5571,2,1,Barney ,"For the first time ever, the three of us are single at the same time. I've dreamed about this day boys and it's going to be legendary! Together, we will own this city. Any time, a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriend, we'll be there. Any time a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge-drinking, we will be there. Any time a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo sticking their heads out, shouting ""What's up New York?"" we will be what is up New York! Gentlemen, we are about to embark on... (While he's speaking, Barney looks at Ted and then at Robin). Oh man, you guys did it, didn't you?!",20,5572
5572,2,1,,"Ted from 2030: One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning (Ted and Robin are making out) and love is ending (Lily is leaving the apartment, leaving Marshall alone) the first thirty days are remarkably similar. (DAY ONE, Ted and Robin are in bed after they had s*x) For one thing, you spend most of the time in bed (Marshall is in his bed groaning // DAY EIGHT, Ted and Robin are at MacLaren's with Barney, kissing and laughing. Barney seems to k*ll himself, miming a g*n in his mouth) Your friends can't stand to listen to you (DAY SIXTEEN, Barney is with Marshall who is crying and says ""It was a really beautiful song"". Barney mimes a rope around his neck). And you never seems to wear pants. (DAY TWENTY-TWO, at the apartment, Robin is going to the bathroom only wearing a T-shirt while Marshall is wallowing on the couch in underpants. Ted, in underpants too, comes out of his room).",21,5573
5573,2,1,Ted ,Hey Marshall.,22,5574
5574,2,1,Marshall ,Hey Ted.,23,5575
5575,2,1,Ted ,Are you hungry?,24,5576
5576,2,1,Marshall ,"What's the point? I could it some food, it's just gonna leave me.",25,5577
5577,2,1,Ted ,"At least in that scenario, you get to do the dumping. Come on, it's Sunday, it's pancakes day!",26,5578
5578,2,1,Marshall ,"Lily always made the pancakes. God, I loved her pancakes. So soft. So warmed. So perfectly shaped.",27,5579
5579,2,1,Ted ,"Are we still talking about her pancakes? Come on, you gotta eat something. What can I get you?",28,5580
5580,2,1,Marshall ,Beer.,29,5581
5581,2,1,Ted ,"No, that's what you had for dinner.",30,5582
5582,2,1,Marshall ,Fine. Than I'll just have the leftover,31,5583
5583,2,1,Barney ,"So he stays home all the time not getting laid? No, see, that's what you do when you have a fiancée. He should be down here celebrating. He's free. He got that red-head-tumor removed.",32,5584
5584,2,1,Ted ,You should write and illustrate children's books.,33,5585
5585,2,1,Barney ,"You know what Marshall needs to do? He needs to stop being sad. When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story.",34,5586
5586,2,1,Ted ,"It's only been a month. He just needs to goat his own pace. Anyway, lily is the one who caused this whole mess.",35,5587
5587,2,1,Robin ,"Hey, cut her some slack! She's our friend too. She's just trying to figure out who she is.",36,5588
5588,2,1,Ted ,"Figure out who she is? She should call me. I got a whole list. She's selfish, she's immature, she's...",37,5589
5589,2,1,Robin ,What?,38,5590
5590,2,1,Ted ,"God, your eyes are so blue.",39,5591
5591,2,1,Robin ,"Teddy bear... (They kiss, Barney mimes his death with a sword. Ted and Robin look at him and keep kissing)",40,5592
5592,2,1,,"Ted from 2030: Yeah it was hard to feel too bad. I was dating the woman of my dreams and things were going great. Well, for the most part. (Ted and Robin are watching TV, Marshall comes out of the bathroom, a bottle of shampoo in his hand).",41,5593
5593,2,1,Marshall ,"So, I find her shampoo. I guess she left it here. It smells like her. Like lavender and seashells. Hope. Somehow erotic and comforting all at the same time.",42,5594
5594,2,1,Robin ,That's my shampoo.,43,5595
5595,2,1,Marshall ,Oh. Sorry.,44,5596
5596,2,1,Robin ,I thought he's never go to sleep.,45,5597
5597,2,1,Ted ,Uh-oh.,46,5598
5598,2,1,Robin ,Already?,47,5599
5599,2,1,Ted ,He's calling her. Dammit!,48,5600
5600,2,1,Robin ,I don't hear anyth...Ted (going out of the bedroom): He's calling her! (Tackling Marshall) Argh!,49,5601
5601,2,1,Marshall ,"Oh! OK, you're right. I won't call her. I will not call her.",50,5602
5602,2,1,Marshall ,"Well, I called her. And get this, she changed her number. Well like I'm gonna stalk her or something? Like she's so special?! Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there? 'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her, based on the brief conversations I had with them!",51,5603
5603,2,1,Robin (to Ted) ,Does he know I'm in here?,52,5604
5604,2,1,Marshall ,"Yeah. Hey Robin. Anyway, one of the Lily Adrins...",53,5605
5605,2,1,Robin ,"This has to stop! Ted, we just started dating. We agreed we don't wanna move too fast and yet somehow we have a baby. He can't feed himself, he cries a lot, he keeps us up all night...",54,5606
5606,2,1,Barney ,Have you tried breast-feeding? Nailed it!,55,5607
5607,2,1,Ted ,They were together nine years. It's only been a month and a half. He just needs to go his own pace.,56,5608
5608,2,1,Robin ,He slept on our floor last night Ted.,57,5609
5609,2,1,Ted ,He watched a scary movie.,58,5610
5610,2,1,Robin ,It is time for some tough love. We need to get him out of that apartment. He needs fresh air. He needs sunshine.,59,5611
5611,2,1,Barney ,Mmm. Sunshine.,60,5612
5612,2,1,Man ,"Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Sunshine!",61,5613
5613,2,1,Marshall ,"Barney, I really don't think this is gonna help.",62,5614
5614,2,1,Barney ,"Do you know why you're not over Lily yet? It's 'cause you can still picture her naked. You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs. It's a scientific fact. The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images, or BPEGs and your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's.",63,5615
5615,2,1,Marshall ,There are a lot of them.,64,5616
5616,2,1,Barney ,"They won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs. Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs so we begin here tonight my friend. Two at the time. Those count as four.",65,5617
5617,2,1,Ted ,"Yeah, this is fun, right? We're outside, it's a beautiful day. The Indians are winning!",66,5618
5618,2,1,Marshall ,"I gotta admit, it is really nice to be outside.",67,5619
5619,2,1,Man ,"Yankee's fans, please turn your attention to the Diamond Vision for a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise.",68,5620
5620,2,1,Ted ,"Oh, no. (A man is proposing to his girlfriend. Marshall stands up and throws a hotdog at the engaged couple.)",69,5621
5621,2,1,Marshall ,"It's all a big lie! She's just gonna break your heart! (Men drag Marshall out of the stadium) You can drag me outta here, but she has no soul!",70,5622
5622,2,1,Ted ,"We've tried everything. Baseball, strippers. The guy still won't eat a damn pancake. I think he's beyond repair.",71,5623
5623,2,1,Robin ,"See, this is the problem with guys, you don't know how to deal with heartbreak.",72,5624
5624,2,1,Barney ,"So what's your prescription, Dr Oestrogen? Eat H&auml;agen-Dazs and Watch Love actually until your periods sync up? (Ted and Barney laugh)",73,5625
5625,2,1,Robin ,"Yeah, that's the stuff.",74,5626
5626,2,1,Marshall ,Oh my God! How long have you been doing this?,75,5627
5627,2,1,Robin ,"My Dad taught me to shoot when I was a kid. Now, whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here and it reminds me that... g*ns are fun!",76,5628
5628,2,1,Marshall ,"Um, you know, Ted is kinda against g*ns.Robin (turning to Marshall, her g*n still in her hand): That's why Ted never gonna find out about this. Whoa! That sort of got scary with me holding a g*n, didn't it? No, I just mean, please don't tell Ted. You wanna try?",77,5629
5629,2,1,Marshall ,"Only hell, yes. Oh yeah, yeah. This is what I needed. I felt so powerless this whole time but this... This is power, this is... (He shoots and falls down)",78,5630
5630,2,1,Robin ,I should have mention the recoil.,79,5631
5631,2,1,Ted ,"I'll hand it to you. When he got home, Marshall was smiling. Did you sleep with him? 'Cause I was actually like three days away from suggesting that.",80,5632
5632,2,1,Robin ,"Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side. (We see Marshall sh**ting and laughing maniacally )",81,5633
5633,2,1,Ted ,"Well, congratulations. You're the first person to cheer him up all summer. You win.",82,5634
5634,2,1,Robin ,Oh! What do I win?,83,5635

5636,2,1,Robin ,You are? That's so nice!,85,5637
5637,2,1,Ted ,"My aunt and uncle have a beach house at Montauk. It's really romantic. My uncle had, like, three affairs there.",86,5638
5638,2,1,Robin ,"Wow, it must be a nice house. I saw pictures of your uncle. This is so great. We'll finally get some time alone. Are you sure Marshall is gonna be OK with this?",87,5639
5639,2,1,Marshall ,"Yeah sure. Absolutely. Dude, I'm doing much better. In fact, take my car.",88,5640
5640,2,1,Ted ,"Really? Hey, thanks. And hey, if you need anything, day or night, just call me. You know what? Please don't call me. What? What's wrong?",89,5641
5641,2,1,Marshall ,It's Lily's credit card bill. She must have forgotten to switch her address.,90,5642
5642,2,1,Ted ,So?,91,5643
5643,2,1,Marshall ,I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there.,92,5644
5644,2,1,Ted ,"No, no. No good can come from looking at this. You've made too much progress already.",93,5645
5645,2,1,Marshall ,"I know, but I just...",94,5646
5646,2,1,Marshall ,"August 5, one charge - tickets. To what? George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars. August 10, one charge, Tennis Emporium. August 18, two charges. Mario's bistro and - get this - Pet Palace. You guys see what it means right?",95,5647

5650,2,1,George Clinton, I am so glad you agreed to play tennis with me.,99,5651
5651,2,1,Lily ,"Oh you know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years but I didn't do it because I never truly loved him.",100,5652
5652,2,1,George Clinton, I got you a gift.,101,5653
5653,2,1,Lily ,"Oh! A ferret. I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace. I've always wanted one, but Marshall have this secret phobia of ferrets.",102,5654
5654,2,1,George Clinton, I bet that's something he made you promise to tell nobody.,103,5655
5655,2,1,Lily ,"It was! Oh, I love you funk legend George Clinton.",104,5656
5656,2,1,George Clinton," I love you too, Lily. That's right Marshall, she's all mine. Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.",105,5657
5657,2,1,Ted ,That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.,106,5658
5658,2,1,Robin ,"Yeah. Why are you afraid of ferrets, they are adorable.",107,5659
5659,2,1,Marshall ,"Because, Robin, they are like fuzzy tube-shaped rats.",108,5660
5660,2,1,Barney ,Those charges are from a month ago.,109,5661
5661,2,1,Ted ,Exactly!,110,5662
5662,2,1,Barney ,"For new charges, you have to go to her online account. You can see credit card activity from like two hours ago. But... You know... Don't... (Marshall leaves the bar, running).",111,5663
5663,2,1,Ted ,Why do you talk? Why do you talk?,112,5664
5664,2,1,Barney ,"He needs her password. Its not like he has her password. Ooh, he has her password. This is... He has her password.",113,5665
5665,2,1,Marshall ,"There is a charge from earlier today. The Kellet Hotel, on Fifth. I don't believe this. Lily is back in New-York. (...) I can't believe this. Lily's in New-York? I guess I'd been thinking when she got back she's call me. That's the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.",114,5666
5666,2,1,Robin (to Ted) ,This has been holding in together?,115,5667
5667,2,1,Marshall ,"OK, you know what? I'm calling her.",116,5668
5668,2,1,Ted ,"No! You're not calling her. This changes nothing. (To Barney) You, come here. (Barney and Robin follow Ted in the kitchen). While we're away this weekend can you keep an eye on him? Make sure he doesn't call her hotel.",117,5669
5669,2,1,Barney ,You want me to baby-sit him? 20 bucks. An hour. And money for pizza.,118,5670
5670,2,1,Ted ,Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this. (To Robin) Come here my little baby. (Ted and Robin are making out),119,5671
5671,2,1,Barney ,"OK, I'll do it! Stop being a couple.",120,5672

5678,2,1,Marshall ,"Ted, I can't hang up now.",127,5679
5679,2,1,Ted ,Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up!,128,5680
5680,2,1,Marshall ,Hello?! (He hangs up) A guy answered. There is... There is a guy in her room. I'm going down there.,129,5681
5681,2,1,Barney ,No!,130,5682
5682,2,1,Ted ,"Dude, you can't...",131,5683
5683,2,1,Marshall ,I have to go down there and I have to tell her I love her. I have to beg to take me back even if I have to tell on my knees.,132,5684
5684,2,1,Robin ,"Marshall, you can't do that!",133,5685
5685,2,1,Marshall ,Really? Why not?,134,5686
5686,2,1,,Ted from 2030: 56 days. That's how long it took me to get right about here.,135,5687
5687,2,1,Ted ,"Because you're pathetic! I'm sorry. But right now, you are not Marshall. You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily. You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line? Marshall. The real Marshall. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car?",136,5688
5688,2,1,Barney ,Bold. Bold to go for the car.,137,5689
5689,2,1,Ted ,What?,138,5690
5690,2,1,Robin ,I didn't say a thing.,139,5691
5691,2,1,Ted ,You think I was too hard on him.,140,5692
5692,2,1,Robin ,I didn't say a thing.,141,5693
5693,2,1,Ted ,I can't believe you're accusing me to be too hard on him. You're the one who said tough love.,142,5694
5694,2,1,Robin ,"Yeah, tough love, not hand the guy a noose.",143,5695
5695,2,1,Ted ,"Oh, but it's OK to hand him a 9 mm? Yeah. He told me. So you're a g*n nut?",144,5696
5696,2,1,Robin ,"No, I'm a g*n enthusiast.",145,5697
5697,2,1,Ted ,Do you know how many people are k*lled...,146,5698
5698,2,1,Robin ,The Second Amendment protects my right to bear arms...,147,5699
5699,2,1,Ted ,"Alright, alright. I was too hard on him.",148,5700

5709,2,1,Barney ,He's gone.,158,5710
5710,2,1,Ted ,You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel.,159,5711
5711,2,1,Barney ,"Crap, you're right. OK, here is the plan. Here is the plan. You go down to the hotel and find him. I'll stay here and get a lap dance. Bye Ted!",160,5712
5712,2,1,Ted ,Barney![End of the phone call],161,5713

5719,2,1,,"Marshall:...and I had this little speech in my head. Everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect. I knocked on the door. (A man is opening the door and Marshall is punching him in the face).",168,5720
5720,2,1,Ted ,You knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?,169,5721
5721,2,1,Marshall ,Yeah. It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.,170,5722
5722,2,1,Ted ,What? Who was he?,171,5723
5723,2,1,,"Ted from 2030: His name was Joey Adalian. He went by a number of aliases as an identity thief. Apparently, earlier in the summer...",172,5724
5724,2,1,Lily ,"Oh, this is so embarrassing. I could've sworn I have some change. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Oh, here we go. No that's, that's a button... It was a button. Do you take credit cards?",173,5725
5725,2,1,,"Waiter/Joey Adalian: Yes, I do.[End of flashback]",174,5726
5726,2,1,Ted ,"So Lily is not back in town and she doesn't have a boyfriend. That's good news, right?",175,5727
5727,2,1,Marshall ,Yeah. I don't know. Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her. I don't know where she is or what she's doing. She was my whole life man and now she's... She's gone.,176,5728
5728,2,1,Ted ,"You know, first day at college, I showed up, I was so freaked out and I got up to my room and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall. He had headphones on, a big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap. Happy. Confident. Not afraid of anything. That guy was you. You before you met Lily.",177,5729
5729,2,1,Marshall ,Ted.,178,5730

5732,2,1,Ted ,"What I'm saying is, there's a version of you without Lily and... It's not this. You can't let Lily stole your identity the way that guy stole hers.",181,5733
5733,2,1,Marshall ,"OK.OK! Resolved. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being OK. Cheers.",182,5734
5734,2,1,Ted ,Cheers.,183,5735
5735,2,1,,"DAY FIFTY-SEVEN, at the apartment.Ted from 2030: But it wasn't. 'cause that's no how life works. The next day he found one of her socks or something and we were back to square one. And then, one morning...",184,5736

5738,2,1,Marshall ,It's Sunday. It's pancakes day.,187,5739
5739,2,1,,"Ted from 2030: It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes, but Marshall had come back from the dead. Because while baseball, strippers and g*ns can help, the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.",188,5740
5740,2,2,,"Ted from 2030: Marshall and Lily have together for nine wonderful years until she dumped him and ran off to San Francisco. The healing process was taking a long time. Then, one night he made a giant leap forward.",1,5741

6041,2,3,Marshall ,You went to San Francisco for three months.,70,6042
6042,2,3,Lily ,How is that seducing you?,71,6043

6151,2,3,Robin ,But this is the first time she's meeting me.,180,6152
6152,2,3,Ted ,Doesn't matter. And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin Stacy: six kids in five years. The woman's basically a ride at a water park.,181,6153
6153,2,3,Robin ,But I don't want to get married and have kids. What am I supposed to say?,182,6154
6154,2,3,Ted ,You know what? You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions. You shouldn't have to apologize for them.,183,6155

6232,2,3,Marshall ,I just find it really confusing to be around you right now.,261,6233

6242,2,3,Ted ,"No, this is ridiculous! We have to start talking about stuff, and not just baseball.",271,6243
6243,2,3,Ted's father, Indians won today on a walk-off double.,272,6244
6244,2,3,Ted ,"Against the Red Sox? Boy, that's a big win. No. No. No. We're not gonna blow past this. I mean, I don't even know who you people. I don't even know how you met.",273,6245

6246,2,3,Ted ,No.,275,6247
6247,2,3,Ted's father," Oh, great story. At a bar.",276,6248
6248,2,3,Ted ,"That's it? That's what passes for communication in our family? Man, when I have kids, and I tell them how I met their mother, I'm gonna tell them everything, the whole damn story.",277,6249
6249,2,3,Ted's father, I think it was an Irish bar.,278,6250
6250,2,3,Ted ,"I just, I don't... I don't understand. You seemed so happy. When I was growing up, you seemed so... What happened?",279,6251
6251,2,3,Ted's father, We just realized we're very different people.,280,6252
6252,2,3,Ted's mother," Your father's kind of a head-in-the-clouds romantic, and I'm much more down to earth.",281,6253
6253,2,3,Ted ,So? Robin and I are like that. That doesn't mean anything.,282,6254
6254,2,3,Ted's father, I wanted kids. And your mother... also wanted kids.,283,6255
6255,2,3,Ted ,Robin and I have different views on families. We're not about to break up because of it.,284,6256
6256,2,3,Ted's mother," On some level, I always knew. I didn't even want to go out with him in the beginning. But he spent months badgering me until I finally gave in.",285,6257
6257,2,3,Ted's father," Well, when you don't connect on that many fundamental levels, it's only a matter of time before you realize you're not meant to be together.",286,6258
6258,2,3,Ted's mother, But we love Robin.,287,6259
6259,2,3,Ted's father," Absolutely. Meeting you was the highlight of my trip. Well, second highlight.",288,6260
6260,2,3,Ted's mother, We'll see you inside.,289,6261
6261,2,3,Ted's father, Sorry.,290,6262
6262,2,3,Robin ,Wow.,291,6263
6263,2,3,Ted ,I know.,292,6264
6264,2,3,Robin ,They love me!,293,6265
6265,2,3,,"Back inside, later.Ted's mother: So we are definitely going to try and communicate more.",294,6266
6266,2,3,Ted's father," From now on, full disclosure.",295,6267
6267,2,3,Ted ,"Good. Good, I think it'll be really good for the family. By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't returned my last couple calls.",296,6268
6268,2,3,Ted's mother, I'm gonna get some juice.,297,6269
6269,2,3,Ted ,No. No.,298,6270
6270,2,3,Ted's father, You missed a great game last night. Real squeaker.,299,6271
6271,2,4,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, sometimes your relationship goes so smoothly for so long that you think it will be that way forever. It never is.",1,6272
6272,2,4,Ted ,"Well, we just had our first fight.",2,6273
6273,2,4,Robin ,We had our first fight.,3,6274
6274,2,4,Barney ,"Oh, no, what'd you fight about? (He puts his headphones on).",4,6275
6275,2,4,Ted ,"A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building...",5,6276
6276,2,4,Robin ,It's this big skyscraper in Spokane. It'd be a huge project for his firm.,6,6277
6277,2,4,Ted ,"And if we don't get it, we could go under.",7,6278
6278,2,4,Robin ,"So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company.",8,6279
6279,2,4,,Both Marshall and Barney: No.,9,6280
6280,2,4,Ted ,Yes.,10,6281
6281,2,4,Marshall ,"Well, all skyscrapers kind of look like a...",11,6282
6282,2,4,Ted ,"Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front.",12,6283
6283,2,4,Marshall ,"Wow, so it's the whole package.",13,6284
6284,2,4,Barney ,"Yeah, you did.",14,6285
6285,2,4,Marshall ,Had to.,15,6286
6286,2,4,Barney ,"Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft.",16,6287
6287,2,4,Marshall ,"Yeah, you did.",17,6288
6288,2,4,Barney ,Had to.,18,6289
6289,2,4,Ted ,"It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices.",19,6290
6290,2,4,Marshall ,"Yeah, you did.",20,6291
6291,2,4,Ted ,That wasn't one.,21,6292
6292,2,4,Lily ,"So you and Ted had your first fight. It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me.",22,6293
6293,2,4,Robin ,"Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm.",23,6294
6294,2,4,Lily ,"Ooh, two tragedies in one day.",24,6295
6295,2,4,Robin ,"The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done.",25,6296
6296,2,4,Ted ,Hey.,26,6297
6297,2,4,Robin ,Hey.,27,6298
6298,2,4,Ted ,How was your day?,28,6299
6299,2,4,Robin ,Good.,29,6300
6300,2,4,Ted ,"Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was?",30,6301
6301,2,4,Robin ,"No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight?",31,6302
6302,2,4,Ted ,"You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time.",32,6303
6303,2,4,Robin ,"Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter.",33,6304
6304,2,4,Lily ,Robin!,34,6305
6305,2,4,Robin ,What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster.,35,6306
6306,2,4,Lily ,You should work at a su1c1de hotline.,36,6307
6307,2,4,Robin ,And then it got ugly.,37,6308
6308,2,4,Robin ,"What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like Die Hard. But Field of Dreams? Once is more than enough.",38,6309
6309,2,4,Ted ,So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is Field of Dreams?,39,6310
6310,2,4,Robin ,It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid.,40,6311
6311,2,4,Robin ,"So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie.",41,6312
6312,2,4,Lily ,"Robin, he's upset because you wouldn't listen to him, not because you didn't like some movie.",42,6313
6313,2,4,Ted ,How do you not like Field of Dreams?!,43,6314
6314,2,4,Lily ,"Listening is the foundation of a relationship. And if he's really droning on, you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards. You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI.",44,6315
6315,2,4,Robin ,I guess I don't know how to do that.,45,6316
6316,2,4,Lily ,"Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober. That's what I tried to explain to the cop.",46,6317
6317,2,4,Robin ,"No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?",47,6318
6318,2,4,Lily ,"What the hell comes before ""Q""?",48,6319
6319,2,4,Ted ,"Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.",49,6320
6320,2,4,Barney (brokenly) ,Can we talk about something else?,50,6321
6321,2,4,Marshall ,"You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up.",51,6322
6322,2,4,Barney ,"Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?",52,6323
6323,2,4,Marshall ,"That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck.",53,6324
6324,2,4,Barney ,"Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.",54,6325
6325,2,4,Ted ,"I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job.",55,6326
6326,2,4,Marshall ,Your job's not boring.,56,6327
6327,2,4,Ted ,Robin thinks so.,57,6328
6328,2,4,Barney ,"Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God.",58,6329
6329,2,4,Ted ,I love it when you quote Scripture.,59,6330
6330,2,4,Barney ,"I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.",60,6331
6331,2,4,Ted ,"Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.",61,6332
6332,2,4,Barney ,"That's 'cause you're always like... (Dully) ""Ted Mosby, architect"". If it were me, I'd be like... (Confidently) ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude.",62,6333
6333,2,4,Marshall (suavely) ,"Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off..",63,6334
6334,2,4,Barney ,"Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Trust me.",64,6335
6335,2,4,Ted ,"Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that?",65,6336
6336,2,4,Girl ,Are you kidding? Architects are hot. How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?,66,6337
6337,2,4,Ted ,Solid point. She did have hair of gold.,67,6338
6338,2,4,Girl ,"Yes, she did.",68,6339
6339,2,4,Ted ,Mm-hmm.,69,6340
6340,2,4,Robin ,"Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?",70,6341
6341,2,4,Carl ,"No. Hey, Lily. You still single?",71,6342
6342,2,4,Lily ,Yes.,72,6343
6343,2,4,Carl ,You know... I've poured a lot of free drinks for you over the years. A lot.,73,6344
6344,2,4,Lily ,"Carl, do you really want to be with a woman who would trade s*x for beer?",74,6345
6345,2,4,Carl ,Only if you're into it. It's on me.,75,6346
6346,2,4,Lily ,Thanks.,76,6347
6347,2,4,Robin ,I wonder where Ted went.,77,6348
6348,2,4,A girl," Ted Mosby, the architect?",78,6349
6349,2,4,Robin ,"Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier.",79,6350
6350,2,4,Girl 1, And what made you decide you wanted to become an architect?,80,6351
6351,2,4,Ted ,"Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess.",81,6352
6352,2,4,Girl 1," I bet you can draw, can't you? You should draw me.",82,6353
6353,2,4,Ted ,"Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to. Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right?",83,6354
6354,2,4,Girls ,Yeah.,84,6355
6355,2,4,Lily ,"He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay?",85,6356
6356,2,4,Robin ,"Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part.",86,6357
6357,2,4,Lily ,"What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out.",87,6358
6358,2,4,Robin ,"I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat.",88,6359
6359,2,4,Girl ,She's a kickboxing instructor. Her ass looks better than my face.,89,6360
6360,2,4,Robin ,"All right, we'll swing by the party.",90,6361
6361,2,4,,"Ted from 2030: Now the party was for some of Marshall's classmates from Columbia Law School, who by day were some of the sharpest and most serious young legal minds in the country. By night, however...",91,6362
6362,2,4,Robin ,"Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers.",92,6363
6363,2,4,Guy 1, Okay! Seriously... Who wants to shave my ass?!,93,6364
6364,2,4,,Ted from 2030: That guy went on to become a Supreme Court justice.,94,6365
6365,2,4,Lily ,"Okay, where are the guys and the hooker?",95,6366
6366,2,4,Guy 2," Yo, what's up, ladies? Welcome to the party. Yeah! Just need you to sign this release protecting the host from any and all responsibility should you harm yourself or a third party. Then freakin' rage! Yeah!",96,6367
6367,2,4,Robin ,"Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted.",97,6368
6368,2,4,Guy 2," You mean Ted Mosby, the architect? Man, what a visionary. Yeah, they were here.",98,6369
6369,2,4,Ted ,"Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.",99,6370
6370,2,4,Girl ,Wow. I would love to watch the sun rise with you.,100,6371
6371,2,4,Ted ,I know you would. It's the job.,101,6372
6372,2,4,,Guy 2 (to guy 1): Dude. You should let us shave your ass tonight.,102,6373
6373,2,4,Guy 1, No way.,103,6374
6374,2,4,Girl 2," Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?",104,6375
6375,2,4,Marshall ,"I didn't want to ruin the party for everybody this early, but, uh... everyone take a seat. Um... Lily actually called off the wedding this summer to go to San Francisco. So... We're broken up.",105,6376
6376,2,4,Guy 2," Her name wasn't on your lease, was it? 'Cause if not, New York state law, you're not obligated to give her half the deposit when you move.",106,6377
6377,2,4,Marshall ,"Yeah, that's not really the part I was worried about, guys.",107,6378
6378,2,4,Girl 2," And don't forget the precedent set by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74. Any personal effects she left in your house or dwelling become yours after 30 days.",108,6379
6379,2,4,Marshall ,"Guys, can we cease and desist with the lawyer speak for a minute? Love died. The love that made you all believe in love, that's dead now.",109,6380
6380,2,4,Girl 2, You should sue her.,110,6381
6381,2,4,Marshall ,"Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?",111,6382
6382,2,4,Kara ,On the grounds of... shut up.,112,6383
6383,2,4,,Ted from 2030: That's our Attorney General.,113,6384
6384,2,4,Lily ,See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup. Why? Because I listened to him. It was a strong and nurturing relationship that I threw away like old gum.,114,6385
6385,2,4,Robin ,"Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her?",115,6386
6386,2,4,Guy 2, The girl with the smackable ass.,116,6387
6387,2,4,Robin ,"Yes, that's the young lady.",117,6388
6388,2,4,Girl ,"So, I know the bouncer at this techno club, Posers. Do you feel like dancing?",118,6389
6389,2,4,Robin ,"Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing. Ted hates clubs.",119,6390
6390,2,4,Ted ,"Hell, yeah. I love clubs. I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight, kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum. But sure, let's go dancing.",120,6391
6391,2,4,Girl ,Yay!,121,6392
6392,2,4,Ted ,"Wait, let me just check with my friend.",122,6393
6393,2,4,Girl ,Okay.,123,6394
6394,2,4,Ted ,"Hey, Marshall. You up for some super loud, repetitive music that hasn't changed since the mid-90s?",124,6395
6395,2,4,Marshall ,Um... only always.,125,6396
6396,2,4,Ted ,Let's go.,126,6397
6397,2,4,Robin ,"Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to s*x.",127,6398
6398,2,4,Lily ,Did you grow up in that Footloose town?,128,6399
6399,2,4,Robin ,"I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories.",129,6400
6400,2,4,Lily ,"Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine.",130,6401
6401,2,4,Robin ,He's not answering. Calling Marshall.,131,6402
6402,2,4,Marshall ,Hello.,132,6403
6403,2,4,Robin ,"Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted?",133,6404
6404,2,4,Marshall ,"Oh, Robin, hi. Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. He's, uh... he's working.",134,6405
6405,2,4,Robin ,"Uh, okay. Bye. (She hangs up) Marshall just lied. Ted's cheating on me.",135,6406
6406,2,4,Robin ,"Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier. One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair. And the other's a cheating b*st*rd.",136,6407
6407,2,4,Bouncer ,You're going to need to refresh my memory.,137,6408
6408,2,4,Lily ,"Okay, fella. Baby knows how this game's played. How's a $20 help your memory?",138,6409
6409,2,4,Bouncer ,"Thanks, but seriously, it was crazy tonight. You really do need to refresh my memory.",139,6410
6410,2,4,Lily ,Then can I have the...? That's cool. You keep that.,140,6411
6411,2,4,Robin ,So these guys... One of them's an architect.,141,6412
6412,2,4,Bouncer ,"Ted Mosby, the architect?",142,6413
6413,2,4,Robin ,That's the one.,143,6414
6414,2,4,Bouncer ,"Oh, yeah, he was here.",144,6415
6415,2,4,Ted ,"And then I was all, ""No, Frank Gehry, you're on your own this time."" And that, my dear, was the end of that hack's career.",145,6416
6416,2,4,Girl ,I live across the street.,146,6417
6417,2,4,Ted ,That is one hell of a non sequitur.,147,6418
6418,2,4,Girl ,You want to come over?,148,6419
6419,2,4,Ted ,"Well, I don't know. But I suppose I should at least give you a ride home. Hop on. (The girl jumps on Ted's back)",149,6420
6420,2,4,Girl (to the bouncer) ,"I'll see you at book club, Vinny.",150,6421
6421,2,4,Bouncer ,Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudités.,151,6422
6422,2,4,Girl ,Nice. Giddy up!,152,6423
6423,2,4,Marshall ,"Dude, dude, what are you doing?",153,6424
6424,2,4,Ted ,Galloping.,154,6425
6425,2,4,Marshall ,"You proved it, all right? The whole ""Ted Mosby, architect"" things works.",155,6426
6426,2,4,Girl ,Architects rule! Whoo-hee!,156,6427
6427,2,4,Marshall ,"Aren't you a little worried that a certain somebody might find out that you're doing this? This isn't you, Ted.",157,6428
6428,2,4,Ted ,It is tonight. Whoo!,158,6429
6429,2,4,Robin ,You know this girl. Where does she live?,159,6430
6430,2,4,Bouncer ,I'm not telling you that for less than 20 bucks.,160,6431
6431,2,4,Lily ,"Well, I'm out of money.",161,6432
6432,2,4,Robin ,"I'm cashed, too.",162,6433
6433,2,4,Bouncer ,I'll take your purse.,163,6434
6434,2,4,Robin ,My purse?,164,6435
6435,2,4,Bouncer ,"Yeah, my girl likes clutches.",165,6436
6436,2,4,Robin ,"Okay, fine.",166,6437
6437,2,4,Lily ,You should tell her that looks really good with a chocolate boot.,167,6438
6438,2,4,Robin ,Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse. No room for my g*n. Here. Now where does the rodeo slut live?,168,6439
6439,2,4,Bouncer ,"The building with the green light, apartment 3-C.",169,6440
6440,2,4,Lily ,"Oh, my God, Robin, are you going to kick this girl's ass?",170,6441
6441,2,4,Robin ,Yeah... And steal her purse.,171,6442
6442,2,4,Robin ,"I can't believe he's cheating on me. You know how many times I could have cheated? Six... no seven. And you know two of them, and they would surprise you.",172,6443
6443,2,4,Lily ,"3-C, let's do this. You ready?",173,6444
6444,2,4,Robin ,Should I just kick the door in?,174,6445
6445,2,4,Lily ,"Those are really nice heels and you already lost the purse. Let's see if it's unlocked. It's unlocked. Okay, get in there and kick some spankable ass. Robin?",175,6446
6446,2,4,Robin ,I'm the problem.,176,6447
6447,2,4,Lily ,What?,177,6448
6448,2,4,Robin ,You were right. I don't know how to be a girlfriend. I took the nicest guy in the world and I made him a cheater.,178,6449
6449,2,4,Lily ,"Well, don't stand out here and beat yourself up. Get in there and beat Ted up. I'll handle the slutty kickboxer. Actually, I'll take Ted.",179,6450
6450,2,4,Robin ,Let's do this.,180,6451
6451,2,4,Lily ,Bring it. (They come in),181,6452
6452,2,4,Robin ,What do you think you're...? Barney?,182,6453
6453,2,4,Barney (tied up to the bed) ,Thank God you're here. Can you help with this? I need nails.,183,6454
6454,2,4,Robin ,"Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?",184,6455
6455,2,4,Barney ,Ted? He's at work.,185,6456
6456,2,4,Robin ,How did you get here?,186,6457
6457,2,4,Barney ,Awesome story. As per usual.,187,6458
6458,2,4,Girl ,How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?,188,6459
6459,2,4,Ted ,Solid point. And she did have hair of gold.,189,6460
6460,2,4,Girl ,"Yes, she did.",190,6461
6461,2,4,Barney (coming back in the bar) ,"Sorry, I forgot my binocs for Foxy Boxing. Whoo, looks like things just got a little foxier right here.",191,6462
6462,2,4,Ted ,"Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands.",192,6463
6463,2,4,Girl ,Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings.,193,6464
6464,2,4,Barney ,"Yeah, stay (mouthing ""go"")",194,6465
6465,2,4,Ted ,"Excuse us for one second. (To Barney) Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder.",195,6466
6466,2,4,Barney ,"Yeah, you did.",196,6467
6467,2,4,Ted ,"Yeah, had to. See ya. (He leaves)",197,6468
6468,2,4,Barney (to the girl) ,"Sorry, my, uh... intern had to leave.",198,6469
6469,2,4,Girl ,"Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way.",199,6470
6470,2,4,Barney ,Ted Mosby... Architect.,200,6471
6471,2,4,Barney ,But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.,201,6472
6472,2,4,Anna ,"Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up!",202,6473
6473,2,4,Marshall ,"Dude, dude, what are you doing?",203,6474
6474,2,4,Barney ,Galloping.,204,6475
6475,2,4,Marshall ,"All right, you proved it. The whole ""Ted Mosby, architect"" thing works.",205,6476
6476,2,4,Anna ,Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.,206,6477
6477,2,4,Marshall ,"Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted.",207,6478
6478,2,4,Barney ,It is tonight.,208,6479
6479,2,4,Barney ,"And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here.",209,6480
6480,2,4,Robin ,But why would you use Ted's name?,210,6481
6481,2,4,Barney ,"I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole ""using my real name"" thing.",211,6482
6482,2,4,Lily ,"Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.",212,6483
6483,2,4,Robin ,Everything isn't okay. Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid.,213,6484
6484,2,4,Lily ,This is how people act in relationships.,214,6485
6485,2,4,Robin ,And that's why I avoid relationships.,215,6486
6486,2,4,Lily ,"Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it.",216,6487
6487,2,4,Barney ,"And thus ended this chapter of, ""Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand."" Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower.",217,6488
6488,2,4,Robin ,You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?,218,6489
6489,2,4,Barney ,"I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a ""A."" A... A... I'll just put ""resident."" Go, go, go, go.",219,6490
6490,2,4,,Ted from 2030: Robin took a long walk that night. She thought about how opening yourself up to another person usually means opening yourself up to going a little crazy. She thought about how much easier it was just to be alone. And then she came to see me.,220,6491
6491,2,4,Robin ,Hey.,221,6492
6492,2,4,Ted ,Hey. What are you doing here?,222,6493
6493,2,4,Robin ,"I brought donuts. And I don't want to brag, but they're filled with jelly.",223,6494
6494,2,4,Ted ,"Thanks. So, uh... how was your night?",224,6495
6495,2,4,Robin ,It was... fine. Nothing exciting. How was yours?,225,6496
6496,2,4,Ted ,You really want to hear about boring architect stuff?,226,6497
6497,2,4,Robin ,"Yes, I do. I'm sorry about earlier. To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of Field of Dreams. I fell asleep half way through.",227,6498
6498,2,4,Ted ,What? The best part's the last 20 minutes.,228,6499
6499,2,4,Robin ,"Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause... You know what, um... What I'm trying to say is... I love being the person you bitch to. So how was your day, Mr. Architect?",229,6500
6500,2,4,Ted ,"Oh, I like the way you say that. Hey, you want to see the building that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate?",230,6501
6501,2,4,Robin ,Obviously. Wow.,231,6502
6502,2,4,Ted ,Yes.,232,6503
6503,2,4,Robin ,"You know, you didn't mention all the foliage around the base. If you trim that back, the rest would look bigger.",233,6504
6504,2,4,Ted ,"You don't have to tell me. And, um... just for fun, I've... I've sort of been working on my own idea of what I think the building should be. What do you think?",234,6505
6505,2,4,,Ted from 2030: You know that time we went to Spokane and I pointed out that skyscraper? That was the first building I ever designed. And that night was the first time I showed anyone my first drawing of it.,235,6506
6506,2,4,Robin ,"Wow. Ted, this is amazing.",236,6507
6507,2,4,Ted ,Thanks. It's not like it will ever come to anything.,237,6508
6508,2,4,Robin ,"I don't know. It might come to something. You know, girls find architects very hot. (They kiss)",238,6509
6509,2,4,Ted ,"Okay, but I don't want you expecting 78 storeys or anything. (They kiss again)",239,6510

I would love to see you again, but unfortunately, I cannot. You see, I am a ghost. I can't only materialize once every decade on the anniversary of my death. I chose to spend my one day among the living with you, sweet... Resident. Perhaps we will meet again in another decade, provided you keep your figure. Until then, all my love from the beyond.

6520,2,5,Robin ,Or a stove in your bathroom?,9,6521

6526,2,5,Lily ,"That was ""something, something, I am going to something you like a something donkey.",15,6527

6632,2,5,Barney ,She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment... Except you. You're better than p*rn.,121,6633
6633,2,5,Lily ,Thank you.,122,6634
6634,2,5,Barney ,"How would you like to extend your stay here? All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife, and scare off the occasional one-night stand. I know,I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles...",123,6635

6636,2,5,Barney ,Really?,125,6637
6637,2,5,Lily ,"Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win.",126,6638

6649,2,5,Robin ,"Sounds like Brad's got quite the night planned out. You better bring your ""A"" game. That means no granny panties.",138,6650
6650,2,5,Marshall ,"All right, you know what? You two are just threatened because I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' stuff. Well, guess what? It's my territory now. I'm peeing all over brunches, fancy dinners and musicals. That's right. Brad and I are taking back Broadway.",139,6651
6651,2,5,Ted ,What are you going to wear?,140,6652
6652,2,5,Marshall ,"I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin... (Ted and Robin laugh) Oh, you know what? Shut up.",141,6653
6653,2,5,Barney ,Can you pass the arts and leisure? (The girl does it. More loudly) Can you pass the arts and leisure?,142,6654
6654,2,5,Girl ,I just did.,143,6655
6655,2,5,Lily (walking in) ,"Honey, I'm... Barney, what the hell is going on here?",144,6656
6656,2,5,Barney ,"Lily, I can explain...",145,6657
6657,2,5,Lily ,How could you? In our own home? (She slaps him) You b*st*rd!,146,6658
6658,2,5,Girl ,I'm so sorry. I-i didn't know he had...,147,6659
6659,2,5,Lily ,Just get out. This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years to put you through medical school? I got breast implants for you. I... (The girl is gone) I was just about to turn on the tears.,148,6660
6660,2,5,Barney ,Brava. That was incredible. And that slap was genius. You did not hold back.,149,6661
6661,2,5,Lily ,"Yeah, that I just always wanted to do.",150,6662
6662,2,5,Barney ,"Fair enough. I have to say, it's kind of nice having food around here for a change.",151,6663
6663,2,5,Lily ,"You know... Oh nah, never mind.",152,6664
6664,2,5,Barney ,What? You're my wife. You can tell me anything.,153,6665
6665,2,5,Lily ,"Well,if you really wanted to sell this ruse, we should try to make this place a little more... You know, homey. Like... Like a woman would actually live here.",154,6666
6666,2,5,Barney ,What did you have in mind?,155,6667
6667,2,5,Ted ,"Hey,you're home. I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning.",156,6668
6668,2,5,Marshall ,"Ha,ha,ha,ha. It wasn't a date. Okay, it was a date and it got way weird.",157,6669
6669,2,5,Marshall ,"Oh, you really don't have to do that.",158,6670
6670,2,5,Brad ,"No, I insist. You're my guest.",159,6671
6671,2,5,Marshall ,"Thanks, Brad.",160,6672
6672,2,5,Brad ,Bro. You got some chocolate on your chin. Still there. I'll get that bad boy. (He licks his serviette and cleans Marshall's chin),161,6673
6673,2,5,Ted ,Woah!,162,6674
6674,2,5,Robin ,"Well, it could have been worse. It could have fallen in your lap.",163,6675
6675,2,5,Marshall ,It gets worse.,164,6676
6676,2,5,Marshall ,"No, I can do it, Brad. Okay,thank you.",165,6677
6677,2,5,Brad ,"So anyway,ah,it's this Saturday. Do you want to come?",166,6678
6678,2,5,Marshall ,You want me to go to a wedding with you?,167,6679
6679,2,5,Ted ,"Okay, that's not too bad. Two single guys on the prowl. It'll be like ""Wedding crashers"".",168,6680
6680,2,5,Robin ,Just keep Brad away from the bouquet.,169,6681
6681,2,5,Marshall ,It gets worse.,170,6682
6682,2,5,Brad ,It gets better.The foliage in Vermont this time of year is ridonc.,171,6683
6683,2,5,Marshall ,Vermont?,172,6684
6684,2,5,Brad ,"Yeah,the wedding's at this awesome B&B. Kara and I used to go there. Anyway, there is one room left,and we got it. Walt Whitman Suite, bro.",173,6685
6685,2,5,Ted ,"You said no, right?",174,6686
6686,2,5,Marshall ,Of course.,175,6687
6687,2,5,Brad ,I understand. It's cool. It's the first time I was going to see my college friends since Kara left me. I just... I just miss her so much. (Brad starts sobbing),176,6688
6688,2,5,Marshall ,I'll go to Vermont with you.,177,6689
6689,2,5,Brad ,"That's great! You know, uh, they're registered at Pottery Barn. I figure we could go halfsies on a gravy boat.",178,6690
6690,2,5,Ted ,I'm sorry. It's not funny anymore.,179,6691
6691,2,5,Marshall ,"Damn you,brunch! This guy's crazy, right?",180,6692
6692,2,5,Ted ,"Look,I don't think he's crazy. I just think he's suffering from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal. And unfortunately, you're his nicotine patch.",181,6693
6693,2,5,Robin ,And now you have to do what every dysfunctional couple has to do: Break up.,182,6694
6694,2,5,Marshall ,"You're right. You're right. I promised brad I would go to the wedding with him,and then that is it.",183,6695
6695,2,5,Ted ,Good man.,184,6696
6696,2,5,Lily ,"Oh,I think we made the right decision going for the custom-made italian sheets.",185,6697
6697,2,5,Barney ,"Hey, if my bed's going suit up, it's going to do it right. Want to give it a whirl?",186,6698
6698,2,5,Lily (jumping on the bed) ,Oh. Ooooh!,187,6699
6699,2,5,Barney ,"All right, I'm going to head out, hit the bars. What are you going to do tonight?",188,6700
6700,2,5,Lily ,"Oh, I was just going to watch ""Letterman"" but, God this bed is so comfy. I wish you had a TV in here. (Barney turns on a another wall-size TV) Okay, seriously, what do you do for a living?",189,6701
6701,2,5,Barney ,Please. (He settles himself on the bed),190,6702
6702,2,5,Lily ,I thought you were going out.,191,6703
6703,2,5,Barney ,Eh. After the monologue.,192,6704
6704,2,5,,"Ted (from 2030): The next morning, as the sun rose over Manhattan, your Uncle Marshall headed over to Brad's apartment to leave for the wedding in Vermont. But when he got there...",193,6705
6705,2,5,Marshall ,"No. No... No. No! No! (On the phone) Ted. Um, Brad got me flowers.",194,6706
6706,2,5,Ted ,Hold on. (To Robin) Brad got him flowers. (They laugh) I'm sorry. It just got funny again. (Marshall hangs up),195,6707
6707,2,5,Brad ,"Oh, hey...",196,6708
6708,2,5,Marshall ,"No, Brad, uh, I don't want to hear it. I do like you. And calla lilies are my favorite flower. I don't know how you knew that. I guess you just get me, but this is not cool, man. I can't believe that you would...",197,6709
6709,2,5,Girl ,"Hey,sweetie.",198,6710
6710,2,5,Brad ,Hey. (They kiss and Brad give her the flowers),199,6711
6711,2,5,Girl ,"Aww. Hey, Marshall.",200,6712
6712,2,5,Marshall ,"Hi, Kara. So you guys,are like back together now?",201,6713
6713,2,5,Brad ,"Yeah. Happened last night. Uh, I'm sorry, bro. I should have called you.",202,6714
6714,2,5,Marshall ,"Yeah, you should have.",203,6715
6715,2,5,Brad ,"Well, I didn't mean to hurt...",204,6716
6716,2,5,Marshall ,"Don't, Brad. Just don't. (He leaves)",205,6717
6717,2,5,Kara ,"Oh, what was with him?",206,6718
6718,2,5,Brad ,I don't know. I think he's in love with me.,207,6719
6719,2,5,Barney ,Aaaaaah!,208,6720
6720,2,5,Lily ,Aaaaaaaaaaah!,209,6721
6721,2,5,Barney ,I can't believe we just... You and I... What have we done?,210,6722
6722,2,5,Lily ,Nothing. Nothing happened. We... We just went to sleep.,211,6723
6723,2,5,Barney ,"""Just went to sleep""? I don't sleep in the same bed as a woman and not make a move. How could... You! You spooned me against my will.",212,6724
6724,2,5,Lily ,"Hey,it takes two to cuddle.",213,6725
6725,2,5,Barney ,"We... We redecorated my place. We stayed in on a friday night to watch ""Letterman"", and then slept together and didn't have s*x? Oh my God! We're in a relationship!",214,6726
6726,2,5,Lily ,That's what you think a relationship is?,215,6727
6727,2,5,Barney ,"You were supposed to be the vaccine, but you gave me the disease. You gotta go.",216,6728
6728,2,5,Lily ,"Barney. I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself. You let down your guard, and let someone into your life, and... And it actually felt okay. And that terrifies you.",217,6729
6729,2,5,Barney ,Uh-uh. You gotta go.,218,6730
6730,2,5,Lily ,"Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place, and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living.",219,6731
6731,2,5,Barney ,"""A certain standard of living""? You didn't pay a single...",220,6732
6732,2,5,,"Ted (from 2030): And so Mr. and Mrs. Stinson, after two weeks of marriage, decided to call it quits. Fortunately, they reached a settlement. And that's the story of how Aunt Lily furnished her apartment.",221,6733
6733,2,5,,Ted (from 2030): Marshall ran into Brad again some time later.,222,6734
6734,2,5,Marshall ,"Oh my God, it's Brad. Laugh like I said something really funny. (Ted laughs)",223,6735
6735,2,5,Ted ,That was great.,224,6736
6736,2,5,Marshall ,Right? Right?,225,6737
6737,2,5,Brad ,"Hey, Marshall.",226,6738
6738,2,5,Marshall ,"Oh, hey, hey, how's it going?",227,6739
6739,2,5,Brad ,"It's good. (To ted) Hey, I'm uh...",228,6740
6740,2,5,Ted ,"Yeah, I know who you are.",229,6741
6741,2,5,Brad ,"Well,I got to go. I got this thing.",230,6742
6742,2,5,Marshall ,"Yeah, me too, but more important.",231,6743
6743,2,5,Brad ,"So, I guess I'll see you around.",232,6744
6744,2,5,Marshall ,"Sure. Sure. (Brad leaves) Even if you don't believe it, tell me he looks fat.",233,6745
6745,2,5,Ted ,Totally looks fat.,234,6746
6746,2,6,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when you reach your late twenty, you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out. Like with aunt Lily. Even though she was back from San Francisco, she was still on a quest to find herself.",1,6747
6747,2,6,Lily ,It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.,2,6748
6748,2,6,,Ted from 2030: And she did find it.,3,6749
6749,2,6,,Lily (coming in Robin's): I'm going to be a life coach.,4,6750
6750,2,6,,"Ted from 2030: In fact, she found it again and again.",5,6751
6751,2,6,Lily ,I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.,6,6752
6752,2,6,Robin (on the phone) ,Her newest lifelong dream? Singing in a punk rock band.,7,6753
6753,2,6,Ted ,What is she doing for money through all this?,8,6754
6754,2,6,Robin ,"Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.",9,6755
6755,2,6,Ted ,"Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?",10,6756
6756,2,6,Robin ,No.,11,6757
6757,2,6,Marshall ,Here she comes. Here she comes.,12,6758
6758,2,6,Lily ,"Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.",13,6759
6759,2,6,Robin ,I'm sorry.,14,6760
6760,2,6,Barney ,"Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. (Marshall takes a photo of her).",15,6761
6761,2,6,Lily ,What do you want?,16,6762
6762,2,6,Ted ,I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.,17,6763
6763,2,6,Lily ,"Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.",18,6764
6764,2,6,Barney ,I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?,19,6765
6765,2,6,Ted ,No.,20,6766
6766,2,6,Lily ,"My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.",21,6767
6767,2,6,Ted ,"Robin, nothing to add?",22,6768
6768,2,6,Robin ,No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.,23,6769
6769,2,6,Lily ,Thank you.,24,6770
6770,2,6,Robin ,"Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.",25,6771
6771,2,6,Marshall ,I've never need the beer more than I do right now.,26,6772
6772,2,6,Ted ,"I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this.""",27,6773
6773,2,6,Marshall ,"Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.",28,6774
6774,2,6,Barney ,"Really? Laid, you say?",29,6775
6775,2,6,Marshall ,"You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.",30,6776
6776,2,6,Barney ,She hot?,31,6777
6777,2,6,Marshall ,"Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.",32,6778
6778,2,6,Barney ,And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.,33,6779
6779,2,6,Robin ,A what?,34,6780
6780,2,6,Barney ,"A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.",35,6781
6781,2,6,Ted ,What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?,36,6782
6782,2,6,Barney ,"Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.",37,6783
6783,2,6,Marshall ,I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...,38,6784
6784,2,6,Barney ,"Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.",39,6785
6785,2,6,Lily (arriving) ,"So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei...",40,6786
6786,2,6,Marshall ,Classic.,41,6787
6787,2,6,Robin ,"Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?",42,6788
6788,2,6,Ted ,Yeah. Somebody did just quit.,43,6789
6789,2,6,Ted ,"So, where should we eat today? (looking at the assistant with a whole chicken in a container) Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? (the girl leaves, crying)",44,6790
6790,2,6,Marshall ,"Dude, that is cold-blooded.",45,6791
6791,2,6,Ted ,"It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.",46,6792
6792,2,6,Robin ,"Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.",47,6793
6793,2,6,Ted ,It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?,48,6794
6794,2,6,Barney ,"Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",49,6795
6795,2,6,Ted ,"So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?",50,6796
6796,2,6,Lily ,What would I be doing?,51,6797
6797,2,6,Ted ,"Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.",52,6798
6798,2,6,Ted ,You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.,53,6799
6799,2,6,Lily ,"Oh, right, is that the...?",54,6800
6800,2,6,Ted ,Yeah. Here's the model.,55,6801
6801,2,6,Lily ,You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.,56,6802
6802,2,6,Ted ,"I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.",57,6803
6803,2,6,Lily ,How can he not see it? I mean there's the...,58,6804
6804,2,6,Ted ,I know.,59,6805
6805,2,6,Lily ,And the way it...,60,6806
6806,2,6,Ted ,I know.,61,6807
6807,2,6,Lily ,And the two little...,62,6808
6808,2,6,Ted ,I know.,63,6809
6809,2,6,Lily ,It is just...,64,6810
6810,2,6,,"Mr Druthers (arriving): Spectacular? Why, thank you.",65,6811
6811,2,6,Ted ,"Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.",66,6812
6812,2,6,Mr Druthers, Ah.,67,6813
6813,2,6,Lily ,Nice to meet you.,68,6814
6814,2,6,Mr Druthers," Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?",69,6815
6815,2,6,Ted ,"I, uh... I am an architect.",70,6816
6816,2,6,Mr Druthers," Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?",71,6817
6817,2,6,Ted ,"Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.",72,6818
6818,2,6,Mr Druthers," Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?",73,6819
6819,2,6,Ted ,Absolutely.,74,6820
6820,2,6,Mr Druthers, So you're going to design the...,75,6821
6821,2,6,Ted ,Styrofoam trees.,76,6822
6822,2,6,Mr Druthers," Once again, with feeling.",77,6823
6823,2,6,Ted ,Styrofoam trees.,78,6824
6824,2,6,Mr Druthers, Styrofoam trees!,79,6825
6825,2,6,Ted ,Styrofoam trees!,80,6826
6826,2,6,Mr Druthers," That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? (He leaves)",81,6827
6827,2,6,Lily ,"Man, that guy is a total, well... (gestures to the building model)",82,6828
6828,2,6,Marshall ,"Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.",83,6829
6829,2,6,Barney ,"Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",84,6830
6830,2,6,Marshall ,"Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.",85,6831
6831,2,6,Barney ,"Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?",86,6832
6832,2,6,Marshall ,"Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.",87,6833
6833,2,6,,"Barney (stepping into the office, speaking with an Italian accent): Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa...",88,6834
6834,2,6,Pr Lewis, Tell me what you want or get out.,89,6835
6835,2,6,Barney ,Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.,90,6836
6836,2,6,Pr Lewis, Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.,91,6837
6837,2,6,Lily ,I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.,92,6838
6838,2,6,Ted ,"He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop.",93,6839
6839,2,6,Robin ,Did you show lily your design?,94,6840
6840,2,6,Ted ,No.,95,6841
6841,2,6,Lily ,What design?,96,6842
6842,2,6,Ted ,It's nothing.,97,6843
6843,2,6,Robin ,"It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.",98,6844
6844,2,6,Lily ,"Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.",99,6845
6845,2,6,Ted ,"Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough!",100,6846
6846,2,6,Barney ,"Oh, my god. Incredible.",101,6847
6847,2,6,Pr Lewis, Hmm... C minus.,102,6848
6848,2,6,Barney ,C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!,103,6849
6849,2,6,Pr Lewis," You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.",104,6850
6850,2,6,Lily ,Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.,105,6851
6851,2,6,Ted ,"Okay, I'm done.",106,6852
6852,2,6,Lily ,Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.,107,6853
6853,2,6,Ted ,Great. Thanks.,108,6854
6854,2,6,Mr Druthers," Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.",109,6855
6855,2,6,Ted ,"Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.",110,6856
6856,2,6,Mr Druthers, Too green.,111,6857
6857,2,6,Ted ,Too green?,112,6858
6858,2,6,Mr Druthers," Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?",113,6859
6859,2,6,Ted ,I can't un-picture it.,114,6860
6860,2,6,Mr Druthers," Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!",115,6861
6861,2,6,Ted ,What? What's gone?,116,6862
6862,2,6,Mr Druthers, My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,117,6863
6863,2,6,Ted ,"Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.",118,6864
6864,2,6,Mr Druthers," What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.",119,6865
6865,2,6,Ted ,"Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.",120,6866
6866,2,6,Mr Druthers," Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.",121,6867
6867,2,6,Ted ,"Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)",122,6868
6868,2,6,Lily ,Hey.,123,6869
6869,2,6,Ted ,"Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?",124,6870
6870,2,6,Lily ,That's easy. I took it.,125,6871
6871,2,6,Ted ,Why?,126,6872
6872,2,6,Lily ,It's simple.,127,6873
6873,2,6,,[FLASHBACK]Mr Druthers: I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef. I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university,128,6874
6874,2,6,Mr Druthers," Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.",129,6875
6875,2,6,,"Mr Druthers (to a kid): What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!",130,6876
6876,2,6,Lily ,"Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",131,6877
6877,2,6,Ted ,What does his ball have to do with anything?,132,6878
6878,2,6,Lily ,"Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",133,6879
6879,2,6,Robin ,"Hey, guys. What's going on?",134,6880
6880,2,6,Ted ,Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,135,6881
6881,2,6,Robin ,Why? Was he being mean?,136,6882
6882,2,6,Ted ,You know about this?,137,6883
6883,2,6,Robin ,Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?,138,6884
6884,2,6,Lily ,"Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.",139,6885
6885,2,6,Robin ,I gave them to you for your birthday.,140,6886
6886,2,6,Ted ,So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?,141,6887
6887,2,6,Lily ,"I prefer to call them ""justice khakis.""",142,6888
6888,2,6,Ted ,"That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.",143,6889
6889,2,6,Lily ,So is being mean.,144,6890
6890,2,6,Ted ,"Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",145,6891
6891,2,6,Lily ,"Well, that's why I left a note.",146,6892
6892,2,6,Ted ,A note?,147,6893
6893,2,6,Lily ,"Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.",148,6894
6894,2,6,Ted ,"Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.",149,6895
6895,2,6,Lily ,I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.,150,6896
6896,2,6,Marshall ,"I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",151,6897
6897,2,6,Barney ,"I know, I know.",152,6898
6898,2,6,Marshall ,You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.,153,6899
6899,2,6,Barney ,"Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",154,6900
6900,2,6,Marshall ,"Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.",155,6901
6901,2,6,Barney ,"I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.",156,6902
6902,2,6,Barney ,I think I'm falling in love with you.,157,6903
6903,2,6,Pr Lewis," Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.",158,6904
6904,2,6,Barney ,What? No.We had s*x yesterday.,159,6905
6905,2,6,Pr Lewis," Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.",160,6906
6906,2,6,Ted ,"When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",161,6907
6907,2,6,Lily ,No.,162,6908
6908,2,6,Ted ,"What do you mean, no?",163,6909
6909,2,6,Lily ,"I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.",164,6910
6910,2,6,Ted ,"Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.",165,6911
6911,2,6,Mr Druthers, Everybody get in here now!,166,6912
6912,2,6,Lily ,"""Who wants espresso?""",167,6913
6913,2,6,Mr Druthers," Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note.",168,6914
6914,2,6,Lily ,Interesting.,169,6915
6915,2,6,Mr Druthers," Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever ""allegedly"" did!",170,6916
6916,2,6,Lily ,"Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.",171,6917
6917,2,6,Ted ,Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.,172,6918
6918,2,6,Lily ,"No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",173,6919
6919,2,6,Ted ,"This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",174,6920
6920,2,6,Lily ,"All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",175,6921
6921,2,6,Ted ,No. You'll give it back or you're fired.,176,6922
6922,2,6,Lily ,"I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",177,6923
6923,2,6,Ted ,Then you're fired.,178,6924
6924,2,6,Lily ,Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.,179,6925
6925,2,6,Marshall ,"Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",180,6926
6926,2,6,Barney ,Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.,181,6927
6927,2,6,Marshall ,So you're going back over there?,182,6928
6928,2,6,Barney ,"Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",183,6929
6929,2,6,Barney ,I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,184,6930
6930,2,6,Pr Lewis," Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.",185,6931
6931,2,6,Barney ,"But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",186,6932
6932,2,6,Pr Lewis, Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.,187,6933
6933,2,6,Mr Druthers," Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.",188,6934
6934,2,6,Ted ,"Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",189,6935
6935,2,6,Mr Druthers," Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.",190,6936
6936,2,6,Ted ,Lily was mentally deranged.,191,6937
6937,2,6,Mr Druthers, You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.,192,6938
6938,2,6,Ted ,Lily was mentally deranged!,193,6939
6939,2,6,Mr Druthers," Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?",194,6940
6940,2,6,Man ,The clients are here.,195,6941
6941,2,6,Mr Druthers, Excellent. Bring them in.,196,6942
6942,2,6,,Ted from 2030: Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.,197,6943
6943,2,6,Mr Druthers," Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.",198,6944
6944,2,6,Client ,That's a pen1s!,199,6945
6945,2,6,Mr Druthers, That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.,200,6946
6946,2,6,Client ,We're not building a pen1s. You got any other ideas?,201,6947
6947,2,6,Mr Druthers, Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.,202,6948
6948,2,6,Client ,"Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here.",203,6949
6949,2,6,,Ted from 2030: The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.,204,6950
6950,2,6,Ted ,Wait! We have one more idea for you.,205,6951
6951,2,6,Mr Druthers," Ted, what are you doing?",206,6952
6952,2,6,Ted ,I have another design.,207,6953
6953,2,6,Mr Druthers," Sit down, shut up right now.",208,6954
6954,2,6,Ted ,No.,209,6955
6955,2,6,Robin ,To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!,210,6956
6956,2,6,All ,Probably!,211,6957
6957,2,6,Lily ,"Congrats, ted.",212,6958
6958,2,6,Ted ,"Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.",213,6959
6959,2,6,Lily ,"Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.",214,6960
6960,2,6,Ted ,"Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...",215,6961
6961,2,6,Lily ,"No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.",216,6962
6962,2,6,Lily ,"Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.",217,6963
6963,2,6,Robin ,"Barney! Oh, my god!",218,6964
6964,2,6,Ted ,What happened?,219,6965
6965,2,6,Pr Lewis, He broke his hip.,220,6966
6966,2,6,Barney ,"That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.",221,6967
6967,2,6,Pr Lewis," No, he's not fine.",222,6968
6968,2,6,Marshall ,"Professor Lewis, hi.",223,6969
6969,2,6,Pr Lewis, Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.,224,6970
6970,2,6,Barney ,"Yeah, she was.",225,6971
6971,2,6,Pr Lewis, B plus.,226,6972
6972,2,6,Barney ,"B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""!",227,6973
6973,2,6,Marshall ,Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.,228,6974
6974,2,6,Barney ,It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!,229,6975
6975,2,7,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when you reach your late twenty, you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out. Like with aunt Lily. Even though she was back from San Francisco, she was still on a quest to find herself.",1,6976
6976,2,7,Lily ,It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.,2,6977
6977,2,7,,Ted from 2030: And she did find it.,3,6978

6984,2,7,Ted ,"Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?",10,6985
6985,2,7,Robin ,No.,11,6986

6987,2,7,Lily ,"Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.",13,6988
6988,2,7,Robin ,I'm sorry.,14,6989
6989,2,7,Barney ,"Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. (Marshall takes a photo of her).",15,6990
6990,2,7,Lily ,What do you want?,16,6991
6991,2,7,Ted ,I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.,17,6992

7000,2,7,Marshall ,I've never need the beer more than I do right now.,26,7001

7002,2,7,Marshall ,"Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.",28,7003
7003,2,7,Barney ,"Really? Laid, you say?",29,7004
7004,2,7,Marshall ,"You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.",30,7005
7005,2,7,Barney ,She hot?,31,7006
7006,2,7,Marshall ,"Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.",32,7007
7007,2,7,Barney ,And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.,33,7008
7008,2,7,Robin ,A what?,34,7009
7009,2,7,Barney ,"A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.",35,7010

7019,2,7,Marshall ,"Dude, that is cold-blooded.",45,7020
7020,2,7,Ted ,"It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.",46,7021
7021,2,7,Robin ,"Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.",47,7022
7022,2,7,Ted ,It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?,48,7023
7023,2,7,Barney ,"Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",49,7024
7024,2,7,Ted ,"So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?",50,7025
7025,2,7,Lily ,What would I be doing?,51,7026
7026,2,7,Ted ,"Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.",52,7027
7027,2,7,Ted ,You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.,53,7028

7029,2,7,Ted ,Yeah. Here's the model.,55,7030
7030,2,7,Lily ,You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.,56,7031

7042,2,7,Lily ,Nice to meet you.,68,7043
7043,2,7,Mr Druthers," Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?",69,7044
7044,2,7,Ted ,"I, uh... I am an architect.",70,7045
7045,2,7,Mr Druthers," Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?",71,7046
7046,2,7,Ted ,"Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.",72,7047
7047,2,7,Mr Druthers," Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?",73,7048
7048,2,7,Ted ,Absolutely.,74,7049

7055,2,7,Mr Druthers," That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? (He leaves)",81,7056

7058,2,7,Barney ,"Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",84,7059
7059,2,7,Marshall ,"Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.",85,7060
7060,2,7,Barney ,"Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?",86,7061
7061,2,7,Marshall ,"Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.",87,7062
7062,2,7,,"Barney (stepping into the office, speaking with an Italian accent): Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa...",88,7063
7063,2,7,Pr Lewis, Tell me what you want or get out.,89,7064
7064,2,7,Barney ,Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.,90,7065
7065,2,7,Pr Lewis, Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.,91,7066
7066,2,7,Lily ,I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.,92,7067
7067,2,7,Ted ,"He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop.",93,7068
7068,2,7,Robin ,Did you show lily your design?,94,7069
7069,2,7,Ted ,No.,95,7070
7070,2,7,Lily ,What design?,96,7071
7071,2,7,Ted ,It's nothing.,97,7072
7072,2,7,Robin ,"It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.",98,7073
7073,2,7,Lily ,"Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.",99,7074
7074,2,7,Ted ,"Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough!",100,7075
7075,2,7,Barney ,"Oh, my god. Incredible.",101,7076
7076,2,7,Pr Lewis, Hmm... C minus.,102,7077
7077,2,7,Barney ,C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!,103,7078
7078,2,7,Pr Lewis," You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.",104,7079
7079,2,7,Lily ,Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.,105,7080
7080,2,7,Ted ,"Okay, I'm done.",106,7081
7081,2,7,Lily ,Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.,107,7082
7082,2,7,Ted ,Great. Thanks.,108,7083
7083,2,7,Mr Druthers," Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.",109,7084
7084,2,7,Ted ,"Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.",110,7085
7085,2,7,Mr Druthers, Too green.,111,7086
7086,2,7,Ted ,Too green?,112,7087
7087,2,7,Mr Druthers," Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?",113,7088
7088,2,7,Ted ,I can't un-picture it.,114,7089
7089,2,7,Mr Druthers," Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!",115,7090
7090,2,7,Ted ,What? What's gone?,116,7091
7091,2,7,Mr Druthers, My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,117,7092
7092,2,7,Ted ,"Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.",118,7093
7093,2,7,Mr Druthers," What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.",119,7094
7094,2,7,Ted ,"Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.",120,7095
7095,2,7,Mr Druthers," Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.",121,7096
7096,2,7,Ted ,"Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)",122,7097
7097,2,7,Lily ,Hey.,123,7098
7098,2,7,Ted ,"Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?",124,7099
7099,2,7,Lily ,That's easy. I took it.,125,7100
7100,2,7,Ted ,Why?,126,7101
7101,2,7,Lily ,It's simple.,127,7102
7102,2,7,,[FLASHBACK]Mr Druthers: I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef. I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university,128,7103
7103,2,7,Mr Druthers," Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.",129,7104
7104,2,7,,"Mr Druthers (to a kid): What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!",130,7105
7105,2,7,Lily ,"Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",131,7106
7106,2,7,Ted ,What does his ball have to do with anything?,132,7107
7107,2,7,Lily ,"Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",133,7108
7108,2,7,Robin ,"Hey, guys. What's going on?",134,7109
7109,2,7,Ted ,Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,135,7110
7110,2,7,Robin ,Why? Was he being mean?,136,7111
7111,2,7,Ted ,You know about this?,137,7112
7112,2,7,Robin ,Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?,138,7113
7113,2,7,Lily ,"Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.",139,7114
7114,2,7,Robin ,I gave them to you for your birthday.,140,7115
7115,2,7,Ted ,So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?,141,7116
7116,2,7,Lily ,"I prefer to call them ""justice khakis.""",142,7117
7117,2,7,Ted ,"That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.",143,7118
7118,2,7,Lily ,So is being mean.,144,7119
7119,2,7,Ted ,"Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",145,7120
7120,2,7,Lily ,"Well, that's why I left a note.",146,7121
7121,2,7,Ted ,A note?,147,7122
7122,2,7,Lily ,"Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.",148,7123
7123,2,7,Ted ,"Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.",149,7124
7124,2,7,Lily ,I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.,150,7125
7125,2,7,Marshall ,"I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",151,7126
7126,2,7,Barney ,"I know, I know.",152,7127
7127,2,7,Marshall ,You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.,153,7128
7128,2,7,Barney ,"Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",154,7129
7129,2,7,Marshall ,"Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.",155,7130
7130,2,7,Barney ,"I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.",156,7131
7131,2,7,Barney ,I think I'm falling in love with you.,157,7132
7132,2,7,Pr Lewis," Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.",158,7133
7133,2,7,Barney ,What? No.We had s*x yesterday.,159,7134
7134,2,7,Pr Lewis," Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.",160,7135
7135,2,7,Ted ,"When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",161,7136
7136,2,7,Lily ,No.,162,7137
7137,2,7,Ted ,"What do you mean, no?",163,7138
7138,2,7,Lily ,"I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.",164,7139
7139,2,7,Ted ,"Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.",165,7140
7140,2,7,Mr Druthers, Everybody get in here now!,166,7141
7141,2,7,Lily ,"""Who wants espresso?""",167,7142
7142,2,7,Mr Druthers," Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note.",168,7143
7143,2,7,Lily ,Interesting.,169,7144
7144,2,7,Mr Druthers," Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever ""allegedly"" did!",170,7145
7145,2,7,Lily ,"Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.",171,7146
7146,2,7,Ted ,Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.,172,7147
7147,2,7,Lily ,"No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",173,7148
7148,2,7,Ted ,"This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",174,7149
7149,2,7,Lily ,"All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",175,7150
7150,2,7,Ted ,No. You'll give it back or you're fired.,176,7151
7151,2,7,Lily ,"I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",177,7152
7152,2,7,Ted ,Then you're fired.,178,7153
7153,2,7,Lily ,Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.,179,7154
7154,2,7,Marshall ,"Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",180,7155
7155,2,7,Barney ,Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.,181,7156
7156,2,7,Marshall ,So you're going back over there?,182,7157
7157,2,7,Barney ,"Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",183,7158
7158,2,7,Barney ,I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,184,7159
7159,2,7,Pr Lewis," Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.",185,7160
7160,2,7,Barney ,"But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",186,7161
7161,2,7,Pr Lewis, Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.,187,7162
7162,2,7,Mr Druthers," Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.",188,7163
7163,2,7,Ted ,"Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",189,7164
7164,2,7,Mr Druthers," Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.",190,7165
7165,2,7,Ted ,Lily was mentally deranged.,191,7166
7166,2,7,Mr Druthers, You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.,192,7167
7167,2,7,Ted ,Lily was mentally deranged!,193,7168
7168,2,7,Mr Druthers," Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?",194,7169
7169,2,7,Man ,The clients are here.,195,7170
7170,2,7,Mr Druthers, Excellent. Bring them in.,196,7171
7171,2,7,,Ted from 2030: Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.,197,7172
7172,2,7,Mr Druthers," Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.",198,7173
7173,2,7,Client ,That's a pen1s!,199,7174
7174,2,7,Mr Druthers, That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.,200,7175
7175,2,7,Client ,We're not building a pen1s. You got any other ideas?,201,7176
7176,2,7,Mr Druthers, Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.,202,7177
7177,2,7,Client ,"Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here.",203,7178
7178,2,7,,Ted from 2030: The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.,204,7179
7179,2,7,Ted ,Wait! We have one more idea for you.,205,7180
7180,2,7,Mr Druthers," Ted, what are you doing?",206,7181
7181,2,7,Ted ,I have another design.,207,7182
7182,2,7,Mr Druthers," Sit down, shut up right now.",208,7183
7183,2,7,Ted ,No.,209,7184
7184,2,7,Robin ,To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!,210,7185
7185,2,7,All ,Probably!,211,7186
7186,2,7,Lily ,"Congrats, ted.",212,7187
7187,2,7,Ted ,"Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.",213,7188
7188,2,7,Lily ,"Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.",214,7189
7189,2,7,Ted ,"Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...",215,7190
7190,2,7,Lily ,"No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.",216,7191
7191,2,7,Lily ,"Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.",217,7192
7192,2,7,Robin ,"Barney! Oh, my god!",218,7193
7193,2,7,Ted ,What happened?,219,7194
7194,2,7,Pr Lewis, He broke his hip.,220,7195
7195,2,7,Barney ,"That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.",221,7196
7196,2,7,Pr Lewis," No, he's not fine.",222,7197
7197,2,7,Marshall ,"Professor Lewis, hi.",223,7198
7198,2,7,Pr Lewis, Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.,224,7199
7199,2,7,Barney ,"Yeah, she was.",225,7200
7200,2,7,Pr Lewis, B plus.,226,7201
7201,2,7,Barney ,"B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""!",227,7202
7202,2,7,Marshall ,Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.,228,7203
7203,2,7,Barney ,It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!,229,7204
7204,2,8,,"Ted from 2030: And so, after six months apart, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall were finally back together.",1,7205

7206,2,8,Marshall ,"Yes! Thank you. Uhm, I learned how to cook while you were gone this summer.",3,7207
7207,2,8,Lily ,Oh. Do you want to cook dinner tonight?,4,7208
7208,2,8,Marshall ,"Yeah, sure. How about pancakes?",5,7209
7209,2,8,,Ted from 2030: And things were back to normal... Almost.,6,7210
7210,2,8,Lily ,"You may not have much range, but at least I'm marrying a guy who knows how to make pancakes.",7,7211
7211,2,8,Marshall ,"Oh, uhm...",8,7212
7212,2,8,Lily ,"I mean, uhm... Well, I... I realize that we haven't really discussed whether us getting back together means us getting married, but... I still wanna. Do you still wanna?",9,7213
7213,2,8,Marshall ,Really?,10,7214
7214,2,8,Lily ,"Of course, I love you.",11,7215
7215,2,8,Marshall ,"No, I mean, that's how you're gonna do it? ""Do you still wanna?"" That's like the lamest proposal ever. When I did it, I got down on my knees... I don't know, I'm just saying.",12,7216
7216,2,8,Lily (getting down on one knee) ,"Marshall Eriksen, will you ma...",13,7217
7217,2,8,Marshall ,"No, no, no, no, no, no.",14,7218
7218,2,8,Lily ,What?!,15,7219
7219,2,8,Marshall ,"You can't lead with that. You got to... build up to that. You got to have, like, a little speech.",16,7220
7220,2,8,Lily ,Do you remember your proposal to me? (She puts her hand on her eye),17,7221
7221,2,8,Marshall ,I had a speech prepared.,18,7222
7222,2,8,Lily ,What do you want to hear?,19,7223
7223,2,8,Marshall ,"I don't know. I mean, you could tell me, like, about how good-looking and funny and smart I am and I've been working out lately. It might be nice for you to mention something about that.",20,7224
7224,2,8,Lily ,Marshall... You are good-looking...,21,7225
7225,2,8,Marshall ,Thank you.,22,7226
7226,2,8,Lily ,Funny...,23,7227
7227,2,8,Marshall ,"Oh, thanks.",24,7228
7228,2,8,Lily ,Smart...,25,7229
7229,2,8,Marshall ,And a few tears wouldn't hurt.,26,7230
7230,2,8,Lily ,"Okay, would you freakin' marry me already?",27,7231
7231,2,8,Marshall ,"I'll marry you. Of course. But, uhm, until you see a ring on this finger, don't expect me to put out.",28,7232
7232,2,8,Lily ,"Yeah, right. (They kiss)",29,7233
7233,2,8,Marshall ,I'll give you this. That was a very creative use of syrup.,30,7234
7234,2,8,Lily ,"I can't even look Mrs. Butterworth in the eye. Oh, my God. We're getting married!",31,7235
7235,2,8,Marshall ,"I know, I know.",32,7236
7236,2,8,,"Ted from 2030: It was a moment of happiness, followed of course by a moment of total panic. See, when they called off their first wedding, Aunt Lily took off for San Francisco leaving Uncle Marshall with the unfortunate task of telling his entire family.",33,7237
7237,2,8,,"[FLASHBACK]Marshall (on the phone): Yeah, so now she's gone and the wedding's off. What do you call someone who just takes off and leaves like that? What do you call that? I think that that's a little strong. I can't even believe you would use a word like that. Geez, Grandma.",34,7238
7238,2,8,Lily ,"Man, I made a big mess by canceling this wedding, didn't I?",35,7239
7239,2,8,Marshall ,"It's okay, baby. You're not just realizing that now, are you?",36,7240
7240,2,8,Lily ,"God, the idea of standing up there in front of all those people who hate my guts... Just makes me want to run off to Atlantic City and get married today.",37,7241
7241,2,8,Marshall ,Yeah...,38,7242
7242,2,8,Robin ,Coming up at 11:00: Are there piranhas in the East River? What you don't know... could eat you.,39,7243

7253,2,8,Lily ,I hope not because I plan on getting hammered.,50,7254
7254,2,8,Ted ,"Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work. I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager.",51,7255
7255,2,8,Lily ,"Ted, for the rest of our lives, we are going to be telling the amazing story of how we went to Atlantic City and got married. Don't you want to be in that story?",52,7256
7256,2,8,Ted ,Of course I do. Let's go to Atlantic City!,53,7257
7257,2,8,Marshall ,Yeah!,54,7258
7258,2,8,Ted ,"Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate?",55,7259
7259,2,8,Marshall ,You got it.,56,7260
7260,2,8,Barney ,"Hey, guys.",57,7261
7261,2,8,Ted ,Wow. A pedicure.,58,7262
7262,2,8,Barney ,"Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine.",59,7263
7263,2,8,Lily ,We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!,60,7264
7264,2,8,Barney ,"Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?",61,7265
7265,2,8,Marshall ,So are you in or not?,62,7266
7266,2,8,Barney ,"Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done.",63,7267
7267,2,8,Marshall ,"No, we got to get going to the...",64,7268
7268,2,8,Lily ,"Well, actually, I mean... It is my wedding day, and since we're here...",65,7269
7269,2,8,,Ted from 2030: So we all got a pedicure and then headed down... to Atlantic City.,66,7270
7270,2,8,Lily ,Wow. Look at this place. I guess I'll have my pick of something old.,67,7271
7271,2,8,Marshall ,And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.,68,7272
7272,2,8,Barney ,"Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend.",69,7273
7273,2,8,Ted ,You been here before?,70,7274
7274,2,8,Barney ,"Oh, uh, once or twice.",71,7275
7275,2,8,Chinese 1, Barney!,72,7276
7276,2,8,Barney ,"Ah, good to see you, too. Three times, maybe.",73,7277
7277,2,8,Lily ,The wedding chapel... This is it. Are you ready to do this?,74,7278
7278,2,8,Marshall ,I'm ready. Let's get married.,75,7279
7279,2,8,,"Barney, Ted and Robin: Yeah.",76,7280
7280,2,8,Lily ,"Oh, crap. I don't have a veil. I'm a bride, I can't get married without a veil. And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet. Oh, my God, we're getting married.",77,7281
7281,2,8,Robin ,"Don't worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey.",78,7282
7282,2,8,Lily ,"Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit.",79,7283
7283,2,8,Robin ,"Oh, really? Thanks.",80,7284
7284,2,8,Lily ,"Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride, you can't look better than me.",81,7285
7285,2,8,Robin ,Done. (She leaves),82,7286
7286,2,8,Lily ,I'm going to get the bouquet. You guys get the veil. We'll meet in the chapel in 20 minutes. Ready? Break. (She leaves),83,7287
7287,2,8,Ted ,You guys want to go gamble?,84,7288
7288,2,8,Marshall ,"No, we got to go get the veil.",85,7289
7289,2,8,Ted ,"Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one.",86,7290
7290,2,8,Marshall ,"Yeah, okay.",87,7291
7291,2,8,Barney ,"No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil. (He leaves)",88,7292
7292,2,8,Ted ,"So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life. I'm proud of you, buddy.",89,7293
7293,2,8,Marshall ,Thanks.,90,7294
7294,2,8,Ted ,How are you feeling?,91,7295
7295,2,8,Marshall ,"Great, a little nervous.",92,7296
7296,2,8,Ted ,Yeah? Craps?,93,7297
7297,2,8,Marshall ,Not that nervous.,94,7298
7298,2,8,Ted ,"No, I mean do you want to play craps.",95,7299
7299,2,8,Marshall ,"Oh, yeah, definitely.",96,7300
7300,2,8,Barney ,"Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?",97,7301
7301,2,8,Ted ,What did you just say?,98,7302
7302,2,8,Marshall ,"Barney, no.",99,7303
7303,2,8,Barney ,"Marshall, I'm your best man.",100,7304
7304,2,8,Marshall ,You're not my best man.,101,7305
7305,2,8,Ted ,Right here.,102,7306
7306,2,8,Barney ,"And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend.",103,7307
7307,2,8,Marshall ,You're not my best friend.,104,7308
7308,2,8,Ted ,Right here.,105,7309
7309,2,8,Marshall ,"Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party. I've got, like, 18 minutes.",106,7310
7310,2,8,Ted ,18 minutes...,107,7311
7311,2,8,Lily ,"Oh, good. Did you get the veil?",108,7312
7312,2,8,Barney ,Of course.,109,7313
7313,2,8,Marshall ,And it took us exactly 18 minutes. We went to a strip club.,110,7314
7314,2,8,Ted ,Dude!,111,7315
7315,2,8,Barney ,Unbelievable!,112,7316
7316,2,8,Marshall ,We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance.,113,7317
7317,2,8,Lily ,Your last lap dance ever.,114,7318
7318,2,8,Marshall ,Right. What?,115,7319
7319,2,8,,"Robin (arriving, wearing a ""shirt boobs""): Okay, I'm here. Right?",116,7320
7320,2,8,Ted ,"Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City.",117,7321
7321,2,8,Robin ,Does it smell like strippers in here?,118,7322
7322,2,8,Ted ,"That's weird, right? Marshall and Lily are getting married!",119,7323
7323,2,8,Lily ,"Hell, yeah, look at this. (She turns on her musical bouquet, playing the Wedding March)",120,7324
7324,2,8,Marshall ,"Oh, baby, this is it. Let's do this thing.",121,7325
7325,2,8,Lily ,Hi. We're here to get married.,122,7326
7326,2,8,Woman ,Congratulations. We offer a variety of packages to give you the special day you've always dreamed about.,123,7327
7327,2,8,Marshall ,We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine.,124,7328
7328,2,8,Woman ,"Yeah. You know this isn't Vegas, right?",125,7329
7329,2,8,Robin ,"Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen. Here, it looks like everyone brought their own.",126,7330
7330,2,8,,Ted (looking at Robin's shirt): What?,127,7331
7331,2,8,Woman ,It also takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey. The earliest I could book you for is Monday.,128,7332
7332,2,8,Lily ,"No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point.",129,7333
7333,2,8,Woman ,"Look, I don't know what to say, but if you guys don't want to book a wedding for Monday or play a round of keno, I can't help you. Thirty-five.",130,7334
7334,2,8,Ted ,"Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time.",131,7335
7335,2,8,Woman ,"Yes, they do, but they don't elope. They choose Atlantic City for its white sand beaches, world-class amenities, and exotic Riviera feel.",132,7336
7336,2,8,Lily ,Have you been outside?,133,7337
7337,2,8,Ted ,There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana.,134,7338
7338,2,8,Marshall ,"You guys, take it easy, guys. Are you sure about this?",135,7339
7339,2,8,Woman ,"About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.",136,7340
7340,2,8,Barney ,Bright side: the bachelor party continues!,137,7341
7341,2,8,Ted ,"Yes! Continues? You mean ""start."" He means ""start."" We went to a strip club.",138,7342
7342,2,8,Woman ,Twenty-seven.,139,7343
7343,2,8,Lily ,Is there any way that we could get a license today?,140,7344
7344,2,8,Woman ,"You could go to the courthouse. In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be waived, but you have to have a good reason.",141,7345
7345,2,8,Lily ,"Well, we're in love.",142,7346
7346,2,8,Marshall ,What better reason could there be?,143,7347
7347,2,8,Woman ,"The last one I heard was, ""I'm going to Iraq tomorrow to defend my country,"" but, you know, give yours a whirl.",144,7348
7348,2,8,,Ted from 2030: So we went to the courthouse.,145,7349
7349,2,8,Marshall ,"God, this is taking forever.",146,7350
7350,2,8,Robin (to Ted) ,Can't believe they're getting married.,147,7351
7351,2,8,Ted ,"I know. I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through. In fact, that crazy road has led them all the way here to Atlantic City...",148,7352
7352,2,8,Robin ,"Ted, up here.",149,7353
7353,2,8,Ted ,Uhm?,150,7354
7354,2,8,Robin ,You were just staring at my shirt boobs.,151,7355
7355,2,8,Ted ,"No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt.",152,7356
7356,2,8,Chinese 2," Hey, it's Barney! Barney!",153,7357
7357,2,8,Barney ,Hi.,154,7358
7358,2,8,Chinese 2, (speaks Chinese language)...suit up! (both speak Chinese language) Legen-...-dary!,155,7359
7359,2,8,Barney ,See you.,156,7360
7360,2,8,Ted ,What the hell was that?,157,7361
7361,2,8,Barney ,A... Chinese guy?,158,7362
7362,2,8,Marshall ,"Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license, but we need to skip the waiting period because... We're in love.",159,7363
7363,2,8,Woman 2, Aw. I'm gonna waive this waiting period right now.,160,7364
7364,2,8,Lily ,"Oh, really?!",161,7365
7365,2,8,Woman 2," Is what I would say if I could waive the waiting period, but unfortunately, only a judge can do that.",162,7366
7366,2,8,Lily ,"Oh. Well, so can we see a judge?",163,7367
7367,2,8,Woman 2, Absolutely.,164,7368
7368,2,8,Lily ,Really?!,165,7369
7369,2,8,Woman 2," Is what I would say if there was any chance of you seeing a judge today, which there isn't.",166,7370
7370,2,8,Marshall ,Why are you doing this to us?!,167,7371
7371,2,8,Woman 2, 'Cause you're on Candid Camera!,168,7372
7372,2,8,Robin ,Really?!,169,7373
7373,2,8,Woman 2, Is what I would say...,170,7374
7374,2,8,Marshall ,You know what? We get it.,171,7375
7375,2,8,Lily ,"Okay, this is a good plan B. Judges are people. People go to the bathroom. A judge is bound to come by eventually, and we'll get married. I'm sure we won't be waiting long.",172,7376
7376,2,8,Marshall ,"Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds.",173,7377
7377,2,8,Barney ,Vultures.,174,7378
7378,2,8,Ted (to Robin) ,Psst. (They move away),175,7379
7379,2,8,Robin ,What? Here?,176,7380
7380,2,8,Ted ,Yeah. Got a little time to k*ll.,177,7381
7381,2,8,Robin ,"Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it?",178,7382
7382,2,8,Ted ,No. A little.,179,7383
7383,2,8,Robin ,Something is seriously wrong with you.,180,7384
7384,2,8,Ted ,"So what, is that a no?",181,7385
7385,2,8,Robin ,"All right, let's do it.",182,7386
7386,2,8,Ted ,"All right. Um, also...?",183,7387
7387,2,8,Robin ,"Yes, I'll leave it on.",184,7388
7388,2,8,Ted ,Sweet.,185,7389
7389,2,8,Barney ,"Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen.",186,7390
7390,2,8,Lily ,"Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative.",187,7391
7391,2,8,Barney ,"You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that bullet.",188,7392
7392,2,8,Lily ,"Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on!",189,7393
7393,2,8,Judge ,Turn it off.,190,7394
7394,2,8,Lily ,Okay. May we please get married today?,191,7395
7395,2,8,Judge ,"Now, normally I would say no to a request like that, but you two impress me. Just the fact that you've been together for ten years, standing by each other's side through thick and thin, never wavering. What was that?",192,7396
7396,2,8,Lily ,What was what?,193,7397
7397,2,8,Judge ,That little look. What was that?,194,7398
7398,2,8,Marshall ,A look of love.,195,7399
7399,2,8,Judge ,"You two have stood together through thick and thin, right?",196,7400
7400,2,8,Marshall ,"You know, what's thick? what's thin?",197,7401
7401,2,8,Lily ,"Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.",198,7402
7402,2,8,Marshall ,I have.,199,7403
7403,2,8,Judge ,"All right, what was that look? What's going on?",200,7404
7404,2,8,Barney ,They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had s*x in the closet. What? We're under oath.,201,7405
7405,2,8,Ted ,"No, we're not.",202,7406
7406,2,8,Barney ,"Yeah, we are. He's a judge.",203,7407
7407,2,8,Ted ,Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?,204,7408
7408,2,8,Barney ,"Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it.",205,7409
7409,2,8,Marshall ,Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen.,206,7410
7410,2,8,Lily ,"No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today.",207,7411
7411,2,8,Marshall ,"Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license.",208,7412
7412,2,8,Lily ,Except international waters. So let's find a ship captain. A ship captain can marry us. There's boats all over this place.,209,7413
7413,2,8,Ted ,"Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage?",210,7414
7414,2,8,Lily ,This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go. (To a woman) Excuse me. Are you a ship captain?,211,7415
7415,2,8,Woman ,This is my machine.,212,7416
7416,2,8,Marshall ,I should go talk to her.,213,7417
7417,2,8,Robin ,"No, let me.",214,7418
7418,2,8,Ted ,Blackjack?,215,7419
7419,2,8,Marshall ,Yeah.,216,7420
7420,2,8,Lily ,"Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip, so we're getting closer.",217,7421
7421,2,8,Robin ,"Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today?",218,7422
7422,2,8,Lily ,"Because... If we don't do it today, I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people looking all disapproving and judging me while sipping little cups of mayonnaise and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long.",219,7423
7423,2,8,Robin ,Nobody's gonna do that.,220,7424
7424,2,8,Lily ,"No, they're not because I'm not gonna give them the chance. I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight.",221,7425
7425,2,8,Robin ,"Sweetie, this is crazy. You're never gonna find a ship capt...",222,7426
7426,2,8,Marshall ,"Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain.",223,7427
7427,2,8,Lily ,What?,224,7428
7428,2,8,Ted ,Yeah. First guy we talked to. Ship captain. How great is that?,225,7429
7429,2,8,Lily ,"See? See, this is destiny. So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us?",226,7430
7430,2,8,Captain ,"I sure can. If there's two things I love, it's bringing people together in marriage and making $5,000.",227,7431
7431,2,8,Marshall ,What?,228,7432
7432,2,8,Lily ,"Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it.",229,7433
7433,2,8,Barney ,I can get us that money.,230,7434
7434,2,8,Ted ,How?,231,7435
7435,2,8,Barney ,Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?,232,7436
7436,2,8,Ted ,Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?,233,7437
7437,2,8,Barney ,"Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called ""Shing Hasabu Shing"". Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money.",234,7438
7438,2,8,Robin ,"No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away.",235,7439
7439,2,8,Barney ,"Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it.",236,7440
7440,2,8,,"Ted from 2030: Now, I had been to a lot of casinos before that night, and I've been to a lot of casinos since, but in all that time I've never seen a game quite like this one. To this day, I have no idea how it was played. But luckily, Barney did.",237,7441
7441,2,8,Lily ,Do you understand what's happening?,238,7442
7442,2,8,Ted ,Not a clue.,239,7443
7443,2,8,Robin ,Do you think he's winning?,240,7444
7444,2,8,Ted ,I don't even know if he's playing.,241,7445
7445,2,8,Marshall ,"Wait, I get it. I understand this game.",242,7446
7446,2,8,Ted ,"No, you don't.",243,7447
7447,2,8,Marshall ,"I totally understand the game, Theodore. Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean.",244,7448
7448,2,8,Barney ,"Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm... My God, you're right.",245,7449
7449,2,8,Lily ,Wow. It's beautiful.,246,7450
7450,2,8,Marshall ,"Thanks, Barney.",247,7451
7451,2,8,Barney ,"Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling!",248,7452
7452,2,8,Ted ,"When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?",249,7453
7453,2,8,Barney ,Why can't I do it just a little?,250,7454
7454,2,8,Lily ,Okay. Let's get this started.,251,7455
7455,2,8,Captain ,"Okay, uh... You guys want the serious one or the funny one?",252,7456
7456,2,8,Captain ,"You sure? I got a lot of great nautical jokes in there. Like how you two float each other's boat, stuff like that.",253,7457
7457,2,8,Marshall ,"Yeah, serious is probably good.",254,7458
7458,2,8,Captain ,"""We stand witness today to celebrate the union of Lily and Marshall. Today, you two will become one, sharing your lives, the happiness, the sadness, the frustrations and the joy...""",255,7459
7459,2,8,Ted ,This is pretty cool. I can't believe you never want to get married.,256,7460
7460,2,8,Robin ,"I never said ""never.""",257,7461
7461,2,8,Captain ,"""...to declare your love and devotion to each other in front of friends and family, all the people who matter most to you."" What was that?",258,7462
7462,2,8,Marshall ,What was what?,259,7463
7463,2,8,Captain ,That little look. You two just shared a look.,260,7464
7464,2,8,Lily ,We don't want to do this.,261,7465
7465,2,8,Marshall ,We don't.,262,7466
7466,2,8,Ted ,Are you kidding me? You guys are calling off another wedding?,263,7467
7467,2,8,Robin ,After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?,264,7468
7468,2,8,Barney ,"Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?",265,7469
7469,2,8,Ted ,You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?,266,7470
7470,2,8,Lily ,"Yes. Because it's gonna be amazing. Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family and I didn't want to do all that work, but... Now that we're here... I realize that I have to face Marshall's family and I really want to do all that work.",267,7471
7471,2,8,Marshall ,"So do I. And yeah... My family might still be upset with you. But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other and none of that other stuff is gonna matter.",268,7472
7472,2,8,Lily ,"I love you, Marshmallow.",269,7473
7473,2,8,Marshall ,"I love you, too, Lilypad.",270,7474
7474,2,8,Captain ,I now pronounce you man and wife.,271,7475
7475,2,8,Lily ,What?!,272,7476
7476,2,8,Captain ,Is that not right?,273,7477
7477,2,8,Marshall ,Are... we married? Did you just marry us? Weren't you listening? We don't want to be married.,274,7478
7478,2,8,Captain ,Uh... I-I suppose I could unpronounce you.,275,7479
7479,2,8,,Both Marshall and Lily: Unpronounce us! Unpronounce us!,276,7480
7480,2,8,Captain ,"All right, I unpronounce you man and wife.",277,7481
7481,2,8,Lily ,"Oh, whew... That was close.",278,7482
7482,2,8,,Ted from 2030: And that's the story of how Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily got married for 12 seconds somewhere off the coast of Atlantic City.,279,7483
7483,2,8,,"Ted (wearing Robin's shirt boobs): Hey, guys.",280,7484
7484,2,8,Marshall ,Hey... Ted.,281,7485
7485,2,8,Lily ,Is Robin here?,282,7486
7486,2,8,Marshall ,"Man, I hope so.",283,7487
7487,2,9,Future Ted VO,...learn about relationships is that you're never done getting to know someone.,1,7488
7488,2,9,Ted ,You know how to make crepes? That is so cool.,2,7489
7489,2,9,Future Ted VO, Some aren't as nice.,3,7490
7490,2,9,Robin ,"And then there was Derek and counting you, that puts the total up to...",4,7491
7491,2,9,Ted ,"Oh, I got your total...counting along...",5,7492
7492,2,9,Future Ted VO, And some are just weird.,6,7493
7493,2,9,Ted ,You're scared of the Seven Dwarfs?,7,7494
7494,2,9,Robin ,"Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?",8,7495
7495,2,9,Barney ,"Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either.",9,7496
7496,2,9,Robin ,Why?,10,7497
7497,2,9,Barney ,"Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?",11,7498
7498,2,9,Robin ,"No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.",12,7499
7499,2,9,Barney ,"Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.",13,7500
7500,2,9,Barney ,"Come on, let's go.",14,7501
7501,2,9,Robin ,"All right, I'm in.",15,7502
7502,2,9,Barney ,To the Willowbrook Mall!,16,7503
7503,2,9,,"Ted, Marshall: To the Willowbrook Mall!",17,7504
7504,2,9,Robin ,"Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going.",18,7505
7505,2,9,Ted ,What? Why not?,19,7506
7506,2,9,Robin ,I just don't feel like going to a mall.,20,7507
7507,2,9,Lily ,We can split a cinnabun.,21,7508
7508,2,9,Robin ,"No, I'm really not gonna go.",22,7509
7509,2,9,Ted ,"Come on, it'll be fun.",23,7510
7510,2,9,Robin ,"No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls.",24,7511
7511,2,9,Barney ,Why not?,25,7512
7512,2,9,Robin ,I'd rather not say.,26,7513
7513,2,9,Ted ,"Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls. If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to. I think we should all just respect her privacy.",27,7514
7514,2,9,Robin ,Thanks Ted.,28,7515
7515,2,9,Ted ,"So, what's the deal with you and malls?",29,7516
7516,2,9,Robin ,"You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to.",30,7517
7517,2,9,Ted ,"Yeah, with those people. I'm your boyfriend. Come on, what is it? Did you get arrested in a mall?",31,7518
7518,2,9,Robin ,No.,32,7519
7519,2,9,Ted ,Dumped in a mall?,33,7520
7520,2,9,Robin ,Ted.,34,7521
7521,2,9,Ted ,Found out you were Canadian at a mall?,35,7522
7522,2,9,Robin ,Let it go.,36,7523
7523,2,9,Ted ,Trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Robin: Let it go.,37,7524
7524,2,9,Ted ,Mauled at the mall?,38,7525
7525,2,9,Robin ,"Let it go. And who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Ted: Not me in Ohio when I was nine, that's for sure.",39,7526
7526,2,9,Ted ,"What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?",40,7527
7527,2,9,Barney ,"Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment.",41,7528
7528,2,9,Marshall ,The 'oh' moment?,42,7529
7529,2,9,Barney ,"Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker.",43,7530
7530,2,9,,Girl #1: It's a promise ring. I made a pact with God to stay a virgin till I'm married.,44,7531
7531,2,9,Barney ,Oh.,45,7532
7532,2,9,,"Girl #2: I don't have an eating disorder. It's just when I put food in my mouth, I chew it and then I spit it out.",46,7533
7533,2,9,Barney ,Oh.,47,7534
7534,2,9,,Girl #3: I just turned 30.,48,7535
7535,2,9,Barney ,Oh.,49,7536
7536,2,9,Barney ,"So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible.",50,7537
7537,2,9,Ted ,"I disagree. If there's some potential 'oh' moment, I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative?",51,7538
7538,2,9,Priest ,I now pronounce you man and wife.,52,7539
7539,2,9,Ted ,I love you.,53,7540
7540,2,9,Robin ,I used to be a dude.,54,7541
7541,2,9,Lily ,"Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets.",55,7542
7542,2,9,Barney ,"You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox.",56,7543
7543,2,9,Ted ,It's true. They tell each other everything.,57,7544
7544,2,9,Barney ,I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you,58,7545
7545,2,9,Lily ,Try me.,59,7546
7546,2,9,Barney ,Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?,60,7547
7547,2,9,Lily ,Doggie ate his pants. Yep.,61,7548
7548,2,9,Barney ,Bill's bachelor party in Memphis.,62,7549
7549,2,9,Lily ,"Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?",63,7550
7550,2,9,Barney ,"OK, Seattle.",64,7551
7551,2,9,Lily ,"Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch.",65,7552
7552,2,9,Barney ,Damn.,66,7553
7553,2,9,Marshall ,I'm not afraid of Sasquatch. I just think we should all be on alert.,67,7554
7554,2,9,Ted ,"Trust me, not only do they tell each other everything. They want to know everything.",68,7555
7555,2,9,Marshall ,"So, after the shower, I was brushing my teeth, and I was like, oh man, I wanted to have some orange juice, I should have done that first, but I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush so I just went ahead and brushed them anyway.",69,7556
7556,2,9,Lily ,What happened next?,70,7557
7557,2,9,,"(back to present scene) Ted: Yeah, meanwhile, Robin tells me nothing.",71,7558
7558,2,9,Barney ,"Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?",72,7559
7559,2,9,Ted ,You know?,73,7560
7560,2,9,Barney ,"Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p*rn, wait for it, ography.",74,7561
7561,2,9,Ted ,"Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous.",75,7562
7562,2,9,Lily ,"I don't know, he could be right. She does have the fake orgasm noises down.",76,7563
7563,2,9,Ted ,Hey.,77,7564
7564,2,9,Lily ,What? The walls are thin.,78,7565
7565,2,9,Ted ,That's not what I'm hey-ing you about.,79,7566
7566,2,9,Marshall ,You know what it might be. This is gonna sound a little crazy but what if robin's married?,80,7567
7567,2,9,Ted ,Married? What does have to do with the mall?,81,7568
7568,2,9,Marshall ,"Well, maybe she got married at the mall. Back home in Minnesota a ton of people would get married at the Mall of America, it's great. It's a gorgeous indoor golf course for pictures. Numerous fine dining options, and talk about a reasonable price...",82,7569
7569,2,9,Lily ,We're not getting married at the mall.,83,7570
7570,2,9,Marshall ,Just meet with the guy.,84,7571
7571,2,9,Ted ,She's not married. Robin hates marriage.,85,7572
7572,2,9,Marshall ,"Because she already got married, at the mall.",86,7573
7573,2,9,Lily ,"No, because before Robin moved to New York, she...What was she doing?",87,7574
7574,2,9,Ted ,"Well, I don't know, whenever I ask her about Canada, she kinda clams up.",88,7575
7575,2,9,Marshall ,She's a pretty private person.,89,7576
7576,2,9,Lily ,Except when she's talking about...,90,7577
7577,2,9,Robin ,A friend of mine in Canada got married way too young and it really turned her off to marriage.,91,7578
7578,2,9,Lily ,What do you think of this wedding cake?,92,7579
7579,2,9,Robin ,"Oh, I like it. Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada who got married too young? Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Field's giant cookie.",93,7580
7580,2,9,Lily ,No.,94,7581
7581,2,9,Robin ,"My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.",95,7582
7582,2,9,Barney ,They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess.,96,7583
7583,2,9,Ted ,"So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada?",97,7584
7584,2,9,Marshall ,"Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted.",98,7585
7585,2,9,Barney ,"Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it.",99,7586
7586,2,9,Ted ,Thank you Barney.,100,7587
7587,2,9,Barney ,'Cause it's p*rn.,101,7588
7588,2,9,Ted ,I need another beer.,102,7589
7589,2,9,Marshall ,Robin is not in p*rn. I'll bet you anything that she's married.,103,7590
7590,2,9,Barney ,"20,000 says it's p*rn.",104,7591
7591,2,9,Marshall ,"I don't have 20,000.",105,7592
7592,2,9,Barney ,"Well then, what do you have?",106,7593
7593,2,9,Marshall ,Well.,107,7594
7594,2,9,Lily ,No.,108,7595
7595,2,9,Barney ,I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet.,109,7596
7596,2,9,Ted ,"Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid.",110,7597
7597,2,9,Lily ,What the hell's a slap bet?,111,7598
7598,2,9,Marshall ,"Whoever's right gets to slap the other person in the face as hard as they possibly can, but no rings.",112,7599
7599,2,9,Lily ,Are you really gonna do that? That's so immature. Marshall: You can be Slap Bet Commissioner.,113,7600
7600,2,9,Lily ,"Oh, I love it. What are my powers?",114,7601
7601,2,9,Marshall ,"Um, if a problem arises and we need a ruling, that's your job. Barney: But you have to be unbiased and put the integrity of slap bet above all else. This is an honor you will take with you to your grave. On your tombstone, it will read ""Lily Aldrin, caring wife, loving friend, Slap Bet Commissioner.""",115,7602
7602,2,9,Marshall ,"And your tombstone will read, ""got slapped by Marshall so hard, he died.""",116,7603
7603,2,9,Ted ,"All right, what if I ask Robin point-blank if she has a husband?",117,7604
7604,2,9,Lily ,You said you would respect her privacy so maybe you should just drop it.,118,7605
7605,2,9,Ted ,"Yeah, you're right.",119,7606
7606,2,9,Ted ,Husband.,120,7607
7607,2,9,Robin ,There's no 'p' in husband.,121,7608
7608,2,9,Ted ,"Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands.",122,7609
7609,2,9,Ted ,"Fine, I'll take it back.",123,7610
7610,2,9,Ted ,"Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada.",124,7611
7611,2,9,Robin ,Huh.,125,7612
7612,2,9,Ted ,"I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that?",126,7613
7613,2,9,Robin ,"Are you asking me if I'm married? Ted: You can ask me. Nope, I'm not married. Your turn.",127,7614
7614,2,9,Robin ,"What happened to respecting my privacy? Ted: Just say, ""no, I'm not married.""",128,7615
7615,2,9,Robin ,"Ted, I don't understand why you can't...",129,7616
7616,2,9,Ted ,"Just say, ""no, I'm not married.""",130,7617
7617,2,9,Robin ,"I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married.",131,7618
7618,2,9,Ted ,Oh.,132,7619
7619,2,9,Ted ,You have a husband? Robin: I was young and stupid and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall and I haven't been to a mall since.,133,7620
7620,2,9,Ted ,Why didn't you get divorced?,134,7621
7621,2,9,Robin ,"He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough.",135,7622
7622,2,9,Ted ,"Good... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough.",136,7623
7623,2,9,Robin ,I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this.,137,7624
7624,2,9,Ted ,OK.,138,7625
7625,2,9,Barney ,Your hand is monstrous.,139,7626
7626,2,9,Marshall ,"Well, what did you expect? You've seen my pen1s.",140,7627
7627,2,9,Lily ,I can't believe you told us Robin's secret.,141,7628
7628,2,9,Ted ,How can I keep something like that to myself? And you begged me to tell you.,142,7629
7629,2,9,Lily ,No I didn't.,143,7630
7630,2,9,Lily ,"Please tell us, just tell us. I'm begging you. Tell us, tell us, tell us, please, please, please, please, please.",144,7631
7631,2,9,Ted ,"Fine, Robin's married.",145,7632
7632,2,9,Marshall ,Ha ha ha.,146,7633
7633,2,9,Lily ,"Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us. I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you?",147,7634
7634,2,9,Ted ,"See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?",148,7635
7635,2,9,Barney ,I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress.,149,7636
7636,2,9,Ted ,What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce?,150,7637
7637,2,9,Lily ,"Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage. It's like their money or their army. Nobody takes it seriously.",151,7638
7638,2,9,Ted ,It's serious to me.,152,7639
7639,2,9,Marshall ,"You know what, in some countries, if you've been separated for longer than five years, technicall, you're no longer married. I can check it out at the law library at school.",153,7640
7640,2,9,Marshall ,I can see my hand print on your face.,154,7641
7641,2,9,Barney ,"Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of p*rn from Canada I have to go through.",155,7642
7642,2,9,Marshall ,I won the bet. Why are you still searching?,156,7643
7643,2,9,Barney ,Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong.,157,7644
7644,2,9,Lily ,"Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch p*rn.",158,7645
7645,2,9,Barney ,"Canadian p*rn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go ""oat"" of my mind.",159,7646
7646,2,9,Ted ,Hey.,160,7647
7647,2,9,Marshall ,"Hey. Listen, dude, I gotta talk to you, but you gotta promise me that you won't tell Barney.",161,7648
7648,2,9,Ted ,"Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it?",162,7649
7649,2,9,Marshall ,Robin's not married.,163,7650
7650,2,9,Ted ,"What? Then, why would she tell me she was?",164,7651
7651,2,9,Marshall ,I don't know but I cross-checked every record in Canada. There's no record of her ever being married.,165,7652
7652,2,9,Ted ,There must be some mistake.,166,7653
7653,2,9,Marshall ,"I promise you, she's not married. She's not great at parking legally either.",167,7654
7654,2,9,Ted ,"So, she lied to me? What, what am I gonna do? I can't confront her 'cause then she'll know I told you.",168,7655
7655,2,9,Marshall ,"You gotta lawyer her. You gotta ask her a bunch of questions, try to trip her up, maybe make her feel guilty, whatever it takes to get a confession out of her.",169,7656
7656,2,9,Ted ,"Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest.",170,7657
7657,2,9,Robin ,Thanks Ted.,171,7658
7658,2,9,Ted ,"Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is.",172,7659
7659,2,9,Robin ,I say we just move on.,173,7660
7660,2,9,Ted ,"In order for me to get total closure on this whole my-girlfriend-has-a-husband thing, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more information. Like, what month did you get married? Robin: June. We had a June wedding.",174,7661
7661,2,9,Ted ,"Ah, Canada in June. That's great.",175,7662
7662,2,9,Ted ,Sit down or buffet.,176,7663
7663,2,9,Robin ,Um...,177,7664
7664,2,9,Ted ,Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember.,178,7665
7665,2,9,Robin ,"No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc.",179,7666
7666,2,9,Ted ,Hm. Band of DJ?,180,7667
7667,2,9,Robin ,"String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.",181,7668
7668,2,9,Ted ,How many bridesmaids? Robin: Seven.,182,7669
7669,2,9,Ted ,Flowers? Robin: Azaleas.,183,7670
7670,2,9,Ted ,Color scheme?,184,7671
7671,2,9,Robin ,Dusty rose and sienna.,185,7672
7672,2,9,Ted ,Husband's name?,186,7673
7673,2,9,Robin ,Um.,187,7674
7674,2,9,Ted ,You were never married.,188,7675
7675,2,9,Robin ,Yes I was.,189,7676
7676,2,9,Ted ,No you weren't.,190,7677
7677,2,9,Robin ,How do you know?,191,7678
7678,2,9,Ted ,I looked it up at the library.,192,7679
7679,2,9,Robin ,What library?,193,7680
7680,2,9,Ted ,The one on 5th.,194,7681
7681,2,9,Robin ,When did you go?,195,7682
7682,2,9,Ted ,Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad....,196,7683
7683,2,9,Robin ,"I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use?",197,7684
7684,2,9,Ted ,I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.,198,7685
7685,2,9,,"(Robin looks at Ted) Ted: Fine, Marshall looked it up in school.",199,7686
7686,2,9,Robin ,You told Marshall?,200,7687
7687,2,9,Ted ,You lied to me!,201,7688
7688,2,9,Robin ,"See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret.",202,7689
7689,2,9,Ted ,But it was a fake secret.,203,7690
7690,2,9,Robin ,"Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too.",204,7691
7691,2,9,Ted ,"Testing me, that's insane.",205,7692
7692,2,9,Robin ,"Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world?",206,7693
7693,2,9,Ted ,That wasn't a real secret.,207,7694
7694,2,9,Robin ,"Yeah, but it could have been.",208,7695
7695,2,9,Ted ,You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.,209,7696
7696,2,9,Robin ,He moved there for business.,210,7697
7697,2,9,Barney ,"You, you got something to say to me?",211,7698
7698,2,9,Marshall ,What are you talking about? Barney: I know Robin was never really married.,212,7699
7699,2,9,Marshall ,How could you possibly know that?,213,7700
7700,2,9,,(flashback of Lily and Marshall talking in bed) Lily: And then I put on my pajamas and got into bed. What about you?,214,7701
7701,2,9,Marshall ,"Uh, let's see. Uh, first, I took the subway to school, and I got a bagel. Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married. Crazy. And then I was hungry again so I went down to the vending machine...",215,7702
7702,2,9,Marshall ,"You told him? Lily: I had to. I'm Slap Bet Commissioner. Baby, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you.",216,7703
7703,2,9,Barney ,Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.,217,7704
7704,2,9,Lily ,Barney gets three slaps.,218,7705
7705,2,9,Marshall ,Three?,219,7706
7706,2,9,Lily ,One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.,220,7707
7707,2,9,Barney ,Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall: No. You're gonna cry.,221,7708
7708,2,9,Ted ,I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.,222,7709
7709,2,9,Robin ,"I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.",223,7710
7710,2,9,Barney ,So I just got a very interesting phone call.,224,7711
7711,2,9,Ted ,What are you talking about?,225,7712
7712,2,9,Barney ,I know Robin's secret.,226,7713
7713,2,9,Robin ,What?,227,7714
7714,2,9,Barney ,"That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now.",228,7715
7715,2,9,Barney ,"Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this.",229,7716
7716,2,9,Ted ,Yeah. No I don't.,230,7717
7717,2,9,Barney ,What?,231,7718
7718,2,9,Ted ,Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.,232,7719
7719,2,9,Barney ,"Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!",233,7720
7720,2,9,Barney ,"Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing.",234,7721
7721,2,9,Robin ,"Barney, don't, okay.",235,7722
7722,2,9,Barney ,"Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right.",236,7723
7723,2,9,Ted ,"No, Barney, I said we're not watching this.",237,7724
7724,2,9,Robin ,"No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it.",238,7725
7725,2,9,Lily ,Are you as terrified as I am?,239,7726
7726,2,9,Marshall ,I don't wanna get slapped again.,240,7727
7727,2,9,Robin ,I wanna stress that I was young.,241,7728
7728,2,9,Barney ,Yeah you were.,242,7729
7729,2,9,Robin ,And I didn't know any better.,243,7730
7730,2,9,Barney ,They never do.,244,7731
7731,2,9,Robin ,And it started out as an innocent modeling job.,245,7732
7732,2,9,Barney ,It always does.,246,7733
7733,2,9,Robin Sparkles," Please, Mr. Johnson, I'm sorry I was a bad girl. Please don't give me detention. Isn't there something I can do to make it up to you?",247,7734
7734,2,9,Ted ,Oh my God.,248,7735
7735,2,9,Barney ,"Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock.",249,7736
7736,2,9,Robin ,What the hell was that?,250,7737
7737,2,9,Ted ,"I slap bet Marshall that you did p*rn, so I win.",251,7738
7738,2,9,Robin ,"p*rn? I wish it was p*rn, it would be less embarrassing.",252,7739
7739,2,9,Robin Sparkles," I know, how about I sing you a song!",253,7740
7740,2,9,Robin Sparkles," Let's go the mall everybody! Come on, Jessica. Come on, Tori.",254,7741
7741,2,9,Robin ,I was a teenage pop star in Canada.,255,7742
7742,2,9,Robin Sparkles," Put on your jelly bracelets and your cool graffiti coat. At the mall, having fun is what it's all about.",256,7743
7743,2,9,Lily ,This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.,257,7744
7744,2,9,Marshall ,That's you?,258,7745
7745,2,9,Robin ,Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.,259,7746
7746,2,9,Robin Sparkles," Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today.",260,7747
7747,2,9,Marshall ,This is the 90's. Why does it look like 1986?,261,7748
7748,2,9,Robin ,The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93.,262,7749
7749,2,9,Marshall ,"Taking a break from the first of many viewings, I can't help but notice that this isn't p*rn.",263,7750
7750,2,9,Lily ,And yet a slap occurred without the permission of the Slap Bet Commissioner.,264,7751
7751,2,9,Marshall ,Looks like someone suffered from premature slapulation,265,7752
7752,2,9,Ted ,"Oh my God, Robin's rapping. Guys, Robin's rapping.",266,7753
7753,2,9,Robin Sparkles, Went to the mall with a couple of friends. Had a whole week's allowance to spend.,267,7754
7754,2,9,Lily ,"OK, I'm going to give you a choice. Either ten slaps right now in a row or five slaps that can be doled at any point from here to eternity.",268,7755
7755,2,9,,"Marshall, Ted: Cool.",269,7756
7756,2,9,Ted ,Go with the 10 now.,270,7757
7757,2,9,Robin ,"No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?",271,7758
7758,2,9,Ted ,"Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.",272,7759
7759,2,9,Barney ,I'm gonna go with the five for eternity.,273,7760
7760,2,9,Robin ,Good call.,274,7761
7761,2,9,Ted ,Horrible call.,275,7762
7762,2,9,Marshall ,"Relax, dude, I'm just going for my soda, man. Take it easy. This is gonna be fun.",276,7763
7763,2,9,Robin Sparkles, Let's go to the mall today! Everybody loves the mall,277,7764
7764,2,9,Lily ,"So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?",278,7765
7765,2,9,Barney ,"Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin: I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket.",279,7766
7766,2,9,Ted ,"Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone.",280,7767
7767,2,9,Robin ,"You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice.",281,7768
7768,2,9,,"Lily, Marshall, Barney: Aw.",282,7769
7769,2,9,Marshall ,That's one.,283,7770
7770,2,9,Robin Sparkles," Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today!",284,7771
7771,2,9,Barney ,Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin: Yes.,285,7772
7772,2,9,Robin Sparkles, There's this boy I like. Met him at the food court. He's got hair like Gretzky and he does jumps on his skateboard. I hope he asks me out. Take me to my favorite spot. It'll be just him and me.,286,7773
7773,2,9,Robot ,But don't forget the robot.,287,7774
7774,2,9,Marshall ,The robot! Hey!,288,7775

7826,2,10,Lily ,And then there was the time they scored the brother/sister combo.,49,7827
7827,2,10,Barney ,It was everything we ever dreamed of when watching Donnie and Marie. She was a little bit country.,50,7828
7828,2,10,James , He was a little bit way into black guys.,51,7829

7893,2,10,Marshall ,"Yeah, he's turning down shots, he's yawning, he's whining about his feet. He's as bad as we are.",116,7894
7894,2,10,Ted ,"He is. Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are. You guys don't think that James is... in a relationship?",117,7895
7895,2,10,Robin ,No. There's no way. He's Barney's brother.,118,7896
7896,2,10,Marshall ,Look at that. He's texting!,119,7897
7897,2,10,Ted ,"Oh, my God! He is in a couple.",120,7898
7898,2,10,Lily ,This is gonna k*ll Barney.,121,7899
7899,2,10,Barney ,What's gonna k*ll me? What's going on?,122,7900
7900,2,10,Marshall ,B-Barney? Have you noticed anything...different about James?,123,7901
7901,2,10,Barney ,"No. I mean, he's glowing from his peel, if that's what you mean.",124,7902
7902,2,10,Ted ,"We have reason to believe that James is, uh, maybe hiding something from you. I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but... Barney... your brother is...monogamous.",125,7903
7903,2,10,Barney ,"That's ridiculous! Just because he's a little sleepy, and he hasn't had s*x with anyone in a bathroom stall... He hasn't had s*x with anyone in a bathroom stall.",126,7904
7904,2,10,Robin ,"And, Barney... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... he's texting.",127,7905
7905,2,10,Barney ,"No, he... No! That... is impossible. Excuse... Excuse... Ex...",128,7906
7906,2,10,James ,"Hey, bro.",129,7907
7907,2,10,Barney ,Don't change the subject. Let me see your phone.,130,7908
7908,2,10,James ,Why?,131,7909
7909,2,10,Barney ,I just want to see your phone. Let me see your phone.,132,7910
7910,2,10,James ,"No, it's just a phone. It's just a phone! And it's got Internet access, and it's got a camera on it, and you can surf the Web and do the whole thing. It's so amazing how far technology has come. What kind of phone do you have?",133,7911
7911,2,10,Barney ,"I got... Who is this? And the answer better be: ""I don't remember his name.""",134,7912
7912,2,10,James ,That is Tom. And he's my fiancé.,135,7913
7913,2,10,James ,Hey.,136,7914
7914,2,10,Barney ,I don't support this.,137,7915
7915,2,10,James ,Gay marriage?,138,7916
7916,2,10,Barney ,"Not gay marriage-- marriage! How can you do this?We were raised in the same house, with the same values!",139,7917
7917,2,10,James ,"Believe me, I fought this for a long time. Come on, it's embarrassing. Look, this felt unnatural to me, too, at first. But I fell in love. And Tom and I realized you can't fight love.",140,7918
7918,2,10,Barney ,"Oh, God. Is that what you two do together? You sit around the house and talk about love? I think... I'm gonna be sick.",141,7919
7919,2,10,James ,"Okay, okay, look,I need you to wrap your head around this, okay? Because it is happening. And I want you to be my best man.",142,7920
7920,2,10,Barney ,What? No way.,143,7921
7921,2,10,James ,"Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. I hope you change your mind.",144,7922
7922,2,10,Woman ,"Two beers, one shot.",145,7923
7923,2,10,Barney ,"Oh, it's a freaking epidemic.",146,7924
7924,2,10,Lily ,"Oh, sweetie! Did you make that for me?",147,7925
7925,2,10,Marshall ,Yes.,148,7926
7926,2,10,Barney ,"Clam Bake. Staten Island. Who's in? Okay, I didn't have high hopes for that one. Okay, here's my thing. If gay guys start getting married, then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it. That's how it works. They start something, then six months later, everyone follows. Like now everyone gets manicures.",149,7927
7927,2,10,Ted ,I don't get manicures.,150,7928
7928,2,10,Barney ,"Okay, then like how... Like getting your chest waxed.",151,7929
7929,2,10,Lily ,You get your chest waxed?,152,7930
7930,2,10,Barney ,"You know what I mean! Gay marriage is going to cause single life, as we know it, to die out. Think of how the American family will be strengthened.",153,7931
7931,2,10,Marshall ,"Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up and be a man about this.",154,7932
7932,2,10,Barney ,"No. It's always been me and him together, being awesome, while the rest of you walked two-by-two onto your ark of sexless boredom.",155,7933
7933,2,10,Marshall ,Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change.,156,7934
7934,2,10,Barney ,Yeah. Like things haven't changed with you people.,157,7935
7935,2,10,Ted ,"Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like. Sandals and socks--come on, buddy. But I took her out, we celebrated. It was the right thing to do. You got to support him.",158,7936
7936,2,10,Barney ,"You're right, Ted. This is a cause for celebration. We need to take him out and celebrate the commitment he and Tom are about to make.",159,7937
7937,2,10,James ,Yeah. This is where we're celebrating the commitment that Tom and I are about to make?,160,7938
7938,2,10,Barney ,"What? Yeah! See, that cage represents your commitment.",161,7939
7939,2,10,Marshall ,"Oh, my God. Freedom has never tasted so delicious.",162,7940
7940,2,10,Man ,Hey. You work out?,163,7941
7941,2,10,Marshall ,I do. And thank you for noticing. You're obviously in very good shape yourself.,164,7942
7942,2,10,Man ,"Well, I try. So you want to dance?",165,7943
7943,2,10,Marshall ,"You know what? I'm very flattered, and, objectively, you're a very attractive man, but this is actually my fiancée.",166,7944
7944,2,10,Man ,"I'm sorry. You know, I saw your drink and I...",167,7945
7945,2,10,Marshall ,"No, no, this isn't my drink. This is hers.",168,7946
7946,2,10,Lily ,"No, it isn't.",169,7947
7947,2,10,Man ,Whatever. How 'bout you?,170,7948
7948,2,10,Ted ,"Oh, I'm straight, too. But I thank you for your time, and I appreciate your interest in my body.",171,7949
7949,2,10,Marshall ,"You see that? Being hit on doesn't have to be terrible. I feel flattered, and everyone left with their dignity.",172,7950
7950,2,10,Man ,"Hey, I really like your sweater.",173,7951
7951,2,10,Robin ,"Wow. You actually do, don't you? You're not checking out my boobs or anything.",174,7952
7952,2,10,Man ,"My name's Gay Ken, what do you think?",175,7953
7953,2,10,Robin ,I love this place! Let's dance!,176,7954
7954,2,10,Lily , - And not be groped!,177,7955
7955,2,10,Robin ,- Whoo! Thank you.,178,7956
7956,2,10,Ted ,- Thank you!,179,7957
7957,2,10,Marshall ,- We're hot.,180,7958
7958,2,10,Ted ,- Totally.,181,7959
7959,2,10,James ," And then Tom says to the dealer that the handmade Georgian clock has a chip on the corner. Blam, we get that puppy half price. What up?! Bam!",182,7960
7960,2,10,Barney ,Sounds like you really rocked that arts and crafts fair.,183,7961
7961,2,10,James ,"Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Hey, oh, my God. This is so liberating, being able to talk about this to you. I cannot wait for you to meet Tom.",184,7962
7962,2,10,Barney ,"And I cannot wait for you to meet my good friend... this guy. Excuse me, do you know anyone who would like to buy my incredibly muscular, fun, large-handed brother a drink?",185,7963
7963,2,10,James ,"Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you, Barnaby. Okay. All right. I spy a group of women who have let their defenses down because they are in a gay club. You see that chick right there? She looks like she'd fall for sports agent and football player.",186,7964
7964,2,10,Barney ,"Okay, I'm in. Which one am I?",187,7965
7965,2,10,James ,Please.,188,7966
7966,2,10,Barney ,"He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil, and drops his pants after three dirty martinis. Now go, man, go!",189,7967
7967,2,10,Marshall ,I just never thought I'd see Barney so vulnerable.,190,7968
7968,2,10,Ted ,"Well, I guess no one wants to feel like they're going through the world alone.",191,7969
7969,2,10,Man ,"Look at me, in a yummy sandwich!",192,7970
7970,2,10,Marshall ,"Okay, we're actually right in the middle of something right now, so...",193,7971
7971,2,10,Man ,"Ooh, I know what I want to be in the middle of. Thoughts?",194,7972
7972,2,10,Ted ,"God, can't two straight guys come to a gay dance club, enjoy some techno and good conversation without being bothered?",195,7973
7973,2,10,Robin ,"How's it going, guys? Still enjoying the attentions of men?",196,7974
7974,2,10,Marshall ,"That's like the eighth guy who's hit on us in ten minutes. It's like, hello,",197,7975
7975,2,10,Ted ,And it's never the hot ones. It's always the losers. Bums me out!,198,7976
7976,2,10,Lily ,Looks like the boys learned their lesson. Do you totally miss being hit on?,199,7977
7977,2,10,Robin ,"Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar.",200,7978
7978,2,10,Barney ,"James, James, since you like arts and crafts, look at what Charles here made with cherry stems. He did it with his tongue. Yeah.",201,7979
7979,2,10,James ,Barney.,202,7980
7980,2,10,Barney ,"So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone, and once he's in a funner mood...",203,7981
7981,2,10,James ,"Barney, Barney, I don't want his number. I don't want anyone's number, okay? I'm getting married.",204,7982
7982,2,10,Charles ,Wow.- Best of luck to you both.,205,7983
7983,2,10,James ,- Thank you.,206,7984
7984,2,10,Charles ,My number's in here. I'm very discreet.,207,7985
7985,2,10,James ,"Okay, okay, excuse me. Barney, family talk. Okay, dude, you have got to stop this, okay? I know that my getting married is threatening to your way of life...",208,7986
7986,2,10,Barney ,"Oh, so now it's my way of life? I thought it was our way of life. You've completely turned your back on it. Look at you, not even suited up. Do you remember why we suit up, James?",209,7987
7987,2,10,James ,To get laid.,210,7988
7988,2,10,Barney ,"To show people that we are different from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there. The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with, a two-person army that plays by its own rules. But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines, and you've abandoned me. Well, I'm not gonna let you do that. It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing! You don't have to do this, bro!",211,7989
7989,2,10,James ,"- Yes, I do.",212,7990
7990,2,10,Barney ,- Why?!,213,7991
7991,2,10,James ,Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby.,214,7992
7992,2,10,Barney ,What? There's gonna be a baby?,215,7993
7993,2,10,James ,Yes. We're adopting.,216,7994
7994,2,10,Barney ,"Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?",217,7995
7995,2,10,James ,For the rest of your life.,218,7996
7996,2,10,Barney ,To James and Tom. May you have a long and happy life together. And may I always have the skin and libido of a much younger man.- Cheers.,219,7997
7997,2,10,Tous ,- Cheers.,220,7998
7998,2,10,Barney ,Thanks. I decided to leave out the hetero college phase. No one wants to,221,7999
7999,2,10,Lily ,It was perfect. You even made Tom's dad cry. Might have been doing that because he's a Republican.,222,8000
8000,2,10,Marshall ,Whoa. It's 9:00. We should be getting back. You guys want to split a cab?,223,8001
8001,2,10,Ted ,"Uh, no, I think I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.",224,8002
8002,2,10,Robin ,"Yeah, me, too. I'm not tired at all.",225,8003
8003,2,10,Marshall ,"All right, well, it's getting late. Got to get the wife home.",226,8004
8004,2,10,Lily ,"Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat.",227,8005
8005,2,10,Barney ,"Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.",228,8006
8006,2,10,Barney ,- May I?,229,8007
8007,2,10,James ,- Yeah.,230,8008
8008,2,10,Barney ,"Hey, buddy. Your parents are married. Now, listen, you. Just because you're being raised by married people doesn't mean you have to choose that lifestyle. High-five. Luckily, you got me. In 20 and a half years, you'll be 21, and I will be... Well, I haven't decided how old I'll be yet. But we are gonna bro out, uncle and nephew style. Stick with me, kid. I am gonna teach you how to live. Great suit, by the way. Who is the cutest?",231,8009
8009,2,10,Rosa ,I don't get it. Tom liked my breasts in tenth grade. Why doesn't he like them now? Why?,232,8010
8010,2,10,Barney ,"Rosa, why always be attracted to the unavailable ones? Why not accept the fact that you're a beautiful woman who is worthy of love? Are you brave enough to hear that? You...",233,8011
8011,2,11,,"Ted (V.O.): Kids, as you know, Christmas is a time you spend with your family. So in December of 2006, I had three options. Spend it with my mom and her new boyfriend Clint, spend it with my dad and his new girlfriend micro-brewing, or head down to Staten Island to spend it with my super religious cousin Stacy and her family. So I opted for none of the above and decided to spend Christmas 2006 in Manhattan... celebrating with my other family.",1,8012
8012,2,11,Marshall ,"Okay, I have one last paper due at 5:00 p.m. today, so until then, I will be at the law library at school, but I'm not to be disturbed for any reason.",2,8013
8013,2,11,Ted ,"Dude, open your eyes. You're going to hurt yourself.",3,8014
8014,2,11,Marshall ,"No, no. Christmas Eve winter wonderland is my reward for finishing my paper. Baby, do I smell your Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies?",4,8015
8015,2,11,Lily ,Yes.,5,8016
8016,2,11,Marshall ,"Damn me and my heightened other senses. Must be strong. Okay, I'll be back here at 5:00. Save me at least 20 cookies and do not clean the bowl. Was that a reindeer? I don't want to know!",6,8017
8017,2,11,Lily ,"Hey, look. Our old answering machine.",7,8018
8018,2,11,Ted ,"Oh, yeah. After you left, we, uh, we unplugged it because it reminded Marshall of how you used to, you know, leave messages. But hey, you guys are back together. I say we're plugging it back in. It's good to have you back.",8,8019
8019,2,11,Lily ,"Thanks. Oh, hey, look, there's still some messages on here.",9,8020
8020,2,11,Ted's father," Hey Ted, it's Dad calling to check in. I'm going fishing this",10,8021
8021,2,11,Ted ,"Yes, same Clint.",11,8022
8022,2,11,,"Ted (voix dans le répondeur): Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the couch right now moping about Lily? You are, aren't you? Well, stop it. She's not worth it. You gotta get over that Grinch.",12,8023
8023,2,11,Ted (voix off) ,"But I didn't say ""Grinch."" I said a bad word. A very, very bad word.",13,8024
8024,2,11,Ted ,"Oh, fudge.",14,8025
8025,2,11,Ted (voix off) ,But I didn't say fudge.,15,8026
8026,2,11,Lily ,I'm... a what?,16,8027
8027,2,11,Ted ,"I-- That was Barney, that was Barney.",17,8028
8028,2,11,Lily ,"That was you, Ted.",18,8029
8029,2,11,Ted ,That was Marshall.,19,8030
8030,2,11,Lily ,Marshall left a message for Marshall?,20,8031
8031,2,11,Ted ,"You know, it may have been me, but it was so long ago. Man, that machine, it really garbles your voice.You know, it almost made it sound like I said...",21,8032
8032,2,11,Lily ,Why would you call me that?,22,8033
8033,2,11,Ted (voix off) ,It was a fair question. Marshall's breakup with Lily had sent him into a deep depression and nothing could get him out of it. Until one day...,23,8034
8034,2,11,Marshall ,She was perfect. I lost the perfect woman. I should have knocked her up when I had the chance.,24,8035
8035,2,11,Ted ,Okay. That's it. You're never going to get over her until you stop putting her on a pedestal. So no more ice cream until you tell me one thing that's wrong with Lily.,25,8036
8036,2,11,Marshall ,There's only one of her?,26,8037
8037,2,11,Ted ,Okay. She called off your wedding and dumped you to be a painter in San Francisco. What do you call that?,27,8038
8038,2,11,Marshall ,Fiercely independent? Brave? I guess it was a little selfish.,28,8039
8039,2,11,Ted ,There you go.,29,8040
8040,2,11,Ted (voix off) ,"And in almost no time, that spark turned into a roaring fire.",30,8041
8041,2,11,Marshall ,"Yeah. No, you're right. Lily would laugh at anything.",31,8042
8042,2,11,Barney ,"She'd give it up for a bad pun. I'm telling you, she's a laugh slut.",32,8043
8043,2,11,Ted ,"Remember that time we heard her laughing and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's, but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?",33,8044
8044,2,11,Barney ,"And her art? ""I'm Lily, I'm an artist."" She doesn't even own a beret.",34,8045
8045,2,11,Marshall ,"Yeah, and if she's such a great ""artist,"" why does she suck at Pictionary? Who draws a ninja star like a Star of David? Right, right?",35,8046
8046,2,11,Ted ,Yeah!,36,8047
8047,2,11,Marshall ,Another round!,37,8048
8048,2,11,Ted ,I was trying to help him. I'm his best friend. That's the best friend's job.,38,8049
8049,2,11,Lily ,The best friend's job is to call me that word?,39,8050
8050,2,11,Ted ,Yeah.,40,8051
8051,2,11,Robin ,"Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy boy.",41,8052
8052,2,11,Ted ,"Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word.",42,8053
8053,2,11,Barney ,Then why don't you say it now?,43,8054
8054,2,11,Ted ,Grinch. You timed that didn't you?,44,8055
8055,2,11,Barney ,Perfectly.,45,8056
8056,2,11,Robin ,"Well, at least you apologized. You apologized, didn't you?",46,8057
8057,2,11,Ted ,"Oh, yeah. ""I'm sorry"" were the first words out of my mouth.",47,8058
8058,2,11,Ted ,"I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing. I was just trying to put the guy back together. You smashed him to pieces.",48,8059
8059,2,11,Lily ,Are you seriously not going to apologize for leaving that message?,49,8060
8060,2,11,Ted ,No!,50,8061
8061,2,11,Lily ,Why not?,51,8062
8062,2,11,Ted ,"Because, Lily, this summer, you were kind of a Grinch.",52,8063
8063,2,11,Lily ,"Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby.",53,8064
8064,2,11,Barney ,Ted Vivian Mosby!,54,8065
8065,2,11,Ted ,That's not my middle name.,55,8066
8066,2,11,Barney ,Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?,56,8067
8067,2,11,Ted ,Like you've never said that word.,57,8068
8068,2,11,Barney ,I don't kiss your mother with my mouth. Yet. (Barney sneezes),58,8069
8069,2,11,Ted ,Are you sick?,59,8070
8070,2,11,Barney ,Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy?,60,8071
8071,2,11,Ted ,"No, I meant do you have a cold?",61,8072
8072,2,11,Barney ,"I'm fine. I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome and I had to get some of it out. Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time when people are lonely and desperate. It's the most wonderful time of the year.",62,8073
8073,2,11,Ted ,I should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve.,63,8074
8074,2,11,Robin ,"Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses? If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays.",64,8075
8075,2,11,Barney ,"I don't see any mistletoe, but... (He sneezes on her)",65,8076
8076,2,11,Woman ,"Oh! Oh, God!",66,8077
8077,2,11,Barney ,"Uh... ""Bless you"" would have been nice.",67,8078
8078,2,11,Robin ,You're sick.,68,8079
8079,2,11,Barney ,I'm not sick.,69,8080
8080,2,11,Robin ,You're sick.,70,8081
8081,2,11,Barney ,You know what? I am sick. Sick of you telling me I'm sick. What up?,71,8082
8082,2,11,Ted ,"Ahh... Three flights of stairs, not a drop spilled. Hey, buddy.",72,8083
8083,2,11,Robin ,You sure this is gonna work?,73,8084
8084,2,11,Ted ,"Yeah, this is our thing. In college, whenever I wanted to make up with her, I'd buy her a beer. Cute, right?",74,8085
8085,2,11,Robin ,Totally. Plus free mug.,75,8086
8086,2,11,Ted (voix off) ,"Usually that would've done the trick, but it turned out this was a problem not even alcohol could solve. Actually the beer helped a little.",76,8087
8087,2,11,Ted ,She took the decorations. She took the decorations! What a Grinch!,77,8088
8088,2,11,Ted (voix off) ,"That time I did say ""Grinch.""",78,8089
8089,2,11,Ted ,"All right. I guess I have to call her, right? Lily's cell phone. She'll listen to reason-- right? Oh, hey, Billy. Actually, funny thing--the voice dial got you. I was trying to call... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. (20 minutes later) Yeah, the holidays are a rough time for everyone, Billy. Okay, yeah, dinner next Wednesday. Okay. Damn voice dial.",79,8090
8090,2,11,Robin ,"Barney! What the hell are you doing? Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane?",80,8091
8091,2,11,Barney ,"Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive ""no cigars in the apartment rule."" God, it's like Marshall's marrying the Taliban. (he sneezes on his hand). High five.",81,8092
8092,2,11,Robin ,Eww. No. You have to go home and get to bed.,82,8093
8093,2,11,Barney ,"Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north, let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body. You see, whenever I start feeling sick, I just stop being sick and be awesome instead. True story. Yeah, in two minutes, I'm going to pound a sixer of Red Bull, hop in a cab, play a couple of hours of laser tag, maybe get a spray-on tan. It's gonna be legen... Wait for it... (Barney falls asleep)",83,8094
8094,2,11,Ted ,Lily!,84,8095
8095,2,11,Lily ,"Merry Christmas, assface.",85,8096
8096,2,11,Ted ,"Um, Lily? Where are the Christmas decorations?",86,8097
8097,2,11,Lily ,At my apartment.,87,8098
8098,2,11,Ted ,You want to bring them back so we can celebrate Christmas together-- please?,88,8099
8099,2,11,Lily ,"Ted, do you know what I would do if one of my kindergartners used that kind of language? I would be on the phone with their parents.",89,8100
8100,2,11,Ted ,"Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.",90,8101
8101,2,11,Lily ,Exactly. You know what that word means. You know that calling people names is mean and hurtful... assface.,91,8102
8102,2,11,Ted ,"Lily, if you don't bring that stuff back right now, we...",92,8103
8103,2,11,Ted to Robin, She hung up.,93,8104
8104,2,11,Robin ,She's just mad. She'll cool down.,94,8105
8105,2,11,Ted ,Lily...,95,8106
8106,2,11,Lily ,Don't forget to take the cookies out of the oven... assface!,96,8107
8107,2,11,Ted ,Damn it! I could be in Cleveland right now making peppermint lager with my dad.,97,8108
8108,2,11,Robin ,Where are you going?,98,8109
8109,2,11,Ted ,"Marshall gets home in three hours. He's gonna show up--no Lily, no winter wonderland.I gotta get up to the Bronx.",99,8110
8110,2,11,,Barney:...dary.,100,8111
8111,2,11,Ted ,"Hey, dude, how's the paper going?",101,8112
8112,2,11,Marshall ,"Screw the paper, how's the winter wonderland? Is it magical?",102,8113
8113,2,11,Ted ,Oh... so magical.,103,8114
8114,2,11,Marshall ,"When you walk through the door, does it feel like you've been slapped in the face by Christmas?",104,8115
8115,2,11,Ted ,"Sure does. Look, I gotta go.",105,8116
8116,2,11,Marshall ,"Come on, man, describe it! Tell me about the decorations. Is Rudolph there? He is, isn't he? Hi, Rudolph!",106,8117
8117,2,11,Ted ,"Ah, yeah, but, you know... decorations, is that really what Christmas is about?",107,8118
8118,2,11,Marshall ,"Hell, yeah! What else would it be about?",108,8119
8119,2,11,Ted ,"Uh, try the birth of Christ. You know, Christmas-- Christ Mas, which means ""More Christ"" to our Spanish friends.",109,8120
8120,2,11,Marshall ,"Yeah, well, all I know is walking in that door and seeing the winter wonderland and seeing Lily and all you guys, just... I can't wait.",110,8121
8121,2,11,Ted ,Right. I gotta go.,111,8122
8122,2,11,Marshall ,"Right. Okay.Oh, wait. Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted. One more thing. How about the cookies? Are they delicious?",112,8123
8123,2,11,Ted ,"You know, honestly, they taste a little store-bought. Oh! I got another call.",113,8124
8124,2,11,Marshall ,"Well, tell Lily I love her.",114,8125
8125,2,11,Ted , Right. (he hangs up end takes the other call)- Hello?,115,8126
8126,2,11,His mother, Ted Evelyn Mosby!,116,8127
8127,2,11,Ted ,"Oh. Uh, hey, Mom. Merry Christmas.",117,8128
8128,2,11,His mother, I just got the most disturbing call from Lily. How could you use such a horrible word?,118,8129
8129,2,11,Ted ,"Oh, God, she called you?",119,8130
8130,2,11,His mother, Are you acting out because of the divorce? Is-is this all about Clint?,120,8131
8131,2,11,Ted ,"No, Mom, why would it be about Clint?",121,8132
8132,2,11,Clint ,"Hey, buddy, it's Clint. How you doing, champ?",122,8133
8133,2,11,Ted ,"Hey, Clint. Listen, um, I don't really have time to...",123,8134
8134,2,11,Clint ,"Hey, hey, no, no, no. Ted, Ted. You don't know this yet, but you and I are going to be great friends. Now, the Native Americans have this ritual...",124,8135
8135,2,11,Barney ,"This is a low moment for the Barnacle. I should be off playing laser tag right now, but instead... Don't look at me. I'm hideous.",125,8136
8136,2,11,Robin ,You just look like a regular guy.,126,8137
8137,2,11,Barney ,Exactly. I'm a Ted. I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants.,127,8138
8138,2,11,Robin ,And isn't it more comfy?,128,8139
8139,2,11,Barney ,Yes.,129,8140
8140,2,11,Robin ,"Come on, you need eat something.",130,8141
8141,2,11,Barney ,Too weak... to hold... bowl.,131,8142
8142,2,11,Robin ,"Fine, I'll feed you.",132,8143
8143,2,11,Barney ,Ouchie in my mouth! I don't want it. I want ice cream.,133,8144
8144,2,11,Robin ,"No, you're not having ice cream for dinner just 'cause you're sick.",134,8145
8145,2,11,Barney ,But my throat hurts.,135,8146
8146,2,11,Robin ,No!,136,8147
8147,2,11,Barney ,I hate you!,137,8148
8148,2,11,Barney ,Don't leave me.,138,8149
8149,2,11,Lily ,Who is this?,139,8150
8150,2,11,Ted ,Pizza delivery.,140,8151
8151,2,11,Lily ,"Hey, you tricked me.",141,8152
8152,2,11,Ted ,You really thought I was the pizza delivery guy?,142,8153
8153,2,11,Lily ,"No, I knew it was you. I just thought you'd at least bring a pizza.",143,8154
8154,2,11,Ted ,"Yeah, well, I brought a beer, but I gave it to a homeless guy. All right, he took it from me. Now, will you please come home?",144,8155
8155,2,11,Lily ,"No, I'm not spending Christmas with you.",145,8156
8156,2,11,Ted ,"Okay, I'm sorry for calling you a... that word, over the summer, and for saying it again today. And for thinking it a lot on the subway ride over. I had no right to say that. It was hurtful and immature and I'm sorry.",146,8157
8157,2,11,Lily ,"Oh, shut up. You think I don't know your fake apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh? You're clearly still mad at me.",147,8158
8158,2,11,Ted ,I'm not mad at you.,148,8159
8159,2,11,Lily ,"Yes, you are.",149,8160
8160,2,11,Ted ,"I am not mad at you, Lily. Now, can we please just...",150,8161
8161,2,11,Lily ,I've apologized to Marshall and he's forgiven me and we've moved passed it. Why can't you?,151,8162
8162,2,11,Ted ,"Because you never apologized to me. Marshall's not the only one you walked out on. You leave for three months, you don't even call. Come on, Lily, we're supposed to be friends!",152,8163
8163,2,11,Lily ,"Yeah, some friend, you called me a Grinch.",153,8164
8164,2,11,Ted ,You were a Grinch!,154,8165
8165,2,11,Lily ,How can you...,155,8166
8166,2,11,Ted ,"Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.",156,8167
8167,2,11,Lily ,"Happy? Now, you've pissed off the big guy upstairs.",157,8168
8168,2,11,Ted ,"Yeah, I'm sure God cares if I...",158,8169
8169,2,11,Voice ,You use that language again and I'll turn off your water!,159,8170
8170,2,11,Lily ,"That's my super. He lives above me. Great. Thanks to your filthy mouth, now I'm going to have Christmas alone in the dark.",160,8171
8171,2,11,Ted ,Fine. I don't want to ruin Christmas. You can have the apartment. Don't worry about seeing me there I'll be in Staten Island with my cousin Stacy. Just.... Merry Christmas.,161,8172
8172,2,11,Robin (on the phone) ,"You're spending Christmas Eve with your family? Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry.",162,8173
8173,2,11,Ted ,"Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird. You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees. And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name when he wants to trick us.",163,8174
8174,2,11,Robin ,"Well, do you want me to go with you?",164,8175
8175,2,11,Ted ,Was that a sincere offer?,165,8176
8176,2,11,Robin ,First tell me your answer.,166,8177
8177,2,11,Ted ,"Stay there. Save yourself. We'll spend all day together tomorrow. Okay. Oh, how's Barney feeling?",167,8178
8178,2,11,Robin ,"You mean the whiney bottomless pit of neediness? He was bugging me, so I spiked his echinacea tea with codeine.",168,8179
8179,2,11,Ted ,You're gonna be a great mom.,169,8180
8180,2,11,Marshall ,"Holy crap, the magical Christmas season is upon us. And thank God we don't pay for utilities.",170,8181
8181,2,11,Lily ,Merry Christmas! What's in the box?,171,8182
8182,2,11,Marshall ,Only the best present for the best girl ever. It took me all day to track it down.,172,8183
8183,2,11,Lily ,I thought you were writing a paper.,173,8184
8184,2,11,Marshall ,"Ah, naw, I blew that off. I'll get an extension. School's not important. What is that pitter patter on the roof? Could it be the sound of an awesome Christmas story about to come down the chimney? Why, yes, it is. 'Twas the day before Christmas...",174,8185
8185,2,11,Marshall ,"It was supposed to arrive, like, five days ago, but then it got lost and rerouted. I checked two other branches, finally they told me it was here.",175,8186
8186,2,11,Women ,"Yeah, all I needed to know was the tracking number. Looks like it's headed out to our regional branch in Poughkeepsie.",176,8187
8187,2,11,Marshall ,"What?No, no, no, no,I need that package today.",177,8188
8188,2,11,Women ,"Listen, the truck already left five minutes ago so unless you want to run after it...",178,8189
8189,2,11,Marshall ,"Stop! Stop! Stop, please, stop. Stop. Stop the truck. I need a package on your truck. Can I please take a look in back?",179,8190
8190,2,11,Truck driver, Sure. But I gotta keep driving my route. I'm running behind.,180,8191
8191,2,11,Truck driver, My bad.,181,8192
8192,2,11,Marshall ,"I'm okay. (out of the truck) Hey, man, thanks for helping me make my fiancee's Christmas.",182,8193
8193,2,11,Truck driver, No problem. Too bad I can't deliver all these packages by the end of the day.,183,8194
8194,2,11,Marshall ,"Wait, so some people aren't going to get their gifts in time for Christmas?",184,8195
8195,2,11,Truck driver," Sadly, no.",185,8196
8196,2,11,Marshall ,"We delivered every single package on that truck. But I still have one package left to give. Yeah, I did. Merry Christmas. Open it, Baby.",186,8197
8197,2,11,Lily ,"Okay. Oh, my God. An Easy Bake Oven! I've wanted one of these ever since I was a little girl. In this exact model. I never told you that. How did you know?",187,8198
8198,2,11,Marshall ,It's our first Christmas since we got back together. I want to get her something really special. So I'm getting her a jukebox.,188,8199
8199,2,11,Ted ,"Wow, that's a great gift.",189,8200
8200,2,11,Marshall ,Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum.,190,8201
8201,2,11,Ted ,"Oh, man, I know something you could get her that would blow her mind. Ready? Eight years ago...",191,8202
8202,2,11,Lily ,"When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven. I begged and I begged, but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles.",192,8203
8203,2,11,Ted ,Easy Bake Oven--that's what I'm going to call my van.,193,8204
8204,2,11,Ted ,Dude... how was the concert?,194,8205
8205,2,11,Marshall ,I couldn't find the outside.,195,8206
8206,2,11,Lily ,I can't believe Ted remembered after all these years.,196,8207
8207,2,11,Marshall ,"Yeah, and after all that weed. Where is he anyway?",197,8208
8208,2,11,Lily ,Staten Island.,198,8209
8209,2,11,Marshall ,Why?,199,8210
8210,2,11,Ted ,"Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents.",200,8211
8211,2,11,A kid, Like the gift of God's love?,201,8212
8212,2,11,Ted ,"No, dude, real presents.",202,8213
8213,2,11,Kid ,Uncle Ted got us presents!,203,8214
8214,2,11,Stacy ,"That's okay, Ted, we'll just give them to charity.",204,8215
8215,2,11,Charity ,Yay!,205,8216
8216,2,11,Stacy ,"Uh, not you, Charity. I meant the less fortunate. Ted, how would you like to say grace tonight?",206,8217
8217,2,11,Ted ,"Uh, you know what, why don't you say it. I really wouldn't know what to say.",207,8218
8218,2,11,Charity ,Why don't you recite your favorite passage of scripture.,208,8219
8219,2,11,Ted ,"That's a great idea, Charity. But, really, I don't know. I mean how do you choose your favorite passage? It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones... That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool. Doorbell rings. Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in.",209,8220
8220,2,11,Charity ,"Dear, Father, thank you for this day, and thank you for bringing this family together. Amen.",210,8221
8221,2,11,Stacy ,"Who is it, Ted?",211,8222
8222,2,11,Ted ,"Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers. Marshall starts singing. Robin and Barney follow.",212,8223
8223,2,11,Lily ,"I came here to apologize. I'm so sorry, Ted.",213,8224
8224,2,11,Ted ,I accept. Give me the beer. it is so good to see you guys.,214,8225
8225,2,11,Lily ,Are you coming home?,215,8226
8226,2,11,Ted ,"Totally. But first, Lily, I owe you an apology.",216,8227
8227,2,11,Lily ,"Oh, for the love of God, are you as sick of apologies as I am?",217,8228
8228,2,11,Ted ,Yes,218,8229
8229,2,11,Lily ,Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving?,219,8230
8230,2,11,Ted ,"Yes. And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again.",220,8231
8231,2,11,Lily ,That's okay. I was kind of a Grinch.,221,8232
8232,2,11,Ted ,Nothing. It's something you shouldn't say.,222,8233
8233,2,11,Kid ,"Mom, what's a Grinch?",223,8234
8234,2,11,Both kids," Grinch, Grinch, Grinch...",224,8235
8235,2,11,Ted ( to the family) ,"Merry Christmas, everybody. Ted takes his coat and leaves (to his friends) Run, run.",225,8236
8236,2,11,Marshall ,"Merry Christmas, Marshall.",226,8237
8237,2,12,,"Ted (V.O.): Kids, you remember my first day with Robin.",1,8238
8238,2,12,Ted ,I think I'm in love with you.,2,8239
8239,2,12,Robin ,What?!,3,8240
8240,2,12,Ted (voix off) ,"Well, here's the thing, normal people, you know, people who aren't your dad, usually take longer to say ""I love you."" Robin went through the usual stages.",4,8241
8241,2,12,Robin ,Spider! Spider!,5,8242
8242,2,12,Barney ,I left something in the hallway.,6,8243
8243,2,12,Ted ,Where?,7,8244
8244,2,12,Robin ,Right there.,8,8245
8245,2,12,Ted ,Got it.,9,8246
8246,2,12,Ted (voix off) ,First there's the moment when you think you think it.,10,8247
8247,2,12,Ted ,"Whoa, still alive.",11,8248
8248,2,12,Ted (voix off) ,There's the moment you think you know it.,12,8249
8249,2,12,,Robin is sick and in bed: ,13,8250
8250,2,12,Robin ,"Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick.",14,8251
8251,2,12,Ted ,Totally worth it.,15,8252
8252,2,12,Ted (voix off) ,"There's the moment where you know you know it, but you can't yet say it.",16,8253
8253,2,12,Ted ,"All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow?",17,8254
8254,2,12,Robin ,Good night.,18,8255
8255,2,12,Ted ,Good night.,19,8256
8256,2,12,Robin ,"Wait, Ted?",20,8257
8257,2,12,Ted ,Yeah?,21,8258
8258,2,12,Robin ,Good night.,22,8259
8259,2,12,Robin ,"Well, great, I'll see you then. Bye, sweetie. (To Ted) Hey. Guess what? My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend. She gets in on Thursday.",23,8260
8260,2,12,Ted ,That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.,24,8261
8261,2,12,Robin ,Really? You'd do that?,25,8262
8262,2,12,Ted ,Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building.,26,8263
8263,2,12,Ted (voix off) ,"And then there's the moment where you know you know it, and you can't keep it in any longer.",27,8264
8264,2,12,Robin ,Ted.,28,8265
8265,2,12,Ted ,Yeah?,29,8266
8266,2,12,Robin ,Falafel.,30,8267
8267,2,12,Lily ,Falafel?,31,8268
8268,2,12,Robin ,Falafel.,32,8269
8269,2,12,Lily ,"Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said ""falafel""?",33,8270
8270,2,12,Robin ,I totally choked.,34,8271
8271,2,12,Lily ,I just don't get it. Why can't you tell Ted you love him?,35,8272
8272,2,12,Robin ,"Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.",36,8273
8273,2,12,Lily ,"Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before. No.",37,8274
8274,2,12,Robin ,"Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit.",38,8275
8275,2,12,Lily ,Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.,39,8276
8276,2,12,Barney ,"Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway.",40,8277
8277,2,12,Marshall ,"Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus.",41,8278
8278,2,12,Barney ,"No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have s*x, you exit when she's in the shower.",42,8279
8279,2,12,Robin ,"So every girl you have s*x with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that.",43,8280
8280,2,12,Barney ,"The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars.",44,8281
8281,2,12,Ted ,What?,45,8282
8282,2,12,Barney ,"Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, ""Are we there yet?""",46,8283
8283,2,12,Robin ,"So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit.",47,8284
8284,2,12,Lily ,"Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall.",48,8285
8285,2,12,Robin ,It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.,49,8286
8286,2,12,Lily ,"Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing.",50,8287
8287,2,12,Robin ,"Oh, here comes Katie.",51,8288
8288,2,12,Lily ,"Aw, your sister's so cute.",52,8289
8289,2,12,Robin ,"Yeah. This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school, with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack.",53,8290
8290,2,12,Lily ,"Hello, Kitty.",54,8291
8291,2,12,Robin ,"Oh, no. No. No. No.",55,8292
8292,2,12,Katie ,"Hey, Robin. How are you?",56,8293
8293,2,12,Robin ,"Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person?",57,8294
8294,2,12,Katie ,"Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle.",58,8295
8295,2,12,Kyle ,Looks like hotness runs in the family.,59,8296
8296,2,12,Robin ,"Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...?",60,8297
8297,2,12,Katie ,Two whole months.,61,8298
8298,2,12,Kyle ,Yeah.,62,8299
8299,2,12,Katie ,"He's actually coming to visit family in New York, too. Isn't that great?",63,8300
8300,2,12,Kyle ,"My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad, but he buys me beer, so...",64,8301
8301,2,12,Robin ,That's cool. This is my friend Lily.,65,8302
8302,2,12,Kyle ,Hot.,66,8303
8303,2,12,Robin ,"You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled.",67,8304
8304,2,12,Katie ,"Um, actually, I'm going to stay with Kyle tonight.",68,8305
8305,2,12,Robin ,"Uh, no, you're not.",69,8306
8306,2,12,Katie ,"Oh, come on. It's kind of a special night. If you know what I mean.",70,8307
8307,2,12,Robin ,What? Oh. Oh...,71,8308
8308,2,12,Robin , I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a......douche with a faux hawk. This can't happen. You guys have to help me talk her out of it.,72,8309
8309,2,12,Marshall ,Speech to talk a girl out of having s*x.,73,8310
8310,2,12,Ted ,"Yeah, I don't have any of those.",74,8311
8311,2,12,Barney ,Discouraging premarital s*x is against my religion.,75,8312
8312,2,12,Robin ,Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.,76,8313
8313,2,12,Lily ,It's 2:00 and you've already had three scotch and sodas.,77,8314
8314,2,12,Robin ,That's why I need your help.,78,8315
8315,2,12,Ted (voix off) ,"Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night. And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building.",79,8316
8316,2,12,Ted ,You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun,80,8317
8317,2,12,fact number one," When construction began on March 17, 1930, the framework rose at a rate of four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. There it is. There it is. Come on. These are fun facts, guys, let's have fun with them.",81,8318
8318,2,12,Robin ,"You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special.",82,8319
8319,2,12,Katie ,"Oh, here we go.",83,8320
8320,2,12,Lily ,Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either. But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancee.,84,8321
8321,2,12,Marshall ,"Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school. It's totally cool to wait. And stay away from drugs... other than pot.",85,8322
8322,2,12,Katie ,You told them?,86,8323
8323,2,12,Robin ,"Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?",87,8324
8324,2,12,All ,Totally. You should wait.,88,8325
8325,2,12,Barney ,s*x is fun.,89,8326
8326,2,12,Robin ,See?,90,8327
8327,2,12,Katie ,You are such a hypocrite. You were only 16 when you lost yours.,91,8328
8328,2,12,Robin ,"Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room.",92,8329
8329,2,12,Barney ,"I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.",93,8330
8330,2,12,Katie ,"Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now. It's like forever. I mean, we've already done everything else. I mean, we've even...",94,8331
8331,2,12,Robin ,"Oh. La, la, la, la, la.La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la, la, la, la.",95,8332
8332,2,12,Marshall ,Even Kyle gets to do that.,96,8333
8333,2,12,Katie ,You have no right to tell me not to do it.,97,8334
8334,2,12,Robin ,"But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted.",98,8335
8335,2,12,Katie ,"Robin, this is happening. Look, I already put it up on my Myspace page. I need a clove.",99,8336
8336,2,12,Robin ,"You smoke now, too?",100,8337
8337,2,12,Lily ,"Oh, remember cloves?",101,8338
8338,2,12,Marshall ,No!,102,8339
8339,2,12,Robin ,"No ""Aw, remember cloves?"" This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having s*x.",103,8340
8340,2,12,Ted ,"Come on, you were only 16 when you had s*x. I was 17.",104,8341
8341,2,12,Marshall ,We were 18.,105,8342
8342,2,12,Ted ,Barney was probably 12.,106,8343
8343,2,12,Barney ,"Good one, Ted. I was, uh, six... fourt... How old were you again?",107,8344
8344,2,12,Ted ,17.,108,8345
8345,2,12,Barney ,"Dude, me, too.",109,8346
8346,2,12,Lily ,"Barney, you okay?",110,8347
8347,2,12,Barney ,"Yeah, of course. What, you don't believe me? - It was at camp, so I'm...",111,8348
8348,2,12,Marshall ,What camp?,112,8349
8349,2,12,Barney ,This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer.,113,8350
8350,2,12,Robin ,What did you teach?,114,8351
8351,2,12,Barney ,"Uh, dance.",115,8352
8352,2,12,Ted ,Dance?,116,8353
8353,2,12,Barney ,"Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.",117,8354
8354,2,12,Barney ,Sylvia,118,8355
8355,2,12,Sylvia ,"Yes, Mickey?",119,8356
8356,2,12,Barney ,How you call your loverboy?,120,8357
8357,2,12,Sylvia ,"Come here, loverboy",121,8358
8358,2,12,Barney ,And if he doesn't answer,122,8359
8359,2,12,Sylvia ,"Oh, loverboy",123,8360
8360,2,12,Barney ,And if he still doesn't answer?,124,8361
8361,2,12,Sylvia ,"I simply say, baby... Oh, baby. My sweet baby",125,8362
8362,2,12,Lily ,That's Dirty Dancing.,126,8363
8363,2,12,Ted ,It was on last night.,127,8364
8364,2,12,Marshall ,"No, it was two nights ago. ""She's Like the Wind"" has been stuck in my brain for about 40 hours. I just got it out. Now it's back in. Damn you, Swayze!",128,8365
8365,2,12,Lily ,Do you remember our first time?,129,8366
8366,2,12,Marshall ,Yeah. It was back in college.,130,8367
8367,2,12,Lily ,"Oh, wait, wait. Look... I really want to do this, but... we should make it special, you know? Do this right.",131,8368
8368,2,12,Marshall ,Okay. You're right. Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend.,132,8369
8369,2,12,Lily ,"Yeah, New Year's Eve.",133,8370
8370,2,12,Marshall ,Okay.,134,8371
8371,2,12,Lily ,"Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music.",135,8372
8372,2,12,Marshall ,That's not a good idea.,136,8373
8373,2,12,Lily ,Why not?,137,8374
8374,2,12,Marshall ,Long story. But maybe we could put on some Al Green and take a bubble bath together.,138,8375
8375,2,12,Lily ,"Oh, yeah, that sounds so good. Oh, I love you, Marshall. I'm so glad we're waiting. (12 minutes later): Oops. End of flashback.",139,8376
8376,2,12,Robin ,"Oh, that's adorable.",140,8377
8377,2,12,Ted ,"Yeah, tell her what happened next.",141,8378
8378,2,12,Marshall ,That was amazing.,142,8379
8379,2,12,Lily ,Yeah. Want to do it again?,143,8380
8380,2,12,Ted (on the bed of the top) ,Please don't. End of flashback.,144,8381
8381,2,12,Marshall ,We said we were sorry.,145,8382
8382,2,12,Ted ,"Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?",146,8383
8383,2,12,Marshall ,"You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.",147,8384
8384,2,12,Lily ,"The point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.",148,8385
8385,2,12,Robin ,"Well, mine was terrible.",149,8386
8386,2,12,Lily ,"Wait, I've never heard your story.",150,8387
8387,2,12,Robin ,"Well, as you know, I was 16. And it was with my boyfriend Brian.",151,8388
8388,2,12,Brian ,Ready?,152,8389
8389,2,12,Robin ,Yeah.,153,8390
8390,2,12,Brian ,This feels so right.,154,8391
8391,2,12,Robin ,"Oh, I know.",155,8392
8392,2,12,Brian ,"Oh, Robin.",156,8393
8393,2,12,Robin ,"Oh, Brian.",157,8394
8394,2,12,Brian ,"Yeah, I'm gay. End of flashback.",158,8395
8395,2,12,Lily ,I'm so sorry.,159,8396
8396,2,12,Robin ,"Eh, I should've known. There were signs.",160,8397
8397,2,12,Brian ,"Oh, my God! My mom's home. Quick! Get under my bed.",161,8398
8398,2,12,Robin ,"What?! Oh, my God!",162,8399
8399,2,12,Robin ,"You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had s*x, it counts.",163,8400
8400,2,12,Lily ,What do you mean just barely?,164,8401
8401,2,12,Robin ,"Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end.",165,8402
8402,2,12,Lily , Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count.,166,8403
8403,2,12,Robin ,"Yes, it does.",167,8404
8404,2,12,Lily ,"No, it doesn't.",168,8405
8405,2,12,Marshall ,"Yes, it does.",169,8406
8406,2,12,Lily ,"No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story.",170,8407
8407,2,12,Barney ,"Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot. Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water?",171,8408
8408,2,12,Marshall ,"No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter?",172,8409
8409,2,12,Barney ,Who's Scooter?,173,8410
8410,2,12,Lily ,"My high school boyfriend, who I did not have s*x with.",174,8411
8411,2,12,Marshall ,"I... I can't believe this. We're Marshall and Lily, when people see us, they say, ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other.""",175,8412
8412,2,12,Barney ,"No, Marshall, they say, (with a sad voice) ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other.""",176,8413
8413,2,12,Marshall ,"But now that's not true anymore, now you've had s*x with twice as many people as I have. I knew that you were too good at it.",177,8414
8414,2,12,Katie ,Know what? I don't want to see the stupid Empire State Building anymore.,178,8415
8415,2,12,Ted ,It's not stupid.,179,8416
8416,2,12,Katie ,I'm going to see Kyle.,180,8417
8417,2,12,Robin ,"Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once. You should only be having s*x with someone who's special.",181,8418
8418,2,12,Katie ,"Oh, please, you've had s*x with, like, a hundred guys.",182,8419
8419,2,12,Robin ,It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys.,183,8420
8420,2,12,Katie ,I'm sure you were madly in love with all of them.,184,8421
8421,2,12,Robin ,I had different levels of feeling for each of the... very reasonable number of guys.,185,8422
8422,2,12,Katie ,"Really. Well, do you love Ted? Do you love Ted?",186,8423
8423,2,12,Robin ,"I, um...",187,8424
8424,2,12,Ted ,"Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 22: The Empire State Building has tons of places where people can have private conversations. ( goes away with Robin) You're off the hook, okay?",188,8425
8425,2,12,Robin ,Just let me explain.,189,8426
8426,2,12,Ted ,You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine.,190,8427
8427,2,12,Robin ,"Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying... ""hm hm hm"" is like... getting into the carpool lane. And I don't want to take an exit, but... at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane. Because what's in the carpool lane? Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get...",191,8428
8428,2,12,Ted ,"Okay, Robin, Robin, stop. It's no big deal, you don't have to say it.",192,8429
8429,2,12,Robin ,"It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.",193,8430
8430,2,12,Ted ,"What, you mean like I did?",194,8431
8431,2,12,Robin ,"No. I didn't... Yeah, like you did. I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird.",195,8432
8432,2,12,Ted ,Weird... or courageous?,196,8433
8433,2,12,Robin ,"Pretty sure weird. I mean, who gives it up on the first date?",197,8434
8434,2,12,Ted ,"Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight.",198,8435
8435,2,12,Robin ,"No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut.",199,8436
8436,2,12,Ted ,"Well, then you're an I-love-you prude. You know what? I take mine back.",200,8437
8437,2,12,Robin ,You... What?,201,8438
8438,2,12,Ted ,"I take my ""I love you"" back.",202,8439
8439,2,12,Robin ,You can't take it back.,203,8440
8440,2,12,Ted ,"Nah. Just did. Got it right here. But, you know, I'm such a slut. I'm just gonna give it away. Hey, you, sir. I love you.",204,8441
8441,2,12,Man ,"Thank you, man. I was going up there to jump. (the man hugs Ted)",205,8442
8442,2,12,Lily ,"Marshall, why is this such a big deal?",206,8443
8443,2,12,Marshall ,"Why is this such a big deal? Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus, guess who actually discovered the New World. Some dude named Scooter. Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong, it actually goes like this: ""One small step for man, one giant leap for Scooter."" Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve before you did...",207,8444
8444,2,12,Lily ,"Okay, Marshall, I get it.",208,8445
8445,2,12,Marshall ,It's a big deal because it rewrites our history.,209,8446
8446,2,12,Lily ,"No, it doesn't. Look, have you been to the Empire State Building? No. You've only been in the lobby. People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby. They buy tickets to get to the top. Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count.",210,8447
8447,2,12,Marshall ,"Really. Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building?",211,8448
8448,2,12,Marshall ,"Thank you, sir. You're a very wise and brilliant man.",212,8449
8449,2,12,Man ,You're right. Why would I throw that all away? I'm having the best day!,213,8450
8450,2,12,Robin ,"Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place to lecture you on romantic relationships, but... but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made.",214,8451
8451,2,12,Katie ,"Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay.",215,8452
8452,2,12,Robin ,That's not what I meant. I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up. Please don't do this.,216,8453
8453,2,12,,"Ted (V.O.) : But, kids, later that night, Katie did it, and she got pregnant... with quintuplets... and she lived out her days in a trailer park... where she died an alcoholic. So the moral here, kids, don't have s*x until you're married. Maybe even, like, a year or two into marriage.",217,8454
8454,2,12,His kids, Dad!,218,8455
8455,2,12,The girl," Come on, what really happened?",219,8456
8456,2,12,,"Ted (V.O.): All right, here's what really happened.",220,8457
8457,2,12,Robin ,Hey.,221,8458
8458,2,12,Ted ,Hey.,222,8459
8459,2,12,Robin ,She didn't do it.,223,8460
8460,2,12,Ted ,"Hey, that's great! You got through to her.",224,8461
8461,2,12,Robin ,"No, I didn't. You did. She told me that you talked to her.",225,8462
8462,2,12,Ted ,"Hey, Katie.",226,8463
8463,2,12,Katie ,Hey. Got another Empire State Building fun fact for me?,227,8464
8464,2,12,Ted ,"No. I wouldn't bore you with the seven million man-hours it took to build this 102-story testament to human will. So, you okay?",228,8465
8465,2,12,Katie ,"I don't know what everyone is freaking out about. Kyle, he's a really nice guy. He could've cheated on me with my lab partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't. 'Cause he said he knew I'd find out.",229,8466
8466,2,12,Ted ,"That's very gallant. Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either. - I was your age my first time.",230,8467
8467,2,12,Katie ,"Oh, really?",231,8468
8468,2,12,Ted ,"Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, it was with this girl, Molly.",232,8469
8469,2,12,Molly ,"I love you, Ted.",233,8470
8470,2,12,Ted ,"Oh, I love you, too, Molly. (Voix off ) But I didn't.",234,8471
8471,2,12,Molly ,That was amazing.,235,8472
8472,2,12,Ted ,"Look, I got to go.",236,8473
8473,2,12,Molly ,Where are you going?,237,8474
8474,2,12,Ted ,My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome.,238,8475
8475,2,12,Molly ,"Well, will you call me?",239,8476
8476,2,12,Ted ,"Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you. (Voix off) But I didn't. Molly?",240,8477
8477,2,12,Molly ,Yeah?,241,8478
8478,2,12,Ted ,Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.(Voix off) But I didn't.,242,8479
8479,2,12,Ted ,"And I never saw her again. I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have s*x. I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and... that's exactly what I did. Look, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like. Even the nice ones.",243,8480
8480,2,12,Katie ,So I told Kyle I wanted to wait... and he dumped me.,244,8481
8481,2,12,Robin ,"Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Aw, honey. I promise everything is gonna be okay. You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo?",245,8482
8482,2,12,Katie ,Only if you put a buttload of Kahlua in it.,246,8483
8483,2,12,Robin ,Don't tell Mom.,247,8484
8484,2,12,Robin ,Thanks for doing that.,248,8485
8485,2,12,Ted ,You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you.,249,8486
8486,2,12,Robin ,"But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you.",250,8487
8487,2,12,Ted ,"Yeah, well...",251,8488
8488,2,12,Ted ,"I love you, Molly.",252,8489
8489,2,12,Molly ,"Oh, I love you, too, Ted.",253,8490
8490,2,12,Ted ,Wow. That was amazing.,254,8491
8491,2,12,Molly ," Look, I got to go.",255,8492
8492,2,12,Ted ,Wh-Where are you going?,256,8493
8493,2,12,Molly ,"Uh, my cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going into the woods to light them. It's gonna be awesome.",257,8494
8494,2,12,Ted ,Will you call me?,258,8495
8495,2,12,Molly ,"Yeah. I'll totally call you. Oh, Ted?",259,8496
8496,2,12,Ted ,Yeah?,260,8497
8497,2,12,Molly ,Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.,261,8498
8498,2,12,Ted ,But she didn't.,262,8499
8499,2,12,Robin ,"Oh, come here. I love you. I said it. Feels right. I love you.",263,8500
8500,2,12,Ted ,"I'm gay. I'm kidding. I love you, too. Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity.",264,8501
8501,2,12,Robin ,Yeah. I guess I was just waiting for the right guy.,265,8502
8502,2,12,Ted (voix off) ,Katie ended up having a great first time in New York. And the last thing we did before she left was go to the Empire State Building.,266,8503
8503,2,12,Ted ,I am so glad we're finally doing this.,267,8504
8504,2,12,Barney ,What are you talking about? We were here yesterday.,268,8505
8505,2,12,Marshall ,"Yeah, but that didn't really count. Oh, crap.",269,8506
8506,2,12,Lily ,"Exactly! So yesterday doesn't count as having gone to the Empire State Building. So I lost it to you, Marshall. And I rode that elevator to the top, and I saw that view, and I basked in the awesomeness. And that's our story.",270,8507
8507,2,12,Marshall ,"Yeah. Yeah, that's our story. We've only had s*x with each other.",271,8508
8508,2,12,Lily ,We've only had s*x with each other.,272,8509
8509,2,12,Barney ,They've only had s*x with each other.,273,8510
8510,2,12,Ted ,"Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go. Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 81: There are 1,860 steps from this... (They push him outside the elevator) Whoa, whoa! Come on!",274,8511
8511,2,12,Ted ,"So, now you guys can finally say you've been to the Empire State Building. How have you lived here so long and never been to the top?",275,8512
8512,2,12,Marshall ,"Well, we're usually busy... drinking.",276,8513
8513,2,12,Lily ,"Speaking of first times, we never got to hear your virginity story.",277,8514
8514,2,12,Marshall ,"That's right, I almost forgot.",278,8515
8515,2,12,Barney ,"Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout...",279,8516
8516,2,12,Marshall ,Fast Times at Ridgemont High.,280,8517
8517,2,12,Barney ,"I mean, I was in a subway with a high-priced call girl...",281,8518
8518,2,12,Ted ,Risky Business.,282,8519
8519,2,12,Barney ,I was accidentally hacking into NORAD'S computer...,283,8520
8520,2,12,Ted ,"That's War Games, and there's not even a s*x scene in it.",284,8521
8521,2,12,Barney ,"All right! I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda. She called me ""Barry"" the whole time, and for two weeks, my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy?",285,8522
8522,2,12,Marshall ,Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills.,286,8523
8523,2,12,Barney ,Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's. Her dad did not approve of our love.,287,8524
8524,2,12,Ted ,Did anyone put Baby in a corner?,288,8525
8525,2,12,Barney ,"Oh, God, no. What can I say, I... had... the time of my life. True story.",289,8526
8526,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,"Some kids dream of being astronauts. Some kids dream of playing baseball. When I was a kid, I had only one dream. To build a skyscraper.",1,8527
8527,2,13,Boy ,That's stupid. (he destroys Ted's tower.),2,8528
8528,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,There were some obstacles along the way. But eventually my dream came true. I became an architect.,3,8529
8529,2,13,Ted ,"Morning, everyone! So, I had an idea for the atrium. Ready? Columns.",4,8530
8530,2,13,,Mr. Druthers: That's stupid. (he destroys his model),5,8531
8531,2,13,Ted ,I... I can't believe you knocked over my model.,6,8532
8532,2,13,Mr Druthers," Well, it's just... it's not exactly new, is it-- columns? I mean, what's your next groundbreaking idea-- ceilings? Floors? Windows?",7,8533
8533,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,"I know what you're thinking: Who's this jerk? Well, this jerk was Hammond Druthers, a legend in the architecture community. Very big in the '80s. He was also far and away the worst boss I ever had. Then I designed the Spokane National Bank Building. And suddenly... I was his boss. - And he didn't like it.",8,8534
8534,2,13,Mr Druthers, Stairs?,9,8535
8535,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,"And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either. See, before, when I was just another employee, I was happy, carefree. The guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss.",10,8536
8536,2,13,Ted ,Did you see what he was wearing today? It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples.,11,8537
8537,2,13,Co-worker," Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers, I get hay fever just looking at it.",12,8538
8538,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,But suddenly I was a different guy.,13,8539
8539,2,13,Ted ,"Hey, guys. What's so funny?",14,8540
8540,2,13,Co-worker, Nothing. Um... nice shirt.,15,8541
8541,2,13,Ted ,Thanks.,16,8542
8542,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,The hours were insane. I was always working even when I wasn't at work.,17,8543
8543,2,13,Ted ,"Oh, Robin... I just had a great idea.",18,8544
8544,2,13,Robin ,"Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up.",19,8545
8545,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,"Before, I used to be this guy.",20,8546
8546,2,13,Ted ,"Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert. Just say you're sick.",21,8547
8547,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,But now...I was this guy.,22,8548
8548,2,13,Ted ,"Sick, huh? Unbutton your shirt. Hmm... ""Foo Fighters."" Get back to work.",23,8549
8549,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,"But still, the worst part was Druthers.",24,8550
8550,2,13,Ted ,"Well, I was thinking...",25,8551
8551,2,13,Mr Druthers," Ceilings? Oops. Said that already. Then again, you seem to like rehashing old ideas. I'm kidding, of course. Another hole in one, boss.",26,8552
8552,2,13,Robin ,"Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking.",27,8553
8553,2,13,Ted ,Why would you say that?,28,8554
8554,2,13,Robin ,"Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that.",29,8555
8555,2,13,Barney ,I have found that to be true.,30,8556
8556,2,13,Marshall ,It's a blessing and a curse really.,31,8557
8557,2,13,Lily ,"Ted, you can't let him treat you like that.",32,8558
8558,2,13,Marshall ,"Yeah, you gotta ask yourself, who's the boss?",33,8559
8559,2,13,Ted ,Tony.,34,8560
8560,2,13,Robin ,Angela.,35,8561
8561,2,13,Barney ,Mona.,36,8562
8562,2,13,Robin ,Mona?,37,8563
8563,2,13,Barney ,Watch it more closely. Rock your world.,38,8564
8564,2,13,Robin ,"So, what are you gonna do?",39,8565
8565,2,13,Ted ,"Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss. So, I went to talk to the managing partner.",40,8566
8566,2,13,MP ,Fire him.,41,8567
8567,2,13,Ted ,"Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project.",42,8568
8568,2,13,MP ,"Fire him! He's an arrogant, washed-up, pain in the ass. In fact, fire everyone on that project. Druthers, Mosby, the whole lot of them.",43,8569
8569,2,13,Ted ,"Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear Mosby's doing some great work.",44,8570
8570,2,13,MP ,"Fine, Mosby can stay. But tell him he's on thin ice. Come here. I like you, Crosby.",45,8571
8571,2,13,Barney ,You mind if I charge my phone?,46,8572
8572,2,13,Ted ,Knock yourself out.,47,8573
8573,2,13,Robin ,"Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing. Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?",48,8574
8574,2,13,Robin ,"Vicki, um... I'm so sorry about this, but there's been some budget cuts and, um, we have to let you go. I mean, after tonight. I still need my makeup for the broadcast. So... (Robin on TV wearing a lot of make-up.): Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims.",49,8575
8575,2,13,Ted ,You know what? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fire Druthers tomorrow.,50,8576
8576,2,13,Barney ,"Oh, my God! (barney's holding a painting)",51,8577
8577,2,13,Ted ,What?,52,8578
8578,2,13,Barney ,Do you know about this?,53,8579
8579,2,13,Ted ,No.,54,8580
8580,2,13,Robin ,What is that?,55,8581
8581,2,13,Barney ,"Only the greatest thing ever. Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup. If they were to cure cancer tomorrow, this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week. Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall.",56,8582
8582,2,13,Ted ,"Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared.",57,8583
8583,2,13,Barney ,"I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time.",58,8584
8584,2,13,Robin ,"Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it.",59,8585
8585,2,13,Barney ,"Oh, come on, Robin.",60,8586
8586,2,13,Robin ,"No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun.",61,8587
8587,2,13,Barney ,I know! We're gonna have so much fun!,62,8588
8588,2,13,Mr Druthers," Oh, sorry I'm late; lunch ran a little long. You wanted to see me, Mosby?",63,8589
8589,2,13,Ted ,"Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.",64,8590
8590,2,13,Mr Druthers," Well, excuse me, for spending the last four hours drawing designs for your building.",65,8591
8591,2,13,Ted ,"This is a cocktail napkin. Covered in profanity. Look, Hammond, um, there's no easy way to say this, so... why don't we just, um, step into your office.",66,8592
8592,2,13,Employees ,Happy birthday to you.,67,8593
8593,2,13,Mr Druthers," Oh, you had me. You so had me.",68,8594
8594,2,13,Robin ,"So, you didn't fire him?",69,8595
8595,2,13,Ted ,"I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised.",70,8596
8596,2,13,Barney ,"Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat. I know how much you love stools.",71,8597
8597,2,13,Marshall ,"Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture.",72,8598
8598,2,13,Robin ,"And, uh... I... got you a rose.",73,8599
8599,2,13,Marshall ,Thank you. That's so sweet. You guys are being... so sweet.,74,8600
8600,2,13,Barney ,"Hey, guys. Guess what I got. A new dart.",75,8601
8601,2,13,Robin ,"Oh, wow, a new dart.",76,8602
8602,2,13,Ted ,"Hey, that new dart is great.",77,8603
8603,2,13,Robin ,"I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney.",78,8604
8604,2,13,Barney ,"Oh, yes, Robin, I just love new dart. Nude art.",79,8605
8605,2,13,Ted , Nude art.,80,8606
8606,2,13,Robin , Nude art.,81,8607
8607,2,13,Marshall ,"Okay, all right, so what, you guys found the painting, huh?",82,8608
8608,2,13,Lily ,I knew this day would come.,83,8609
8609,2,13,Marshall ,How did you know that?,84,8610
8610,2,13,Lily ,Because I didn't hide it very well.,85,8611
8611,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,"So the story on the painting is that,back in college, Lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class. Marshall wasn't so into the idea.",86,8612
8612,2,13,Marshall ,"Well, I just... don't think that some dude should drop trou just to pose for you.",87,8613
8613,2,13,Lily ,"It's for class, and it's just that weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.",88,8614
8614,2,13,Marshall ,The frisbee dude with the soul patch? He's like the hottest guy in school!,89,8615
8615,2,13,Lily ,"No, he's actually a little husky...",90,8616
8616,2,13,Marshall ,"Oh, he's just huggable! And complicated... and a little bit of a jerk. Just enough so you think maybe you can change him.",91,8617
8617,2,13,Lily ,"Okay, just forget it.",92,8618
8618,2,13,Marshall ,"Call me old-fashioned, I just think that I'm the only guy you should see naked.",93,8619
8619,2,13,Lily ,"Well, then you'll have to do it.",94,8620
8620,2,13,Marshall ,Are you kidding me? What if somebody sees it?,95,8621
8621,2,13,Lily ,We're not in high school anymore. People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting. We're adults now.,96,8622
8622,2,13,Barney ,We totally saw your butt.,97,8623
8623,2,13,Marshall ,This painting has caused too much grief already. I'm destroying it right now.,98,8624
8624,2,13,Barney ,"Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall?",99,8625
8625,2,13,Marshall ,Where is it?,100,8626
8626,2,13,Barney ,I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three.,101,8627
8627,2,13,Marshall ,"You hung it up in the bar, didn't you?",102,8628
8628,2,13,Barney ,"Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles?",103,8629
8629,2,13,Ted ,Field trip!,104,8630
8630,2,13,Barney ,"Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar. Classic! What a memorable prank.",105,8631
8631,2,13,Carl ,"Hey, Marshall. What'll you have?",106,8632
8632,2,13,Marshall ,"What'll I have? Um, I don't know, maybe a beer and that nude painting of me hanging behind the bar!",107,8633
8633,2,13,Carl ,"Ooh, I'm sorry, that painting's property of the bar.",108,8634
8634,2,13,Marshall ,I know that Barney gave you that painting.,109,8635
8635,2,13,Carl ,I don't know what you're talking about.,110,8636
8636,2,13,Marshall ,"Whatever he's paying you, I'll pay you double.",111,8637
8637,2,13,Carl ,I doubt it.,112,8638
8638,2,13,Marshall ,"Whatever he's paying you, I'll give you that plus ten bucks.",113,8639
8639,2,13,Carl ,I doubt it.,114,8640
8640,2,13,Marshall ,"All right, you know what, Carl, you just lost yourself a regular customer.",115,8641
8641,2,13,Carl ,I doubt it.,116,8642
8642,2,13,Marshall ,This painting is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.,117,8643
8643,2,13,Robin ,"Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost?",118,8644
8644,2,13,Barney ,"Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse. I've got a five-year rollout plan. I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city. Then, after New York...",119,8645
8645,2,13,Ted ,"One of my worst fears has come true-- I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked. Well, I gotta go. Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office.",120,8646
8646,2,13,Robin ,"Oh, I'll go out with you. Bye, guys.",121,8647
8647,2,13,Lily ,"You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting.",122,8648
8648,2,13,Barney ,"Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall. The painting's actually really great.",123,8649
8649,2,13,Lily ,Are you serious?,124,8650
8650,2,13,Barney ,Yeah.,125,8651
8651,2,13,Lily ,"Well, thank you. You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes. What?",126,8652
8652,2,13,Barney ,Paint me.,127,8653
8653,2,13,Lily ,What?,128,8654
8654,2,13,Barney ,Paint me.,129,8655
8655,2,13,Voice ,Who's that? Who's out there?,130,8656
8656,2,13,Ted ,"Hammond, is that you?",131,8657
8657,2,13,Mr Druthers, Mosby?,132,8658
8658,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,"Druthers and I were alone in the office. If I was gonna fire him, this would be the best chance I'd ever have.",133,8659
8659,2,13,Mr Druters," Uh, look, just a second, Ted.",134,8660
8660,2,13,Ted ,"Uh, no, I, I really need to talk to you. Look, there's no easy way to say... What, what are you doing?",135,8661
8661,2,13,Mr Druthers, What are you doing?,136,8662
8662,2,13,Ted ,I'm standing here wearing pants. Are you sleeping here? What's going on?,137,8663
8663,2,13,Mr Druthers," Okay, fine, yes. Not that it's any of your business but my wife had a little spat a few weeks ago, and I've been sleeping here until she cools off.",138,8664
8664,2,13,Ted ,"Okay, well, uh, you're right-- that is none of my business. Uh, look, there's no easy way to say this-- I...",139,8665
8665,2,13,Mr Druthers, Who am I kidding? She's never gonna take me back.,140,8666
8666,2,13,Ted ,It's okay.,141,8667
8667,2,13,Mr Druthers, What did you want to say to me?,142,8668
8668,2,13,Ted ,"Happy birthday, buddy. So, you've been living at the office?",143,8669
8669,2,13,Mr Druthers, Yes. I'm an architect without a home. You see the tragic irony in that?,144,8670
8670,2,13,Ted ,"Yeah, I do.",145,8671
8671,2,13,Mr Druthers, Cause I design homes.,146,8672
8672,2,13,Ted ,I see it.,147,8673
8673,2,13,Mr Druthers, But I don't have a home.,148,8674
8674,2,13,Ted ,"Not lost on me at all. But I don't understand, why don't you just go to a hotel? You could be sleeping on a mattress instead of... what appears to be torn-up drawings of my building.",149,8675
8675,2,13,Mr Druthers," Why would I go to a hotel, when any second, she's going to call and tell me to come home. She's a very special lady, Ted. She's quite... mannish. She gives me what I need. Do you understand that?",150,8676
8676,2,13,Ted ,"Uh, no, I don't.",151,8677
8677,2,13,Mr Druthers," If you were lost in the wilderness, she can provide for me.",152,8678
8678,2,13,Ted ,"Well, that's the dream.",153,8679
8679,2,13,Mr Druthers," I'm glad you came here tonight, Ted.",154,8680
8680,2,13,Ted ,"Me too, Hammond.",155,8681
8681,2,13,Mr Druthers, Call me Ham.,156,8682
8682,2,13,Ted ,"No, thanks.",157,8683
8683,2,13,Mr Druthers, Hammy D?,158,8684
8684,2,13,Ted ,"No, I think just Hammond.",159,8685
8685,2,13,Robin ,"So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him.",160,8686
8686,2,13,Ted ,I was this close.,161,8687
8687,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,"Meanwhile, Lily had been up all night in the grips of a dilemma.",162,8688
8688,2,13,Lily ,"Oh honey, you're awake?",163,8689
8689,2,13,Marshall ,I'm awake. Is everything okay?,164,8690
8690,2,13,Lily ,Yeah. I've kind of been wrestling with something. What if I told you I had a way to pay for our honeymoon?,165,8691
8691,2,13,Marshall ,"Baby, our honeymoon's already paid for. We're going to Howe Caverns.",166,8692
8692,2,13,Lily ,"Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?",167,8693
8693,2,13,Marshall ,"It's not just a cave, it's a whole labyrinth of caves. It's an underground adventure. There's a cave that's so dark that you don't even know you're in there. I mean, we're going to experience a whole new kind of dark.",168,8694
8694,2,13,Lily ,"Well, what if I found a way to make a little extra money so that we spend our honeymoon not in Howe Caverns, but in Scotland?",169,8695
8695,2,13,Marshall ,Loch Ness?,170,8696
8696,2,13,Lily ,"Yeah. And you know, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Glasgow...",171,8697
8697,2,13,Marshall ,"Loch Ness. Nessy. Baby, I would love to search for the enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch, but... we can't afford that.",172,8698
8698,2,13,Lily ,Maybe we can.,173,8699
8699,2,13,Barney ,Paint me.,174,8700
8700,2,13,Lily ,"Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you?",175,8701
8701,2,13,Barney ,"We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame. I do not. In my body, where the shame gland should be, there's a second awesome gland. True story.",176,8702
8702,2,13,Lily ,"Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting.",177,8703
8703,2,13,Barney ,"Yeah. A nude Barney is a challenge. But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this. Now is the time-- I'm 31. I'm at the peak of my physical beauty. If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago. Long ago.",178,8704
8704,2,13,Lily ,Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked.,179,8705
8705,2,13,Barney ,"I'll give you $5,000.",180,8706
8706,2,13,Marshall ,We're going to Loch Ness!,181,8707
8707,2,13,Lily ,Yeah!,182,8708
8708,2,13,Ted ,That cabby would not shut up.,183,8709
8709,2,13,Mr Druthers," Yeah, we should call him a gabby.",184,8710
8710,2,13,Ted ,"I think it, you say it.",185,8711
8711,2,13,Mr Druthers," Hey, uh... thanks for putting me up last night, buddy. Give 'em hell.",186,8712
8712,2,13,Ted ,"Morning, team. So, I have given it some thought, and I say we revisit columns.",187,8713
8713,2,13,Mr Druthers," Oh, God, not this again. Ted, a man in a toga just arrived and delivered a parchment. Let me read it: Oh! It's from ancient Greece. They want their basic architectural elements back. Geez.",188,8714
8714,2,13,Ted ,What?,189,8715
8715,2,13,Mr Druthers," You didn't hear me? Toga, parchment...",190,8716
8716,2,13,Ted ,Can I see you for one second?,191,8717
8717,2,13,Mr Druthers," Ooh, I'm in trouble now.",192,8718
8718,2,13,Ted ,"What are you doing? I thought we were friends. You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal. I tossed you more toilet paper.",193,8719
8719,2,13,Mr Druthers, We are friends. But that doesn't magically make your bad ideas good.,194,8720
8720,2,13,Ted ,"What? I don't believe this! You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes! And my",195,8721
8721,2,13,Mr Druthers," Ted, I hope that you're not going to let our professional woes interfere with our friendship, because I really kind of need you right now.",196,8722
8722,2,13,Lily ,"Okay, let's get this over with.",197,8723
8723,2,13,Barney ,"Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in. This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art. I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift.",198,8724
8724,2,13,Lily ,Thank you.,199,8725
8725,2,13,Barney ,"I meant me. Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence. Goofy and unburdened, with wit. But me, I want something more regal. Something my progeny could look at and say, ""There's stands Barnabus Stinson."" He was wise... and strong.",200,8726
8726,2,13,Lily ,I don't think your sword will fit.,201,8727
8727,2,13,Barney ,I get that a lot.,202,8728
8728,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,"And so, as Lily began painting, Marshall thought about the $5,000 and what his fiancee was doing to earn it.",203,8729
8729,2,13,Marshall ,This isn't right. This isn't right at all.,204,8730
8730,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,"Finally, he could take it no more.",205,8731
8731,2,13,Lily ,Hold still. Hold still. Hold still!,206,8732
8732,2,13,Barney ,Paint faster!,207,8733
8733,2,13,Lily ,"Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts.",208,8734
8734,2,13,Barney ,"Yeah. Wait, wait! That wasn't enough buildup. I need... In a world without justice, one man...",209,8735
8735,2,13,Lily ,"Oh, just drop them!",210,8736
8736,2,13,Barney ,All right.,211,8737
8737,2,13,Marshall ,"No! No, this is not right!",212,8738
8738,2,13,Barney ,We had a deal!,213,8739
8739,2,13,Marshall ,"Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out!",214,8740
8740,2,13,Barney ,You...!,215,8741
8741,2,13,Marshall ,"It's over! (he closes the door at Barney's face). (Yelling) Lily, I can't let you go through with this! (whispering) I found a castle we can stay in, but it's an extra two grand. (Yelling) It's just not right! (whispering). It's beautiful and they say it's haunted.",216,8742
8742,2,13,Barney ,"Before you say anything, I'll give you an extra five grand.",217,8743
8743,2,13,Marshall , We accept.,218,8744
8744,2,13,Barney ,"You people are so easy to control. Dance for me, puppets, dance.",219,8745
8745,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,And that's how Uncle Barney paid for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.,220,8746
8746,2,13,Mr Druthers," Come on, Ted, listen, why don't we get back and finish drawing the plans for a building which, in my opinion, is never going to get built, so you and I can get out of here and grab a couple of beers.",221,8747
8747,2,13,Ted ,"No. Look, Hammond, there's no easy way to say this but...",222,8748
8748,2,13,Man ,Looking for Hammond Druthers.,223,8749
8749,2,13,Mr Druthers," Oh, that's me. I'm Hammond Druthers.",224,8750
8750,2,13,Man ,These are divorce papers. You've been served.,225,8751
8751,2,13,Ted ,"Oh, God.",226,8752
8752,2,13,Mr Druthers, She's really going through with this. So that's it. It's over.,227,8753
8753,2,13,Ted ,"There is no easy way to say this, but...",228,8754
8754,2,13,Mr Druthers," She's giving me the remains of Wolfie? My dog is dead? Oh, my God. I can't believe this. She always played too rough with him.",229,8755
8755,2,13,Ted ,"Believe me, there is no easy way to say this...",230,8756
8756,2,13,Men (singing) ,# Happy birthday to you... #,231,8757
8757,2,13,Ted ,You've got to be kidding me!,232,8758
8758,2,13,Mr Druthers," Guys, you have no idea how much this means to me right now.",233,8759
8759,2,13,Ted ,"Wait, his birthday was yesterday!",234,8760
8760,2,13,Man ,"Yeah, but a bunch of us were up at the conference in Montreal, so we thought...",235,8761
8761,2,13,Ted ,"No! No birthday! No! I got something to say and I'm gonna get it out. Hammond, listen to me. I am sorry that your dog died, and that your wife is divorcing you and that... your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday. And there is no easy way to say... What are you doing? What's going on?",236,8762
8762,2,13,Mr Druthers," Oh, God...",237,8763
8763,2,13,Ted ,"Oh, come on, you're not going to pull that, are you? Oh! Look, yeah, right. Now we're falling onto the ground. Well, nice try, but guess what? You're fired! You're fired, you get it? You hear me? You're gone! You're fired! (Mr Druthers is taken on a stretcher with an oxygen mask on his face.) In my defense, I think we all suspected Hammond might have been faking. On the plus side, the EMTs seem to think he's going to be just fine and, as you saw, they did admit that I did not cause the heart attack, even if they said it a bit begrudgingly.",238,8764
8764,2,13,Ted (voix off) ,"And there it was, rock bottom: They all hated me. But just when all seemed lost, I had the greatest idea of my entire career.",239,8765
8765,2,13,Man ,"Margarita Fridays--great idea, boss.",240,8766
8766,2,13,Lily ,"Okay, it's done. I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it.",241,8767
8767,2,13,Barney ,"Thank you very much, Lily.",242,8768
8768,2,13,Lily ,"Marshall, do you have the money?",243,8769
8769,2,13,Marshall ,Yeah.,244,8770
8770,2,13,Lily ,Let's get out of here!,245,8771
8771,2,13,Barney ,A smooth area?! You gave me the Ken doll?! Marshall and Lily get out of the apartment. She left out Little Barney. Barnacle Junior. My Barnana is... Barnito Supreme.,246,8772
8772,2,14,Ted (voix off) ,"Kids, I told you stories about all the big holidays - Christmas... Halloween... Thanksgiving... but one holiday was always my favorite-- Super Bowl Sunday. And there was one Super Bowl back in 2007 that I will never forget.",1,8773
8773,2,14,Ted ,"Marshall, you're on beer detail. Lily, you're making the bean dip. Uh, Robin, you're on chips and pretzels, and Barney, I'm giving you nothing to do so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem.",2,8774
8774,2,14,Barney ,"""Problem."" Oh, poor Superman, he should really do something about his flying problem. It's not a problem if you're awesome at it.",3,8775
8775,2,14,Ted ,"And I will be going to Quinn's to pick up the world's greatest food, the Super Bowl Hot Wings Platter.",4,8776
8776,2,14,Marshall ,"If I were a chicken, I'd go cannibal for those bad boys. Just eat my own damn wing off. I don't care. I'm crazy like that.",5,8777
8777,2,14,The waitress, Here's the info for tomorrow night.,6,8778
8778,2,14,Ted ,What's tomorrow night?,7,8779
8779,2,14,The waitress," Oh, God, you didn't hear? Mark died.",8,8780
8780,2,14,Lily ,"Oh, my God.",9,8781
8781,2,14,Marshall ,"Oh, my gosh.",10,8782
8782,2,14,The waitress," The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00, and I know it would have meant a lot to Mark if you came. You guys were his favorite customers.",11,8783
8783,2,14,All ,Stay strong. We're so sorry. (the waitress leaves),12,8784
8784,2,14,Ted ,Who was Mark?,13,8785
8785,2,14,Marshall ,No idea.,14,8786
8786,2,14,Barney ,Not a clue.,15,8787
8787,2,14,Lily ,"Well, I guess we should go, right?",16,8788
8788,2,14,Marshall ,"Wait... tomorrow night at 6:00, that's the Super Bowl.",17,8789
8789,2,14,Ted ,"Okay, I feel terrible, but the truth is we didn't know Mike.",18,8790
8790,2,14,Lily ,Mark.,19,8791
8791,2,14,Ted ,"Mark, and as long as we send flowers, I can't think of any reason we'd have to Carl (at the bar): Get out of here! I never want to see your face in this bar again! This soulless b*st*rd just told me he can't come to Mark's funeral because he wants to watch the Super Bowl. Could you believe that? You guys are coming, right?",20,8792
8792,2,14,All ,Yes... Wouldn't miss for the world.,21,8793
8793,2,14,Ted ,"Okay, here's the plan: record the game, go to the funeral, pay our respects to Matt...",22,8794
8794,2,14,Lily ,Mark.,23,8795
8795,2,14,Ted ,"Mark, and start watching only an hour late.",24,8796
8796,2,14,Marshall ,"Okay, that's great, but just to make sure it records, maybe we should bow our heads and say a quiet prayer to the TiVo gods.",25,8797
8797,2,14,Ted ,"Almighty TiVo, we thank you for all the gifts you have given us: the power to freeze live TV to go take a leak is nothing short of Godlike. Let's not forget fast-forwarding through commercials. It seems greedy to ask anything more from you, O magic box, but if you malfunction and miss the Super Bowl, we will destroy you in the",26,8798
8798,2,14,Marshall ,Amen.,27,8799
8799,2,14,Ted ,Amen.,28,8800
8800,2,14,Lily ,We are not fast-forwarding through the commercials.,29,8801
8801,2,14,Robin ,"Yeah, they're the best part.",30,8802
8802,2,14,Ted ,"Oh, come on. Remember last year? Who wants to watch a monkey in a coconut bra order a pizza?",31,8803
8803,2,14,Robin ,"Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute.",32,8804
8804,2,14,Barney ,"Seriously, that's the last time I'm gonna call you today. Okay. Good-bye. You didn't hang up either! I know! You hang up! You hang up! My bookie. Great guy.",33,8805
8805,2,14,Ted ,So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up?,34,8806
8806,2,14,Barney ,"Have I taught you nothing, Ted?",35,8807
8807,2,14,Ted ,Virtually.,36,8808
8808,2,14,Barney ,Suits are full of joy. They're the sartorial equivalent of a baby's smile.,37,8809
8809,2,14,Ted ,"Sartorial""?",38,8810
8810,2,14,Barney ,"""Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade."" Suits are for the living. That's why when it's my time to R.I.P. I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it buck naked. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies. What up?!",39,8811
8811,2,14,Barney ,Such a waste.,40,8812
8812,2,14,Lily ,I know. He was so young.,41,8813
8813,2,14,Barney ,"A hand-stitched, cashmere, double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana. It must be so frightened.",42,8814
8814,2,14,Robin ,"This is going faster than I thought. We'll make an appearance at the bar for the wake, we'll be watching the game by 8:00.",43,8815
8815,2,14,Carl ,"And even though we didn't see any whales, Mark and I both said it was the best day of our lives. Okay, I'm getting us another round. And when I come back, everyone else is telling their favorite Mark story.",44,8816
8816,2,14,Marshall ,Dibs on the one Carl just told.,45,8817
8817,2,14,Robin ,"Okay, I have to be at work exactly one Super Bowl from now.",46,8818
8818,2,14,Lily ,"Oh, let's face it, we're not going to get to watch it. We should just find out the score.",47,8819
8819,2,14,Barney ,"Oh, thank God! I'll find out.",48,8820
8820,2,14,Ted ,"No, no, no, we can't! We have to watch the game together. It's tradition. Think of all the great times we've had watching this game.",49,8821
8821,2,14,Ted ,"Second down, everyone drink.",50,8822
8822,2,14,Barney ,"Ted, it's not a drinking game if you drink anytime anything happens.",51,8823
8823,2,14,Marshall ,"Are these chicken wings or angel wings? God, I love these things.",52,8824
8824,2,14,Ted ,"I love you guys. This is so great, all of us watching the Super Bowl together. This is special. We need to do this every year, promise me!",53,8825
8825,2,14,Marshall ,"Calm down, buddy.",54,8826
8826,2,14,Lily ,"Oh, commercials!",55,8827
8827,2,14,Ted ,Everyone drink!,56,8828
8828,2,14,Ted ,"God, this is such a great tradition, all of us watching the game together. How did this start?",57,8829
8829,2,14,Marshall ,"Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks that Casey misses this field goal.",58,8830
8830,2,14,Barney ,I don't bet. Betting's for suckers.,59,8831
8831,2,14,Marshall ,"Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal.",60,8832
8832,2,14,Barney ,Fine.,61,8833
8833,2,14,Marshall ,"See, there you go, he made it. You win.",62,8834
8834,2,14,Barney ,"Wait. This is mine, just like that? God, that feels good. No, that feels really... good. What else can we bet on?",63,8835
8835,2,14,Marshall ,"Nothing, it's the halftime show.",64,8836
8836,2,14,Lily ,"Oh, so lame. Nobody even pays attention. I mean, Janet Jackson, who cares?",65,8837
8837,2,14,Ted ,"God, how cool is Robin?",66,8838
8838,2,14,Marshall ,I can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months to our sacred day. Now she's gonna be in all the pictures.,67,8839
8839,2,14,Barney ,"Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks plus six points for 500 bucks.",68,8840
8840,2,14,Marshall ,Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.,69,8841
8841,2,14,Barney ,"$50?! What fun is $50?! Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall! Okay, $50.",70,8842
8842,2,14,Robin ,"Hey, I'll take that action. Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand. Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings? Oh, commercials! Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious.",71,8843
8843,2,14,Ted ,"Look, we always watch the Super Bowl together. So we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 6:00 and go the next 18 hours without finding out who won.",72,8844
8844,2,14,Barney ,That's impossible.,73,8845
8845,2,14,Ted ,"I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy. That means no TV, no Internet, no newspapers, nothing. Media blackout. But our tradition lives on. Who's in?",74,8846
8846,2,14,Lily ,I'm in.,75,8847
8847,2,14,Robin ,I'm in.,76,8848
8848,2,14,Marshall ,I'm in.,77,8849
8849,2,14,Barney ,"What the hell, I'm in. High five!",78,8850
8850,2,14,Ted ,"Dude, we're at a wake.",79,8851
8851,2,14,Barney ,Sorry. Solemn low five.,80,8852
8852,2,14,Ted (voix off) ,"As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world.",81,8853
8853,2,14,Barney ,"Hey, take this key and swallow it.",82,8854
8854,2,14,Ted ,What? No.,83,8855
8855,2,14,Barney ,"Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time.",84,8856
8856,2,14,Ted ,"Lots more, no.",85,8857
8857,2,14,Barney ,"I'm not messing around, Theodore. I've got a lot of money riding on this game. If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator, I'll check the score. Please take the key.",86,8858
8858,2,14,Ted ,Fine. But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan and I think that's funny.,87,8859
8859,2,14,Ted (voix off) ,"The media blackout was particularly hard on Robin because, well, she was the media.",88,8860
8860,2,14,Robin ,"But unfortunately, the City won't be fixing the unusually large pothole any time soon, so buckle up if you're on the BQE. It's gonna be a bumpy one.",89,8861
8861,2,14,Kevin ,Like morning commutes needed to get any harder.,90,8862
8862,2,14,Man ,"You're right, Kevin.",91,8863
8863,2,14,Kevin ,"Well, Robin, what do you say? I think it's time to check in with Sid for a sports update.",92,8864
8864,2,14,Robin ,No!,93,8865
8865,2,14,Kevin ,What?,94,8866
8866,2,14,Robin ,No.,95,8867
8867,2,14,Kevin ,"But it's, uh, time for Sports.",96,8868
8868,2,14,Robin ,"No, it's not. It's time for Weather.",97,8869
8869,2,14,Kevin ,"We, we just did Weather.",98,8870
8870,2,14,Robin ,"Well, weather's pretty fickle, it may have changed. What's it doing out there, Lou?",99,8871
8871,2,14,Lou ,"Pretty much the same thing it was two minutes ago. Back to you, Robin.",100,8872
8872,2,14,Kevin ,"Okay, now it's time for Sports.",101,8873
8873,2,14,Robin ,No! Let's go to Traffic Todd in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper.,102,8874
8874,2,14,Kevin ,"Robin, it's time for Sports! Over to you, Sid.",103,8875
8875,2,14,Sid ,"Thank you, Kevin and Robin. Let's talk about the Super Bowl.",104,8876
8876,2,14,Ted (voix off) ,"Weeks earlier, Marshall had promised Lily he'd come into her kindergarten class for show-and-tell day.",105,8877
8877,2,14,Lily ,And he's a little bit double-jointed... And his favorite animal is the Loch Ness monster.,106,8878
8878,2,14,Marshall ,"Lily, how many times...? Nessie is a gentle creature. We're trying to stay away from terms like ""Monster.""",107,8879
8879,2,14,Lily ,"Well, I think we can all agree, he is much more interesting than Sally's one-eyed goldfish. Three weeks in a row? Come on, Sally. Okay, well, that's all the time we have. Arts and crafts, everybody.",108,8880
8880,2,14,Doug ,Hey. I'm Doug.,109,8881
8881,2,14,Marshall ,"Oh, hey, I'm Marshall.",110,8882
8882,2,14,Doug ,Are you going to be staying here for the rest of day?,111,8883
8883,2,14,Marshall ,"Yeah, I'm actually trying to hide out 'cause I don't want to know who won the Super Bowl.",112,8884
8884,2,14,Doug , I know who won.,113,8885
8885,2,14,Marshall ,"Oh, um, that's great, but I really don't want to know, so if you could just keep that to yourself.",114,8886
8886,2,14,Doug ,How badly do you not want to know?,115,8887
8887,2,14,Marshall ,Excuse me?,116,8888
8888,2,14,Doug ,Ten bucks.,117,8889
8889,2,14,Marshall ,Are you serious?,118,8890
8890,2,14,Doug ,Just went up to eight.,119,8891
8891,2,14,Barney ,"Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries.",120,8892
8892,2,14,Ted ,Not until game time.,121,8893
8893,2,14,Barney ,Where are you going?,122,8894
8894,2,14,Ted ,Pick up the hot wings.,123,8895
8895,2,14,Barney ,What? How the hell are you planning on getting in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score? There's TVs everywhere.,124,8896
8896,2,14,Ted ,"Ah, don't worry. I got it all planned out. First of all: I placed duct tape on a pair of sunglasses so I can only see out of two tiny holes. Next, I constructed blinders out of an old cereal box. Top it all off: high-tech noise-reducing headphones I bought when Marshall and Lily first got back together and were doing it a lot. I call it the Sensory Deprivator 5000.",125,8897
8897,2,14,Ted ,"Hello! Uh, my name is Ted Mosby. I'm here to pick up my hot wings. In my hand, you'll find the exact total for the wings plus a generous tip. Please take the cash. Put the wings in my hand and I'll be on my way. Thank you!",126,8898
8898,2,14,Sid ,"And that closes the book on one heck of a Super Bowl. Back to you, Kevin and Robin.",127,8899
8899,2,14,Kevin ,We'll be right back.,128,8900
8900,2,14,Man ,And we're clear.,129,8901
8901,2,14,Robin ,I'm sorry.,130,8902
8902,2,14,Woman ,"Um, Robin, is it just me, or were you doing something different there?",131,8903
8903,2,14,Robin ,"I haven't watched the game yet. I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl. I mean, change the teleprompter. No team names, nothing specific.",132,8904
8904,2,14,Woman ,That is crazy. I can't do that.,133,8905
8905,2,14,Robin ,My friend Mark passed away this week.,134,8906
8906,2,14,Woman ,"Okay, sweety okay. Okay, I'm so sorry.",135,8907
8907,2,14,Man ,Back in five... four... three...,136,8908
8908,2,14,Robin ,It's just so hard.,137,8909
8909,2,14,Ted ,Ha! Who's the idiot now?! You said the Sensory Deprivator 5000 was stupid. But it totally worked! (barney leaves and Ted doesn't notice.) I couldn't see or hear anything happening around me. Right?! Right?! (He takes his glasses off) No...!,138,8910
8910,2,14,Ted (voix off) ,"And if that weren't bad enough, I was about to have a horrible realization.",139,8911
8911,2,14,Ted ,Where's the dipping sauce?,140,8912
8912,2,14,Doug ,"The team that won, want to know what their name rhymes with?",141,8913
8913,2,14,Marshall ,"Come on, dude. You promised you'd stop if I ate all those crayons. Why are you doing this?",142,8914
8914,2,14,Doug ,I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.,143,8915
8915,2,14,Marshall ,"Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin, she's mine.",144,8916
8916,2,14,Lily ,"Okay, now who did this?",145,8917
8917,2,14,Marshall ,I did.,146,8918
8918,2,14,Doug ,Does that mean Marshall gets a time-out?,147,8919
8919,2,14,Lily ,"Well, Marshall's a grownup, so...",148,8920
8920,2,14,Doug ,"When one of us breaks something, we get a time-out.",149,8921
8921,2,14,Lily ,Sorry. Marshall gets a time-out.,150,8922
8922,2,14,Robin ,"And after the Super Bowl, the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up, sending the mayor of the winning team's city 15 pounds of a delicacy his of her city is famous for. Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor.",151,8923
8923,2,14,Doug ,Hey. Hey.,152,8924
8924,2,14,Marshall ,I'm not talking to you.,153,8925
8925,2,14,Doug ,"Yes, you are. You'll do whatever I say. Hold your breath.",154,8926
8926,2,14,Marshall ,I'm not holding my breath.,155,8927
8927,2,14,Doug ,The winning team was the... (Marshall holds his breath) Now here's how this is going to work: you're going to take me to three R-rated movies a week...,156,8928
8928,2,14,Ted (voix off) ,"And then Uncle Marshall got an idea. It was not one he was proud of in retrospect, but desperate times...",157,8929
8929,2,14,Marshall ,"Oh, no. Somebody wet their pants.",158,8930
8930,2,14,Doug ,"No, I didn't.",159,8931
8931,2,14,Marshall ,"Oh, really? Who's everyone gonna believe? I'm a grownup third-year law student at Columbia and you're just a little pants wetter. So now I ask you a question: You want to be able to quietly sneak off to the restroom and dry off or am I gonna have something for show and tell today? Hey, everyone...",160,8932
8932,2,14,Doug ,"Okay, okay. You win.",161,8933
8933,2,14,Marshall ,I want my money back. And your pudding snack pack.,162,8934
8934,2,14,Barney ,"Sir, who won the Super Bowl?",163,8935
8935,2,14,Man ,Sorry. I missed the game.,164,8936
8936,2,14,Barney ,You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!,165,8937
8937,2,14,Man 2, I... don't really follow sports.,166,8938
8938,2,14,Barney ,"Oh, my...! Emmitt Smith! Oh, thank God.",167,8939
8939,2,14,Emmitt Smith," Yeah, I get that a lot.",168,8940
8940,2,14,Barney ,"You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?",169,8941
8941,2,14,Emmitt Smith," The game was last night? You know, once you win two or three of those things, it's kind of like, eh.",170,8942
8942,2,14,Barney ,"But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?!",171,8943
8943,2,14,Emmitt Smith," Dance, my friend. Dance.",172,8944
8944,2,14,Barney ,No...!,173,8945
8945,2,14,Ted ,Hello! It's me again.,174,8946
8946,2,14,Barman ,Oh! I didn't recognize you.,175,8947
8947,2,14,Ted ,"Yeah, you forgot to give me the dipping sauce! Ah. Yes. This is the one.",176,8948
8948,2,14,Ted (voix off) ,"It was 4:00, and so far, all of us had done the impossible. But then, almost simultaneously, things started to go wrong.",177,8949
8949,2,14,Robin ,And let's end the day on a happy note. There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo. Trish Sanchez has the story.,178,8950
8950,2,14,Man 1," Hey, buddy.",179,8951
8951,2,14,Man 2," Hey, dude, look out.",180,8952
8952,2,14,Trish Sanchez, And in honor of yesterday's big win...,181,8953
8953,2,14,Man 1," Hey, buddy, look out.",182,8954
8954,2,14,Man 2," Dude, watch out!",183,8955
8955,2,14,Trish Sanchez, ...the zoo decided to name the baby panda after Super Bowl champions...,184,8956
8956,2,14,Robin ,No...!,185,8957
8957,2,14,Marshall (at school) ,No...!,186,8958
8958,2,14,Barney (tearing the newspaper) ,No...!,187,8959
8959,2,14,Ted ,Yes...!,188,8960
8960,2,14,Ted ,"Awesome. Just in time for kick-off. None of you guys found out the score, right?",189,8961
8961,2,14,Robin ,Mission accomplished.,190,8962
8962,2,14,Lily ,Didn't find out.,191,8963
8963,2,14,Ted ,"Great. Let's do it. I already fast-forwarded through the four hours of pre-game coverage. So we are ready. (Barney comes in) Barney, I can't even look at you. I don't want any sign of who won.",192,8964
8964,2,14,Ted ,"Don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away. Feel free to start without me. Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! So much money! You screwed it up, Barney! You screwed everything up! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Okay, let's watch the game.",193,8965
8965,2,14,Ted ,"Barney, what the hell was that? We know who you bet on. Now you've ruined the game for everyone.",194,8966
8966,2,14,Lily ,"Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.",195,8967
8967,2,14,Robin ,Way to blow it.,196,8968
8968,2,14,Marshall ,"Yeah, I didn't know and now I do know.",197,8969
8969,2,14,Ted ,There's no point in even watching the game.,198,8970
8970,2,14,Lily ,"Well, at least the commercials aren't ruined.",199,8971
8971,2,14,Marshall ,Wings are still good.,200,8972
8972,2,14,Robin ,Beer still works.,201,8973
8973,2,14,Ted ,"Ah, what the hell. Let's watch Barney lose some money.",202,8974
8974,2,14,Marshall ,"Hey, so check this out: I got extorted by a five-year-old today.",203,8975
8975,2,14,Robin ,I almost got fired today.,204,8976
8976,2,14,Barney ,I met Emmitt Smith today.,205,8977
8977,2,14,Lily ,"Ooh, you go first.",206,8978
8978,2,14,Ted ,I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000.,207,8979
8979,2,14,Lily ,"Yeah, go ahead, Barney.",208,8980
8980,2,14,Barney ,"Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game...",209,8981
8981,2,14,Ted (voix off) ,"And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that?",210,8982
8982,2,14,Barney ,"I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss?",211,8983
8983,2,14,Ted ,"50-50, give or take.",212,8984
8984,2,14,Barney ,"Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks, whether or not there'd be a safety, first...",213,8985
8985,2,15,Ted (voix off) ,"Kids, never underestimate the power of destiny. Because when you least expect it, the littlest thing can cause a ripple effect that changes your life. Take for instance my trip to Chicago.",1,8986
8986,2,15,Robin ,That security guard was a little bit handsy.,2,8987
8987,2,15,Ted ,"That's funny. She barely touched me. Uh, Gate 23. Come on. If we miss this flight, I will never forgive myself.",3,8988
8988,2,15,Ted (voix off) ,Why was this flight so important? Let's back up a few months to the fall of 2006. I had just sold my first building design and become the youngest project manager in my firm's history. Suddenly I was being headhunted. One firm was even considering me to run their entire New York office. They were flying me in for a final interview at their corporate headquarters in Chicago. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. It was my destiny. There was just one problem.,4,8989
8989,2,15,Ted ,"Hi, wait, two more.",5,8990
8990,2,15,Woman ,"Sorry, you're too late, I already shut the doors.",6,8991
8991,2,15,Ted ,"Well, I'm sure if we pull real hard we can open them.",7,8992
8992,2,15,Woman ,"Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but see, once I close those doors, that's it. Nobody else is allowed down that jet-way. Except for that guy.",8,8993
8993,2,15,Ted ,"Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss the chance to interview for my dream job.",9,8994
8994,2,15,Woman ,"I'm sorry, sir.",10,8995
8995,2,15,Robin ,"His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job? Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do? I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night dreaming about being a... I mean, uh... This is a cool job.",11,8996
8996,2,15,Ted ,"Please, I have to be on this flight.",12,8997
8997,2,15,Woman ,I'll see what I can do. But it doesn't look good.,13,8998
8998,2,15,Ted ,Thanks.,14,8999
8999,2,15,Robin ,Your uniforms are pretty.,15,9000
9000,2,15,Woman ,"Okay. They haven't armed the doors yet, so you still have a chance. It's up to the captain now and they're calling us back.",16,9001
9001,2,15,Ted ,"Great, please let us know as soon as you hear anything.",17,9002
9002,2,15,Woman ,"Sure, and for the future, we recommend you arrive at the airport an hour and a half before your flight, not, you know, one minute after.",18,9003
9003,2,15,Ted ,"Normally, I'm incredibly responsible. I just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced. Not that I'm a criminal or anything.",19,9004
9004,2,15,Rubin ,"Yeah, he just jumped a subway turnstile.",20,9005
9005,2,15,Woman ,"You seem to have a lot of problems with the rules of travel. (The phone rings) Hello? Oh, that is great news. It's my mom-- she found her missing earring. Have a seat. I'll call you when I hear something. Where was it?",21,9006
9006,2,15,Ted ,That thing better have call waiting.,22,9007
9007,2,15,Robin ,Could you just call the firm and explain what happened?,23,9008
9008,2,15,Ted ,It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today. I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage. I'm so stupid. Why did I have to jump that turnstile?,24,9009
9009,2,15,Robin ,"Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault?",25,9010
9010,2,15,Ted (voix off) ,She had a point. It was kind of Barney's fault. Let's back up a few months.,26,9011
9011,2,15,Robin ,"Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe?",27,9012
9012,2,15,Marshall ,"Oh, man, it kills.",28,9013
9013,2,15,Lily ,"You want some aspirin, baby?",29,9014
9014,2,15,Marshall ,You know I don't believe in pain killers.,30,9015
9015,2,15,Ted ,"Wow, your first broken bone. Kind of kills your whole ""Unbreakable"" theory.",31,9016
9016,2,15,Lily ,Marshall used to think he was indestructible.,32,9017
9017,2,15,Marshall ,"Well, it added up. I've never broken anything. I've never been sick, and when I need to, I can summon incredible strength. Ted, tell her the story of the really heavy door.",33,9018
9018,2,15,Ted ,There was a really heavy door. He opened it.,34,9019
9019,2,15,Marshall ,On one pull.,35,9020
9020,2,15,Robin ,"Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow.",36,9021
9021,2,15,Marshall ,"Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste.",37,9022
9022,2,15,Barney ,Training for a marathon.,38,9023
9023,2,15,Marshall ,What?,39,9024
9024,2,15,Barney ,You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.,40,9025
9025,2,15,Marshall ,"You're kidding, right?",41,9026
9026,2,15,Barney ,Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.,42,9027
9027,2,15,Marshall ,"So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?",43,9028
9028,2,15,Barney ,Absolutely.,44,9029
9029,2,15,Robin ,"Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers.",45,9030
9030,2,15,Ted ,"Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles.",46,9031
9031,2,15,Barney ,"Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two.",47,9032
9032,2,15,,Marshall:,48,9033
9033,2,15,Barney ,"50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it $10,000.",49,9034
9034,2,15,Marshall ,You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.,50,9035
9035,2,15,Barney ,"Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50.",51,9036
9036,2,15,Ted (voix off) ,"The next morning, as the marathon began, we were focused on Marshall's computer.",52,9037
9037,2,15,Marshall ,"Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online, see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe.",53,9038
9038,2,15,Robin ,"Ooh, he's starting!",54,9039
9039,2,15,Marshall ,This ought to be good. Wow. (48 minutes later) He's already passing the second checkpoint.,55,9040
9040,2,15,Lily ,"This tracking thing is amazing. When we get married, you're getting one of these.",56,9041
9041,2,15,Robin ,Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive.,57,9042
9042,2,15,Marshall ,"He's gotta be cheating, okay. He knew we'd check.",58,9043
9043,2,15,Ted ,"Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet. Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang ""Hungry Like the Wolf,"" and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to?",59,9044
9044,2,15,Marshall ,"Well, it looks like, ""Barney"" should be coming over the Queensboro Bridge and up First Avenue within the next hour or so. But... there is no way that that's really him.",60,9045
9045,2,15,Marshall ,It's really him.,61,9046
9046,2,15,Lily ,"Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run!",62,9047
9047,2,15,Barney ,"What up, non-finishers?",63,9048
9048,2,15,Ted ,"Wow. Very impressive, Barney.",64,9049
9049,2,15,Barney ,"Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won.",65,9050
9050,2,15,Lily ,I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.,66,9051
9051,2,15,Barney ,So where's my 50 bucks?,67,9052
9052,2,15,Marshall ,"All right. I got to admit, you earned this.",68,9053
9053,2,15,Barney ,"Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym.",69,9054
9054,2,15,Marshall ,"Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today.",70,9055
9055,2,15,Barney ,"Wow. You know I really should check out this ""subway."" Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.",71,9056
9056,2,15,Ted ,You're dating a girl from New Jersey?,72,9057
9057,2,15,Barney ,No.,73,9058
9058,2,15,Ted (voix off) ,So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon. But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call.,74,9059
9059,2,15,Ted ,Hello?,75,9060
9060,2,15,Barney ,"Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway.",76,9061
9061,2,15,Ted ,"What, what are you talking about?",77,9062
9062,2,15,Barney ,"I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.",78,9063
9063,2,15,Barney ,"Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean.",79,9064
9064,2,15,Voice ,86th street.,80,9065
9065,2,15,Barney ,"My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.",81,9066
9066,2,15,Ted ,(to Marshall) Barney's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train.,82,9067
9067,2,15,Marshall ,Best 50 bucks I ever spent.,83,9068
9068,2,15,Barney ,"Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?",84,9069
9069,2,15,Ted ,All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.,85,9070
9070,2,15,Barney ,"Ted, Ted.",86,9071
9071,2,15,Woman ,"Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?",87,9072
9072,2,15,Barney ,I'm sorry. I can't.,88,9073
9073,2,15,Old lady, Douche.,89,9074
9074,2,15,Ted ,Barney?!,90,9075
9075,2,15,Barney ,Ted!,91,9076
9076,2,15,Policeman ,Hey!,92,9077
9077,2,15,Barney ,No...!,93,9078
9078,2,15,Robin ,"See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight.",94,9079
9079,2,15,Ted ,You're right. Everything can be traced back to him. Like that rash we all got at Christmas. I have to see what's going on.,95,9080
9080,2,15,Woman ,So I was able to get you two seats.,96,9081
9081,2,15,Ted ,Really? That's great!,97,9082
9082,2,15,Woman ,"No, no, not you. I'm talking to my mom about Blue Man Group. Ma, can I call you back?",98,9083
9083,2,15,Ted ,"Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on?",99,9084
9084,2,15,Woman ,I'm still waiting for... Huh. Looks like your flight left already.,100,9085
9085,2,15,Ted ,"What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today.",101,9086
9086,2,15,Robin ,"Well, he never even called you back?",102,9087
9087,2,15,Woman ,"Well, it's typical pilot.They don't call you back at work and they don't call you back after you spend two nights with them at a Radisson in Orlando.",103,9088

9089,2,15,Robin ,What was the name of the airline again?,105,9090
9090,2,15,Ted ,I think it was something like Flights R' Us.,106,9091
9091,2,15,Robin ,"Was the ""R"" backwards?",107,9092
9092,2,15,Ted ,"God, I hope not.",108,9093
9093,2,15,Robin ,Geez.,109,9094
9094,2,15,Ted ,Stupid smart carts. More like dumb carts.,110,9095
9095,2,15,Robin ,"If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault.",111,9096
9096,2,15,Ted ,"You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.",112,9097
9097,2,15,Robin ,"Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault?",113,9098
9098,2,15,Ted (voix off) ,"For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April.",114,9099
9099,2,15,Marshall ,My pants are starting to feel a little tight.,115,9100
9100,2,15,Lily ,"Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly.",116,9101
9101,2,15,Marshall ,I cannot allow this.,117,9102
9102,2,15,Lily ,What?,118,9103
9103,2,15,Marshall ,I am going to run the New York City Marathon.,119,9104
9104,2,15,Lily ,"""It is important to load up on carbohydrates two to four hours before a big run. Try a breakfast of a bagel, a banana, oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice."" Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said.",120,9105
9105,2,15,Marshall ,"Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style. Liquids are digested faster. That way, no energy is wasted, and it's all about the run.",121,9106
9106,2,15,Lily ,"""Don't forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement.""",122,9107
9107,2,15,Marshall ,This is gonna be your best run yet. You're going to accomplish all of your goals. You are a robot sent from the future to win the marathon! You are... Marshall. You are... Marshall. You are Marshall! Yeah!,123,9108

9110,2,15,Robin ,"Marshall? Oh, my God!",126,9111
9111,2,15,Ted ,"So, yes, it was your fault. I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time! (Ted fells) And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport.",127,9112
9112,2,15,Robin ,That really wasn't my fault. I wouldn't have walked in on,128,9113
9113,2,15,Robin ,"Hey, what's going on here?",129,9114
9114,2,15,Ted ,"Oh, looks like they're camping out for something.",130,9115
9115,2,15,Robin ,"Yeah, but for what?",131,9116
9116,2,15,Ted ,"I don't know. Usually there's a Stormtrooper or Klingon in line to give you some indication. ""Annual wedding dress blowout. Designer sample dresses up to 90% off. Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m.""",132,9117
9117,2,15,Robin ,"Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks?",133,9118
9118,2,15,Lily ,We have to camp out.,134,9119
9119,2,15,Robin ,Are you serious?,135,9120
9120,2,15,Lily ,"You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun.",136,9121
9121,2,15,Barney , I can't go. I've got this thing.,137,9122
9122,2,15,Lily ,What thing?,138,9123
9123,2,15,Barney ,A pen1s.,139,9124
9124,2,15,Robin ,This is the place.,140,9125
9125,2,15,Lily ,"Oh, wow. Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet! Vera Wang! Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here?",141,9126
9126,2,15,Robin ,You said wang.,142,9127
9127,2,15,Lily ,"Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998. Only fewer mullets.",143,9128
9128,2,15,Robin ,"You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York.",144,9129
9129,2,15,Lily ,"Ooh, this is comfy. We might actually be able to sleep.",145,9130
9130,2,15,Robin ,That's kind of annoying.,146,9131
9131,2,15,Lily ,"Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute. (5 hours later) I don't think I can take this. Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again, but then it does. Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on?",147,9132
9132,2,15,Robin ,"It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along?",148,9133
9133,2,15,Lily ,"If we get through this, I swear I'm gonna live my life differently.",149,9134
9134,2,15,Robin ,I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time.,150,9135
9135,2,15,Man ,"Morning, ladies.",151,9136
9136,2,15,Lily ,It's him. It's the car guy!,152,9137

9138,2,15,Ted (voix off) ,"The next morning, Robin was too tired to go all the way back to Brooklyn, so while I was at work, she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours, and that's when...",154,9139
9139,2,15,Marshall ,Nobody does it better than you.,155,9140
9140,2,15,Robin ,"Marshall?! Oh, my God! (Marshall falls)",156,9141
9141,2,15,Robin ,"So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store, we would have made the first flight.",157,9142
9142,2,15,Ted ,"Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it. Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight.",158,9143
9143,2,15,Man ,"Oh, my God! You're that reporter from Metro News 1.",159,9144
9144,2,15,Robin ,"Yes, yes, I am. I can't believe you recognized me.",160,9145
9145,2,15,Man ,You did that story on the giant pizzas?,161,9146
9146,2,15,Ted ,Would you check to see if you have any more seats?,162,9147
9147,2,15,Man ,"One moment, sir. Were those pizzas real? Come on, were they?",163,9148
9148,2,15,Ted ,Robin...,164,9149
9149,2,15,Robin ," One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,",165,9150
9150,2,15,Man , I knew it!,166,9151
9151,2,15,Robin ,"God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight.",167,9152
9152,2,15,Man ,"Well, the, uh, flight attendants are just finishing up their final seat count. Let me see what I can find out.",168,9153
9153,2,15,Ted ,Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny?,169,9154
9154,2,15,Man ,I think it might hurt. This is such a nightmare.,170,9155
9155,2,15,Robin ,"Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out for a wedding dress?",171,9156
9156,2,15,Ted ,No. Wait. It goes back further. Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side?,172,9157
9157,2,15,Ted ,1939?! This penny's from 1939! (at the bar with Robin) A 67-year-old penny. Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II?,173,9158
9158,2,15,Robin ,"Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting.",174,9159
9159,2,15,Ted ,"Look, I know a little something about coins, and this baby is worth something to a collector.",175,9160
9160,2,15,Robin ,"No, it's not.",176,9161
9161,2,15,Ted ,"Yes, it is! You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner with the money I get for this little guy.",177,9162
9162,2,15,,Ted( voix off): And that's exactly what I did.,178,9163
9163,2,15,Robin ,You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty.,179,9164
9164,2,15,Ted ,"Hey, that's 150 times its original value. Actually, the meal was only $1.49. 1984.",180,9165
9165,2,15,Robin ,"Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again.",181,9166
9166,2,15,Ted ,How dare you.,182,9167
9167,2,15,Robin ,"Hey, what's going on?",183,9168
9168,2,15,Ted ,I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something.,184,9169
9169,2,15,Robin ,"Yeah, but for what?",185,9170
9170,2,15,Ted ,"It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town.",186,9171
9171,2,15,Robin ,"And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there, and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day.",187,9172
9172,2,15,Ted ,"Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe. Barney wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date...",188,9173
9173,2,15,Robin ,And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny.,189,9174
9174,2,15,Ted ,"I wish I did. Though that person's already been punished enough, losing a sweet penny like that.",190,9175
9175,2,15,Man ,"Uh, sir?",191,9176
9176,2,15,Ted ,"Oh, please tell me you have some good news.",192,9177
9177,2,15,Man ,"Uh, I'm afraid not. There are no extra seats on the plane. I'm sorry.",193,9178
9178,2,15,Robin ,"All, right, well, thanks for trying.",194,9179
9179,2,15,Ted ,"I can't believe this. That's it, it's over.",195,9180
9180,2,15,Robin ,"Ted, come on. Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today. Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule.",196,9181
9181,2,15,Ted (voix off) ,"But that's not what happened. They didn't reschedule. They hired someone else. And as it turned out, three months later, that guy ended up having to relocate to Chicago. Kids, funny thing about destiny, I thought I was destined to get that job. But I was wrong. My destiny was to stay in New York. Because if I hadn't, I never would have met your mother.",197,9182
9182,2,16,Ted (voix off) ,"Kids, the key to a good relationship is communication. You need to talk.",1,9183
9183,2,16,Robin ,How about Mimi's?,2,9184
9184,2,16,Ted ,"Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's.",3,9185
9185,2,16,Robin ,"Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go.",4,9186
9186,2,16,Ted ,"Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's. You love that place, remember what a great time we had the last time we were there?",5,9187
9187,2,16,Robin ,We did?,6,9188
9188,2,16,Ted ,"Yeah, yeah. We had that crazy waiter who kept going, ""You two should get married! You two should get married!""",7,9189
9189,2,16,Ted (voix off) ,It's also important to know when to stop talking.,8,9190
9190,2,16,Ted ,Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining. It was so romantic? How can you not remember this?,9,9191
9191,2,16,Robin ,Because it wasn't me.,10,9192
9192,2,16,Ted ,"Oh, right! It was... my sister.",11,9193
9193,2,16,Ted (voix off) ,"You see, by the time you've hit your late 20s, you've dated a few people, but when you're in a relationship, it's common courtesy to pretend that you haven't.",12,9194
9194,2,16,Ted ,"Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on. Remember when we went to see it? We sat in the back row.",13,9195
9195,2,16,Robin ,I've never seen Van Helsing.,14,9196
9196,2,16,Ted , That's right. I saw it with my sister.,15,9197
9197,2,16,Robin ,My boss just got back from Maui. He said it was really romantic.,16,9198
9198,2,16,Ted ,"Oh, it's so romantic.",17,9199
9199,2,16,Robin ,When were you in Maui?,18,9200
9200,2,16,Ted ,I... went... with my sister.,19,9201
9201,2,16,Robin ,"With my sister. Why do you always say that? Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people. It's silly to try to act like we didn't.",20,9202
9202,2,16,Ted ,You're right. We should just be honest.,21,9203
9203,2,16,Robin ,Totally.,22,9204
9204,2,16,Ted ,"See that girl over there? Three years ago, I totally made out with her.",23,9205
9205,2,16,Robin ,I don't want to hear that.,24,9206
9206,2,16,Ted ,What? You said...,25,9207
9207,2,16,Robin ,"God, that is so insensitive.",26,9208
9208,2,16,Ted ,Remember honesty...?,27,9209
9209,2,16,Robin ,You're a jerk!,28,9210
9210,2,16,Ted ,"Well, you're...confusing.",29,9211
9211,2,16,Marshall ,"Okay, so you have to have s*x with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go!",30,9212
9212,2,16,Barney ,I don't know. Is she fat?,31,9213
9213,2,16,Marshall ,"Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat.",32,9214
9214,2,16,Lily ,Hot off the presses!,33,9215
9215,2,16,Barney ,I-I don't take flyers.,34,9216
9216,2,16,Marshall ,You took one two seconds before you walked in here.,35,9217
9217,2,16,Barney ,That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?,36,9218
9218,2,16,Lily ,Fine. It's a flyer from my play.,37,9219
9219,2,16,Barney ,"Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid...",38,9220
9220,2,16,Marshall ,"Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good.",39,9221
9221,2,16,Barney ,"Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this. Asking someone to come see your play is like asking someone for a ride to the airport or to crash on your couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers and repeat after me: Friends don't let friends come see their crappy play.",40,9222
9222,2,16,Ted ,"Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us.",41,9223
9223,2,16,Barney ,"Yes, you should break up.",42,9224
9224,2,16,Ted ,"So, earlier tonight...",43,9225
9225,2,16,Robin ,"Mm, we should get down to the bar.",44,9226
9226,2,16,Ted ,"I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt.",45,9227
9227,2,16,Barney ,"Oh, God, why is this part of the story?",46,9228
9228,2,16,Ted ,We're getting to it.,47,9229
9229,2,16,Robin ,"Damn, my face is so dry. Is there any moisturizer around here?",48,9230
9230,2,16,Ted ,"Yeah, there's some in the bathroom. Got to moisturize! Got to keep that pretty face moist.",49,9231
9231,2,16,Lily ,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!",50,9232
9232,2,16,Barney ,What's wrong with her?,51,9233
9233,2,16,Marshall ,She hates that word.,52,9234
9234,2,16,Barney ,"What word, ""moist""?",53,9235
9235,2,16,Lily ,"No! Seriously, stop!",54,9236
9236,2,16,Robin ,"So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist... face lotion...",55,9237
9237,2,16,Robin ,"Wow, this is great stuff. Now I know the secret to your great complexion.",56,9238
9238,2,16,Ted ,What are you talking about? It's yours.,57,9239
9239,2,16,Robin ,"No, it's not.",58,9240
9240,2,16,Ted ,"Oh, well... then I guess it's Lily's.",59,9241
9241,2,16,Lily ,"No, it's not.",60,9242
9242,2,16,Robin ,"Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?",61,9243
9243,2,16,Ted ,"Um, my sister's.",62,9244
9244,2,16,Robin ,"So, in other words, some girl you went out with.",63,9245
9245,2,16,Ted ,Um... I love you.,64,9246
9246,2,16,Robin ,Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?,65,9247
9247,2,16,Lily ,It was probably Carla's. Her face was a train wreck.,66,9248
9248,2,16,Marshall ,I'm don't think Ted was dating her for her face.,67,9249
9249,2,16,Ted ,"Thank you, Marshall. Thank you so much.",68,9250
9250,2,16,Robin ,Why is that still in your apartment?,69,9251
9251,2,16,Ted ,I don't know. I just never threw it out.,70,9252
9252,2,16,Robin ,"Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl?",71,9253
9253,2,16,Ted ,"Yeah. I'm madly in love with her, and the only way I can deal with it is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion.",72,9254
9254,2,16,Robin ,Not three dollars! Try 14.,73,9255
9255,2,16,Ted ,Why is this such a big deal?,74,9256
9256,2,16,Robin ,Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer!,75,9257
9257,2,16,Ted ,"Whoa, she wasn't a whore.",76,9258
9258,2,16,Robin ,"Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town. It sounds like a whore to me. What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around?",77,9259
9259,2,16,Ted ,"Nothing. That's it. Well, except for the phone booth. And the lamp by the desk... and the...",78,9260
9260,2,16,Robin ,"No. No! No! Oh, Ted!",79,9261
9261,2,16,Lily ,"Ah, the age-old question: after you break up with someone, what do you do with the stuff?",80,9262
9262,2,16,Robin ,"Question? Ain't no question, girl. Obviously, he's got to get rid of it.",81,9263
9263,2,16,Ted ,"Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it.",82,9264
9264,2,16,Robin ,So we agreed that we would let you guys decide.,83,9265
9265,2,16,Ted ,"Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants.",84,9266
9266,2,16,Barney ,"Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.",85,9267
9267,2,16,Marshall ,"Nice, right?",86,9268
9268,2,16,Robin ,I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old,87,9269
9269,2,16,Lily ,Yes!,88,9270
9270,2,16,Barney ,"I vote they can stay. ""Check out the jackass in the parachute pants"" is a good icebreaker.",89,9271
9271,2,16,Marshall ,Ted. Ted? Ted?,90,9272
9272,2,16,Ted ,"Sorry, buddy, it's a ""no"" for me, too. Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called. Even they don't want those pants back.",91,9273
9273,2,16,Marshall ,They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside.,92,9274
9274,2,16,Barney ,"Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots.",93,9275
9275,2,16,Lily ,"All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first.",94,9276
9276,2,16,Ted ,"Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal. I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano, I don't think of Jeannie Radford, I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe. And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses. I remember when I was broke, just out of college, and I really needed a lamp. And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein. I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there.",95,9277
9277,2,16,Marshall ,"Creamsicle and turkey gravy, not at the same time.",96,9278
9278,2,16,Robin ,"Well, that's adorable, but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see.",97,9279
9279,2,16,Ex-girlfriend 1, I'm Ted's college girlfriend. He made me 12 mix tapes. How many has he made you?,98,9280
9280,2,16,Ex-girlfriend 2," He calls you ""sweetie pie""? He called me ""sweetie pie.""",99,9281
9281,2,16,Ex-girlfriend 3," I'm stupid, but my rack is bigger than yours.",100,9282
9282,2,16,Ted ,Really? You can't look at a pillow without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow!,101,9283
9283,2,16,Robin ,"Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross.",102,9284
9284,2,16,Ted ,You're creepy and gross.,103,9285
9285,2,16,Robin ,Your mom's creepy and gross.,104,9286
9286,2,16,Lily ,"Order! Order! I got to side with Robin. She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff upsets her, you got to get rid of it.",105,9287
9287,2,16,Marshall ,I've got to side with Ted. Just 'cause you still have something an ex girlfriend gave you doesn't mean you're holding onto her.,106,9288
9288,2,16,Ted ,"All right, Barney. It all comes down to you.",107,9289
9289,2,16,Barney ,I side with Robin.,108,9290
9290,2,16,Ted ,What?,109,9291
9291,2,16,Barney ,"Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.",110,9292
9292,2,16,Robin ,"Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?",111,9293
9293,2,16,Ted ,"Just stop, sweetie.",112,9294
9294,2,16,Ted (voix off) ,"So I had no choice. I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends. It was painful, but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night. New York is famous for its theater, but there's many different levels. There's Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, homeless people screaming in the park, and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in.",113,9295
9295,2,16,Robin ,"Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?",114,9296
9296,2,16,Barney ,"From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory.",115,9297
9297,2,16,Ted ,Where do you guys want to sit?,116,9298
9298,2,16,Barney ,I know where I don't want to sit.,117,9299
9299,2,16,Marshall (in the front row) ,"Guys, four together!",118,9300
9300,2,16,Barney ,I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.,119,9301
9301,2,16,Robin ,Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.,120,9302
9302,2,16,Barney ,No? Okay.,121,9303
9303,2,16,Man 1, I... am... Rage!,122,9304
9304,2,16,Woman ,I... am Greed.,123,9305
9305,2,16,Lily ,I am Rage... Envy!,124,9306
9306,2,16,Barney ,I am outta here.,125,9307
9307,2,16,Marshall ,"No, you're not. You have to stay.",126,9308
9308,2,16,Lily ,This is the face of Consumerism!,127,9309
9309,2,16,Marshall ,"Oh, my God. Ted's part of the play.",128,9310
9310,2,16,Man 2," Hello, Greed, Rage...Envy... and Consumerism. I... am your father... America!",129,9311
9311,2,16,Marshall ,"Oh, baby, that was wonderful!",130,9312
9312,2,16,Ted ,"Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer.",131,9313
9313,2,16,Robin ,"And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, ""Now we are really cookin'!""",132,9314
9314,2,16,Barney ,"Wow, Lily, that sucked!",133,9315
9315,2,16,Marshall ,Barney!,134,9316
9316,2,16,Barney ,"What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends.",135,9317
9317,2,16,Lily ,"No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about.",136,9318
9318,2,16,Barney ,"Yeah, if you're a Smurf.",137,9319
9319,2,16,Lily ,"You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards.",138,9320
9320,2,16,Barney ,"Oh, really? You would?",139,9321
9321,2,16,Lily ,Yes.,140,9322
9322,2,16,Barney ,"Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.",141,9323
9323,2,16,Man ,We'll be starting our Q&A with the director-- yours truly-- in five minutes right here. Barney runs out,142,9324
9324,2,16,Robin ,Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play?,143,9325
9325,2,16,Ted ,I know. He can be really insensitive.,144,9326
9326,2,16,Robin ,"It was pretty bad, though.",145,9327
9327,2,16,Ted ,"Oh, my God, it was so bad.",146,9328
9328,2,16,Robin ,"Oh, my God, you've been robbed!",147,9329
9329,2,16,Ted ,Nope.,148,9330
9330,2,16,Robin ,All that stuff was from old girlfriends? Don't you buy anything for yourself?,149,9331
9331,2,16,Ted ,What can I say? Papa gets swag.,150,9332
9332,2,16,Ted (voix off) ,And that should've been the end of it. But the next day...,151,9333
9333,2,16,Ted ,"You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff. But seeing how happy it makes you - totally worth it.",152,9334
9334,2,16,Robin ,"Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have s*x with you when I'm really tired.",153,9335
9335,2,16,Ted ,"Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Well, sit. Sit, yeah. So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?",154,9336
9336,2,16,Robin ,"Nope. Well, except for my dogs.",155,9337
9337,2,16,Ted ,"So I had to get rid of everything from my past relationships because you don't keep things from your past relationships except, uh, where are your five dogs from? Oh, that's right: your past relationships.",156,9338
9338,2,16,Robin ,"What's your point, Ted?",157,9339
9339,2,16,Ted ,"Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment, and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends?",158,9340
9340,2,16,Robin ,"What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends?",159,9341
9341,2,16,Ted ,I do now.,160,9342
9342,2,16,Robin ,That's ridiculous.,161,9343
9343,2,16,Ted ,"I thought you said you got rid of everything your ex-boyfriends gave you. Well, yeah, but not my dogs.",162,9344
9344,2,16,Ted ,You said everything.,163,9345
9345,2,16,Robin ,But not living things.,164,9346
9346,2,16,Ted ,"Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away.",165,9347
9347,2,16,Robin ,Things with a heartbeat can stay.,166,9348
9348,2,16,Ted ,Enjoying this?,167,9349
9349,2,16,Robin ,"Pickles, go get your ball. Go get your ball.",168,9350
9350,2,16,Ted ,Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you to make me get rid of all my stuff.,169,9351
9351,2,16,Robin ,"Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs?",170,9352
9352,2,16,Man ,Guess what position we did it in.,171,9353
9353,2,16,Ted ,"Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs.",172,9354
9354,2,16,Robin ,"Um, no.",173,9355
9355,2,16,Ted ,"Really? Well, I say we take it to the group, but I don't like your chances.",174,9356
9356,2,16,Marshall ,She's not getting rid of the dogs.,175,9357
9357,2,16,Lily ,What's the matter with you?,176,9358
9358,2,16,Barney ,Even I wouldn't do that.,177,9359
9359,2,16,Robin ,Yes!,178,9360
9360,2,16,Lily ,"You can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair, but not their dog.",179,9361
9361,2,16,Marshall ,I miss Jebediah.,180,9362
9362,2,16,Barney ,"Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play.",181,9363
9363,2,16,Lily ,Very funny.,182,9364
9364,2,16,Barney ,"Oh, it's not a joke. It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night. And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long, I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends.",183,9365
9365,2,16,Lily ,"Oh, we'll be there.",184,9366
9366,2,16,Barney ,"Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong...",185,9367
9367,2,16,Lily ,Never.,186,9368
9368,2,16,Barney ,"Good. Okay, I gotta go rehearse. Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho; the first three rows get wet.",187,9369
9369,2,16,Robin ,I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from.,188,9370
9370,2,16,Ted ,I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them. That was ridiculous.,189,9371
9371,2,16,Robin ,So we're-we're okay?,190,9372
9372,2,16,Ted ,"Yeah, we're great.",191,9373
9373,2,16,Ted (voix off) ,"And I thought we were, but just as it did in the seventh act of Aunt Lily's play, Jealousy reared its ugly head.",192,9374
9374,2,16,Man ,"Oh, yeah, that's the spot.",193,9375
9375,2,16,Man ,"Dude, I gotta pee.",194,9376
9376,2,16,Ted ,I gotta go.,195,9377
9377,2,16,Lily ,"Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh?",196,9378
9378,2,16,Robin ,"Yeah, he really is. It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs. Might be time to send them to the farm.",197,9379
9379,2,16,Lily ,You're gonna k*ll your dogs?!,198,9380
9380,2,16,Robin ,"No! No, no, no, there really is a farm. My aunt has a farm upstate.",199,9381
9381,2,16,Lily ,"Oh, thank God. Aw, you know, if I were five dogs, I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn.",200,9382
9382,2,16,Robin ,"Yeah. I could visit them on weekends. My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty.",201,9383
9383,2,16,Lily ,"Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs.",202,9384
9384,2,16,Robin ,"""They""? What do you mean by ""they""?",203,9385
9385,2,16,Lily ,"Uh... uh.... uh... People upstate. Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!",204,9386
9386,2,16,Marshall ,"Are you sure you're gonna be okay? I mean, you know that this is gonna be...",205,9387
9387,2,16,Lily ,"I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do.",206,9388
9388,2,16,Barney ,Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.,207,9389
9389,2,16,Ted (voix off) ,That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.,208,9390
9390,2,16,Barney ,Moist.,209,9391
9391,2,16,Ted (voix off) ,And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.,210,9392
9392,2,16,Barney ,I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over.,211,9393
9393,2,16,Marshall ,I never get picked for audience participation.,212,9394
9394,2,16,Ted (voix off) ,And then it just got weird.,213,9395
9395,2,16,Barney ,"Feelings. Inside. Oh, no!",214,9396
9396,2,16,Ted (voix off) ,And when that didn't work...,215,9397
9397,2,16,Lily ,"Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show.",216,9398
9398,2,16,Barney ,"Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?",217,9399
9399,2,16,Lily ,"No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar.",218,9400
9400,2,16,Barney ,"Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting",219,9401
9401,2,16,Lily ,"Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go.",220,9402
9402,2,16,Barney ,Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.,221,9403
9403,2,16,Lily ,"Yeah, well, anyway.",222,9404
9404,2,16,Barney ,"Act two is where I really hit my stride. Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love. Lily: How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show?",223,9405
9405,2,16,Barney ,"It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two.",224,9406
9406,2,16,Ted (voix off) ,"So we stayed and let Barney torture us for another hour and a half, 'cause that's what friends do, apparently.",225,9407
9407,2,16,Robin ,Hey.,226,9408
9408,2,16,Ted ,Where've you been? I called you earlier.,227,9409
9409,2,16,Robin ,I gave my dogs away to my aunt.,228,9410
9410,2,16,Ted ,You what?,229,9411
9411,2,16,Robin ,"Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but... I think it's for the best.",230,9412
9412,2,16,Ted ,"Wow. Oh, man.",231,9413
9413,2,16,Robin ,Can we go inside?,232,9414
9414,2,16,Ted ,"Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar.",233,9415
9415,2,16,Robin ,Why? What's going on inside?,234,9416
9416,2,16,Ted ,"Um, the floors are gone.",235,9417
9417,2,16,Robin ,What?,236,9418
9418,2,16,Ted ,"Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed. This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail.",237,9419
9419,2,16,Ted ,I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!,238,9420
9420,2,16,Robin ,You said you threw all that stuff away!,239,9421
9421,2,16,Ted (voix off) ,"Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had. It was one of those fights that last for hours and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about. We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window. Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy. But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me, but somehow we got to here.",240,9422
9422,2,16,Robin ,We're really doing this?,241,9423
9423,2,16,Ted ,Yeah.,242,9424
9424,2,16,Ted and Robin, We're moving in together!,243,9425
9425,2,16,Barney ,"The robot found love Confusing my circuitry My software's been hacked Toaster oven You're the one for me Two, three, four.",244,9426
9426,2,16,Marshall ,That's two.,245,9427
9427,2,17,Ted ,This is awesome.,1,9428
9428,2,17,Marshall ,"I can't believe this moment's finally here. One more mile and my little boy turns 200,000.",2,9429
9429,2,17,Ted ,"Your baby Fiero's grown into a really old man Fiero. And just like an old man, he leaks fluid, smells stale, makes weird noises out the back.",3,9430
9430,2,17,Marshall ,"Yeah, he does. Hey, light up those cigars in the glove compartment. They're real Cubans. I got 'em in Chinatown last year just for this moment.",4,9431
9431,2,17,Ted ,"Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off, but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins.",5,9432
9432,2,17,Marshal ,What are you talking about?,6,9433
9433,2,17,Ted ,"Whoa, pothole. The car stops.",7,9434
9434,2,17,Marshall ,"What? No. Oh. No. No, no, no. No, there's only.8 miles to go. Come on, buddy. Buddy!",8,9435
9435,2,17,Ted ,Is it cool if I still light these?,9,9436
9436,2,17,Ted (voix off) ,"Kids, sometimes life forces us to be someone we didn't want to be. When that happens, we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were. Maybe a tattoo. Or a piece of jewelry. A tiny souvenir that reminds us, ""This is who I really am."" Marshall's souvenir was not so tiny, but the more he found himself being pushed toward the corporate world and away from his dream of saving the environment, the tighter he held on to that Fiero.",10,9437
9437,2,17,Ted ,Hey. One good thing: we're off the hook for the folding party today.,11,9438
9438,2,17,Marshall ,Hey. It's very important to both Lily and me that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our wedding's... I couldn't even get through it. Thank God.,12,9439
9439,2,17,Ted ,"Hey, your car's going to be fine. This is the best auto shop around. Look at this certificate. One of the mechanics here finished a 64-ounce steak.",13,9440
9440,2,17,Lily ,Surprise.,14,9441
9441,2,17,Robin ,"We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here.",15,9442
9442,2,17,Barney ,We insisted.,16,9443
9443,2,17,Ted ,Terrific.,17,9444
9444,2,17,Barney ,How's the Fiero?,18,9445
9445,2,17,Marshall ,She's still in triage.,19,9446
9446,2,17,Ted ,She? I thought it was your little boy.,20,9447
9447,2,17,Lily ,"Oh, it goes back and forth. It's sort of a tr*nny car.",21,9448
9448,2,17,Robin ,How long have you had her... slash him?,22,9449
9449,2,17,Marshall ,My brothers handed it down to me when I was 16.,23,9450
9450,2,17,Robin ,"Oh, how nice of them.",24,9451
9451,2,17,Marshall ,Not really.,25,9452
9452,2,17,Brother 1, Congratulations.,26,9453
9453,2,17,Brother 2, The Fiero is yours. If you pass the final test.,27,9454
9454,2,17,Marshall ,Come on! I already shaved my legs and swallowed five dollars in quarters. Only $4.50 has come out.,28,9455
9455,2,17,Brother 1, Just go to the Weinerburger drive-thru and get us 12 cups of coffee.,29,9456
9456,2,17,Marshall ,That's it?,30,9457
9457,2,17,Brother 2," Oh, yeah. But we get to decide what you wear.",31,9458
9458,2,17,Marshall ,Agreed. Totally agreed.,32,9459
9459,2,17,Man ,You're naked.,33,9460
9460,2,17,Marshall ,I'm aware of that.,34,9461
9461,2,17,Man ,You have 50 cents?,35,9462
9462,2,17,Marshall ,"No... Look, can I just have my coffee, please?",36,9463
9463,2,17,Man ,"Sorry, we're all out of trays and lids. Two tall guys just came through here a few minutes ago and bought 'em all.",37,9464
9464,2,17,Ted ,"And that is the origin of Marshall's insane ""no food or drinks in the Fiero, not even groceries"" rule.",38,9465
9465,2,17,Marshall ,It is not insane.,39,9466
9466,2,17,Lily ,Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.,40,9467
9467,2,17,Barney ,"Well, I'm trying, but it's...",41,9468
9468,2,17,Lily ,"Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?",42,9469
9469,2,17,Barney ,"Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it.",43,9470
9470,2,17,Lily ,No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out.,44,9471
9471,2,17,Barney ,"Aw, nerts.",45,9472
9472,2,17,Ted ,The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it. Remember the 100K fiasco?,46,9473
9473,2,17,Marshall ,"Ah, the Fiero-asco.",47,9474
9474,2,17,Ted ,"Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco.",48,9475
9475,2,17,Robin ,What's the 100K fiasco?,49,9476
9476,2,17,Marshall ,The Fiero-asco?,50,9477
9477,2,17,Ted ,"It was just before winter break our freshman year of college. Marshall and I were roommates, but we weren't really good friends yet.",51,9478
9478,2,17,Marshall ,I thought Ted was a little bit pretentious.,52,9479
9479,2,17,Ted ,And Marshall was a total slob.,53,9480
9480,2,17,Marshall ,"Hey (Marshall throws a sandwich in the trash but misses it) I'm driving my Fiero back over break. I know we see enough of each other as it is, but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money. You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up.",54,9481
9481,2,17,Ted ,"All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio. I live in the moment. Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving. We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so...",55,9482
9482,2,17,Marshall ,"All right, well, call me if you change your mind. My odometer's going to hit 100K.",56,9483
9483,2,17,Ted ,She'd be so bummed if I left early.,57,9484
9484,2,17,Ted ,"It was totally mutual. I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I... it was... it was totally mutual.",58,9485
9485,2,17,Marshall ,I hear you.,59,9486
9486,2,17,Ted ,So what's up with you and Lily? Anything serious,60,9487
9487,2,17,Marshall ,"Yeah. Dude, we're college freshmen. I'm not going to get tied down by the first chick I hook up with. Lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know?",61,9488
9488,2,17,,Ted(voix off): The next few hours of our drive were classic road trip.,62,9489
9489,2,17,Ted ,So... this song.,63,9490
9490,2,17,Marshall ,"Oh, it's the best song in the world. It's the only song I like. Just kidding. Tape's been stuck in the player for, like, two years. Better than nothing, though.",64,9491
9491,2,17,Ted ,Maybe. I am so... sick... of this song.,65,9492
9492,2,17,Marshall ,Don't worry. It comes around again.,66,9493
9493,2,17,Ted ,What do you mean?,67,9494
9494,2,17,,"Ted and Marshall singing: Just to be the man who walks 1,000 miles And falls down at your door...",68,9495
9495,2,17,Marshall ,"Yeah, we totally nailed the ending.",69,9496
9496,2,17,Ted ,"That was probably our best one. Hey, you want to play Zitch Dog?",70,9497
9497,2,17,Marshall ,What?,71,9498
9498,2,17,Ted ,"Uh, it's a car game. Every time you see a dog, you got to be the first one to say, ""Zitch dog."" I'm pretty good, so...",72,9499
9499,2,17,Marshall ,Zitch dog.,73,9500
9500,2,17,Ted ,"Well, no, I didn't know we had...we'd started, but... Okay, that's cool. You got the first point.",74,9501
9501,2,17,Marshall ,Zitch dog.,75,9502
9502,2,17,Ted ,Zitch dog. Damn it!,76,9503
9503,2,17,Ted ,Are we still playing? 'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...,77,9504
9504,2,17,Marshall ,12-nothing.,78,9505
9505,2,17,Ted ,Marshall. Marshall.,79,9506
9506,2,17,Marshall ,"Zitch dog, blue Suburban.",80,9507
9507,2,17,Ted ,Damn it!,81,9508
9508,2,17,Marshall ,18-nothing.,82,9509
9509,2,17,Ted (voix off) ,"Then Marshall, who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog, got us totally lost.",83,9510
9510,2,17,Marshall ,Where the hell are we?!,84,9511
9511,2,17,Marshall ,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I think you skipped something.",85,9512
9512,2,17,Barney ,Really? Seems impossible.,86,9513
9513,2,17,Ted ,"Hey, we got some time. What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know? Robert Frost.",87,9514
9514,2,17,Marshall ,Doesn't seem like a smart idea.,88,9515
9515,2,17,Ted ,"Too late. I'm taking this exit. Who's not fun enough now, Karen?",89,9516
9516,2,17,Marshall ,Then we got lost. Where the hell are we?! I'm pulling over.,90,9517
9517,2,17,Ted ,"No, keep driving.",91,9518
9518,2,17,Marshall ,"We're almost out of gas, and we might not even be on a road anymore.",92,9519
9519,2,17,Ted ,"It's below zero out. If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days. Plus, I only have, like, six granola bars and three bottles of water.",93,9520
9520,2,17,Marshall ,"Nah, I threw them out.",94,9521
9521,2,17,Ted ,What?!,95,9522
9522,2,17,Marshall ,No food or drink in the Fiero.,96,9523
9523,2,17,Ted ,No food or drink in the F...? You haven't washed your sheets since... (Voix off): Thus began the longest night of our lives.,97,9524
9524,2,17,Marshall ,Pretty sure that my foot is frozen solid.,98,9525
9525,2,17,Ted ,"Marshall... there's a very real chance that we're gonna be snowed in here for days. If I die first, do whatever you need to survive. Eat my flesh. Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever.",99,9526
9526,2,17,Marshall ,"Thanks, Ted. You're a good friend. And if I die first, you just leave my body alone.",100,9527
9527,2,17,Ted ,What? I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me.,101,9528
9528,2,17,Marshall ,"Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me; it skeeves me out.",102,9529
9529,2,17,Ted ,"But... but you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't.",103,9530
9530,2,17,Marshall ,Wasn't an easy decision.,104,9531
9531,2,17,Ted ,This is all because of your insane no-food rule.,105,9532
9532,2,17,Marshall ,It's perfectly rational.,106,9533
9533,2,17,Ted ,"Hey! My spectacles! Hey. I know we're low on gas, but can we turn on the heat for just a minute?",107,9534
9534,2,17,Marshall ,Okay. Dude... I hate to say this... but it's so cold... there's only one way that we're gonna make it through this night.(they're both in the back seat in each other arms) We should've kept driving.,108,9535
9535,2,17,Ted ,"Come on, Marshall.",109,9536
9536,2,17,Marshall ,"No. No. We might die now. I may never see Lily again. I never told anybody this, but... I've known for a long time that I'm gonna marry that girl. If we survive this, someday I'm gonna marry her. I'm sorry about your spectacles.",110,9537
9537,2,17,Ted ,"That's okay. They were decorative. Hey, Marshall.",111,9538
9538,2,17,Marshall ,Yeah?,112,9539
9539,2,17,Ted ,Are you still thinking about Lily?,113,9540
9540,2,17,Marshall ,Yeah.,114,9541
9541,2,17,Ted ,Please stop.(voix off) And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere. But funny thing...,115,9542
9542,2,17,Man ,Hey. You lovers better just keep on driving.,116,9543
9543,2,17,Marshall ,Zitch dog!,117,9544
9544,2,17,Ted ,Damn it!,118,9545
9545,2,17,Lily ,You said you were gonna marry me that long ago? That is so sweet.,119,9546
9546,2,17,Ted ,That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends.,120,9547
9547,2,17,Barney ,"With privileges, from the sound of it.",121,9548
9548,2,17,Mechanic ,Eriksen. (Marshall follows the mechanic),122,9549
9549,2,17,Barney ,Wow. Looks like he really needs a hug. Ted.,123,9550
9550,2,17,Marshall ,"He said it would be at least 3,000 bucks to make it run again. And even then, there's no guarantee.",124,9551
9551,2,17,Ted ,"Well, it's a pretty old car.",125,9552
9552,2,17,Robin ,"Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life, but it's really mostly machine at this point.",126,9553
9553,2,17,Marshall ,"I know that it's a lot of money, but it's my Fiero, you know? I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job, and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit.",127,9554
9554,2,17,Barney ,How dare you...,128,9555
9555,2,17,Robibn ,Hey.,129,9556
9556,2,17,Marshall ,I've been through so much in that car. The suicidal cat.,130,9557
9557,2,17,Marshall ,Hitchhiking Waldo. (a guy is sitting between Barney and Marshall in the car)The homeless guy who broke in through the window and threw up all over the backseat.,131,9558
9558,2,17,Robin ,"Lily, don't. Be strong. Do not go all ""prisoner's dilemma"" on me.",132,9559
9559,2,17,Lily ,"The car's on its deathbed, Robin. I have to clear my conscience.",133,9560
9560,2,17,Marshall ,"Guys, what are you talking about?",134,9561
9561,2,17,Lily ,"Okay. Shortly after we met Robin, she and I were jonesing for Thai food from this one place.",135,9562
9562,2,17,Robin ,An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long.,136,9563
9563,2,17,Lily ,"I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule.",137,9564
9564,2,17,Robin ,"But Thai food, Lily. Pad Yum Mao. Tom Kai Gah. Thai See Ran.",138,9565
9565,2,17,Lily ,"Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious. Okay. Here's what we'll do. We'll drive over, pick it up, have them double-bag it, very carefully drive it back here with the windows open, and he'll never know. (Lily slows down the car and knock down the food). Wow, these brakes are really sensitive. Oh, Marshall is gonna k*ll me! This and the difference between ""affect"" and ""effect"" are the only two things he's really serious about.",139,9566
9566,2,17,Robin ,"Lily, it's gonna be fine.",140,9567
9567,2,17,Lily ,"No, it's not. Marshall's gonna freak. Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do? Oh, God, oh...!",141,9568
9568,2,17,Robin ,"Shut up! Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking. Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage. Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts-- the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up. Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai. You mentioned cigars.",142,9569
9569,2,17,Lily ,"There's two in the glove compartment, but he's been saving them.",143,9570
9570,2,17,Robin ,"Hand me those chopsticks. Hey, how about some tunes? Oh, great song.",144,9571
9571,2,17,Lily ,These cigars aren't helping at all.,145,9572
9572,2,17,Robin ,Yeah. This was a terrible idea.,146,9573
9573,2,17,Lily ,Now it just smells like a homeless guy threw up in here. End of flasback.,147,9574
9574,2,17,Marshall ,The broken windows?,148,9575
9575,2,17,Lily ,We had to make it look realistic.,149,9576
9576,2,17,Marshall ,Why did you break two of them?,150,9577
9577,2,17,Robin ,It looked like fun when she did it. So I wanted to try.,151,9578
9578,2,17,Marshall ,Can't believe this whole time it was you guys. I've been blaming really tanned dancing leotard guy.,152,9579
9579,2,17,Lily ,"Marshall, I'm so sorry, but sharing that secret-- that's when Robin and I became best friends.",153,9580
9580,2,17,Mechanic ,"Wow. What a special car. So, can I crush it into a little cube yet?",154,9581
9581,2,17,Marshall ,I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.,155,9582
9582,2,17,Barney ,"Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here.",156,9583
9583,2,17,Robin ,"Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?",157,9584
9584,2,17,Barney ,Love it? Hold on a second. Love it? I hate it!,158,9585
9585,2,17,Lily ,What? Why?,159,9586
9586,2,17,Barney ,Why? Why? Why?! Why?!,160,9587
9587,2,17,Ted ,Let me tell it. It was last year during the transit strike.,161,9588
9588,2,17,Ted ,Hey.,162,9589
9589,2,17,Barney ,"Hey. Uh, is Marshall around? I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride.",163,9590
9590,2,17,Ted ,"Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys.",164,9591
9591,2,17,Barney ,Hey! Why don't you drive me? It'll be like a total road trip.,165,9592
9592,2,17,Ted ,To Queens?,166,9593
9593,2,17,Barney ,"Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.",167,9594
9594,2,17,,"Ted:Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so.",168,9595
9595,2,17,Barney ,"Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel. See you later.",169,9596
9596,2,17,Ted ,"Wait! You know how to drive, right?",170,9597
9597,2,17,Barney ,"What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving. Hitting the road. Cruising the lanes. And braking. Honking. Love it. Except for lady drivers. Don't get me started on lady drivers.",171,9598
9598,2,17,Ted ,Which pedal's the gas?,172,9599
9599,2,17,Barney ,Trick question.,173,9600
9600,2,17,Ted ,"No, it's not",174,9601
9601,2,17,Barney ,"Yes, it is.",175,9602
9602,2,17,Ted ,"No, it's not.",176,9603
9603,2,17,Barney ,"Middle, left, right? I never learned how to drive! I grew up in the city. I never had a chance.",177,9604
9604,2,17,Ted ,"Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up.",178,9605
9605,2,17,Barney ,This isn't right. God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds.,179,9606
9606,2,17,Ted ,Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.,180,9607
9607,2,17,Barney ,"Dude, a dog.",181,9608
9608,2,17,Ted ,"Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.",182,9609
9609,2,17,Barney ,"What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted.",183,9610
9610,2,17,Ted ,Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.,184,9611
9611,2,17,Barney ,Which? Which one's the break again?,185,9612
9612,2,17,Ted ,The left one.,186,9613
9613,2,17,Barney ,"Left. Oh, man, left. I'm totally blanking.",187,9614
9614,2,17,Ted ,Make the Ls,188,9615
9615,2,17,,".Barney: Oh, we're not going to make it.",189,9616
9616,2,17,Ted ,Why did you just turn on the radio?,190,9617
9617,2,17,Barney ,"I don't know why I turned on the radio! We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted.",191,9618
9618,2,17,Ted ,Relax. You're being crazy.,192,9619
9619,2,17,Barney ,"Help me, Ted! I'm being serious.",193,9620
9620,2,17,Ted ,"Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!",194,9621
9621,2,17,Barney ,I can't move. I can't... I can't feel my... Wait. Wait. We're okay.,195,9622
9622,2,17,Ted ,We're okay.,196,9623
9623,2,17,Barney ,"We're okay. It's a miracle, Ted!",197,9624
9624,2,17,Robin ,Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car.,198,9625
9625,2,17,Ted ,"Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he...",199,9626
9626,2,17,Barney ,"ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina hummina. I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap. But fate... fate gave me a second chance. And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander. So I decided from that moment on to continue living life to its fullest.",200,9627
9627,2,17,Lily ,So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all.,201,9628
9628,2,17,Barney ,True story.,202,9629
9629,2,17,Marshall ,Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it.,203,9630
9630,2,17,Barney ,Yes!,204,9631
9631,2,17,Ted and Robin, What?,205,9632
9632,2,17,Marshall ,"It's lived a great life and it deserves to die with dignity.Ted: But 200,000...",206,9633
9633,2,17,Marshall ,"But that's life. You know? You never end up where you thought you wanted to be. I'm not helping the environment. Ted's not a philosopher. Lily's not not a world-famous artist. Barney's never driven more than ten miles an hour. Robin, I'm sure, has also experience disappointment in her life. Maybe? And my Fiero's not a Fiero that went 200,000 miles. It's okay. You know? Those are old dreams. We'll get a new car and we'll fill that one up with new memories. And that'll be the car we had when we were first married. When we owned our first house. Maybe even the first car our four kids remember.",207,9634
9634,2,17,Lily ,That's so sweet. The first car our two kids remember.,208,9635
9635,2,17,Marshall ,I would like to say good-bye. Marshall is in the car and the other are around it. Marshall taps the dashboard and the cassette goes out.,209,9636
9636,2,17,Ted ,"You know what? This Fiero, it's effected all our lives.",210,9637
9637,2,17,Marshall ,Affected.,211,9638
9638,2,17,Ted ,That's what I said.,212,9639
9639,2,17,Marshall ,"Just making sure. Got us all a lot of places. I mean maybe it's time we return the favor. This Fiero should have made it to 200,000. So, let's get it out that door. And we'll push it the last.7 miles. It'd do the same for us. Marshall puts the cassette back in and they all start to push.",213,9640
9640,2,17,Maechanic ,"Hey, geniuses. The back wheels are on blocks. That car ain't going anywhere.",214,9641
9641,2,17,Marshall ,Close enough!,215,9642
9642,2,17,All ,Close enough!,216,9643
9643,2,17,Ted (voix off) ,"And so Marshall said good-bye to his Fiero. And as the car's final gift to us all, the money he got for scrap parts paid our bar tab for the next two nights.",217,9644
9644,2,17,Marshall ,"Arrivederci, Fiero! You were the freaking giving tree of cars.Lily: May you rust in peace.",218,9645
9645,2,17,Barney ,"Rot in hell, devil steed.",219,9646
9646,2,17,Ted (voix off) ,And what better friend is there than that?,220,9647
9647,2,17,Marshall ,Bro. Have you heard this new song? I just got the cassingle.,221,9648
9648,2,17,Brother ,Put it in.,222,9649
9649,2,17,Marshall ,"I am never going to get sick of this song. Never, ever, never, never, ever. Yeah!",223,9650
9650,2,20,,"Ted (2030): When the marriage approched, some weird stuff started happening.",1,9651
9651,2,20,Lily ,Why does my stomach hurt?,2,9652
9652,2,20,Marshall ,"I'm sorry, baby. I ate a bunch of ice cream earlier today.",3,9653
9653,2,20,Lily ,"Oh, baby, you know we're lactose-intolerant.",4,9654
9654,2,20,Tes ,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you suggesting that when one of you feels something, the other feels it, too? Oh, God, you guys are so codependent.",5,9655
9655,2,20,Lily ,"No, we're not.",6,9656
9656,2,20,Ted ,"Oh, really? What about the other day?",7,9657
9657,2,20,Lily ,"Oh, I need to get some eggs.",8,9658
9658,2,20,Marshall ,"Oh, I'll come with you.",9,9659
9659,2,20,Marshall ,Just because we like spending time together doesn't mean we're codependent.,10,9660
9660,2,20,Barney ,Really? Then whatever happened to your plan of spending the last two weeks before your wedding sleeping apart?,11,9661
9661,2,20,Marshall ,"Okay, we decided not to do that because of...",12,9662
9662,2,20,Lily ,Logistics. Wedding logistics.,13,9663
9663,2,20,Marshall ,"Frickin' logistics, man. They mess everything up.",14,9664
9664,2,20,Ted ,You didn't do it because you couldn't do it.,15,9665
9665,2,20,Marshall ,Sure we could.,16,9666
9666,2,20,Robin ,Then why don't you? You can stay with me.,17,9667
9667,2,20,Lily ,It would make our wedding night more special.,18,9668
9668,2,20,Marshall ,"Okay, let's do it.",19,9669
9669,2,20,Lily ,Done.,20,9670
9670,2,20,Marshall ,I'm gonna go grab a beer.,21,9671
9671,2,20,Lily ,I'll come with you. No. I'll stay.,22,9672
9672,2,20,Lily ,"Okay, I know. You know? I got to go. Good-bye. My mom's driving me cra....",23,9673
9673,2,20,Ted ,Long story. I'll tell you later.,24,9674
9674,2,20,Barney ,"Yeah. It's a dirty story, isn't it? You guys went out to dinner, did it in the kitchen and got caught. Scherbatsky reeks of someone who likes to get caught.",25,9675
9675,2,20,Robin ,"Okay, now I have to wash up for two reasons.",26,9676
9676,2,20,Marshall ,"Oh, you didn't. That's right.",27,9677
9677,2,20,Barney ,So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart?,28,9678
9678,2,20,Marshall ,"You know what, Barney? Lily and I are a lot less chees than you make us out to be.",29,9679
9679,2,20,Lily ,"Marshmallow, don't forget to pack my night-night tape.",30,9680
9680,2,20,Barney ,"Night-night tape? Did you make a tape of you saying ""night-night"" to her?",31,9681
9681,2,20,Marshall ,No.,32,9682
9682,2,20,Lily ,He doesn't say it. He sings it.,33,9683
9683,2,20,Barney ,"Oh, that is so sweet. Why don't you kiss? I love it when two chicks make out.",34,9684
9684,2,20,Lily ,Damn it. Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.,35,9685
9685,2,20,Barney ,What's on there?,36,9686
9686,2,20,Lily ,"Ooh, lots of stuff. Kitchen Aide Artisan Series tilt-head stand mixer...",37,9687
9687,2,20,Barney ,Retail price $319.99. What else?,38,9688
9688,2,20,Lily ,"Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum.",39,9689
9689,2,20,Barney ,"Ah, $549.99. A little greedy, don't you think?",40,9690
9690,2,20,Marshall ,Did you memorize our registry?,41,9691
9691,2,20,Barney ,"No, I'm training.",42,9692
9692,2,20,Marshall ,Training? For what?,43,9693
9693,2,20,Barney ,"I'm glad you asked. Ted, Robin, get in here! You guys know how it's hard to be friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?",44,9694
9694,2,20,Ted ,"Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on.",45,9695
9695,2,20,Barney ,"Well, this isn't going to make it any easier. I am going to be on... The Price Is Right.",46,9696
9696,2,20,Marshall ,No way!,47,9697
9697,2,20,Ted ,What?!,48,9698
9698,2,20,Barney ,"Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields is going to call out my name, and I will come on down.",49,9699
9699,2,20,Marshall ,"Whoa, that is so awesome.",50,9700
9700,2,20,Robin ,"Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right.",51,9701
9701,2,20,Barney ,"Are you kidding? T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television, it's a microcosm of our entire economic system-- a capitalist utopia, where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit. I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right, and I see the face of America. And it is divine. Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars.",52,9702
9702,2,20,,Ted (2030): Then Lily headed out to Robin's for her first night away from Marshall.,53,9703
9703,2,20,Lily ,I'm ready! Lily comes into the livingroom with her wedding dress while Robin singins.),54,9704
9704,2,20,Robin ,"Ta-da-da-da-da... Wow, Lily, you look so beautiful.",55,9705
9705,2,20,Lily ,I know! I'm beautiful! I'm a fairy princess! (she raises her arms and the dress falls.) I'm too skinny for my dress!,56,9706
9706,2,20,,"Ted(2030): Meanwhile, I was testing out my best man toast on Marshall.",57,9707
9707,2,20,Ted ,"Here goes. Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Strong opening, right?",58,9708
9708,2,20,Marshall ,That's fantastic.,59,9709
9709,2,20,Ted ,"When Marshall graduates this spring, he'll be a lawyer. But did you know that Marshall has a criminal record? That's right, on a road trip up to Cape Cod, Marshall was pulled over for driving by himself in a car pool lane.",60,9710
9710,2,20,Marshall ,"Oh, crap.",61,9711
9711,2,20,Lily ,"Oh, crap.",62,9712
9712,2,20,Marshall ,"Are you crazy? You cannot tell that story at my wedding. My entire family's gonna be there. My little cousins, my mom, my grandma, my grandpa the minister.",63,9713
9713,2,20,Ted ,That grandpa died three years ago.,64,9714
9714,2,20,Marshall ,"His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted. I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance.",65,9715
9715,2,20,Barney ,"So which one, ""A"" or ""B""?",66,9716
9716,2,20,Marshall ,What was that?,67,9717
9717,2,20,Barney ,"I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, ""Barney Stinson, come on down!""",68,9718
9718,2,20,Ted ,"Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?",69,9719
9719,2,20,Barney ,"Yeah, of course.",70,9720
9720,2,20,Barney ,"Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.",71,9721
9721,2,20,Lily ,"It's $300 just to take the bust in? Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me. I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress. I lost all this weight without even trying. Hello?",72,9722
9722,2,20,Robin ,What happened?,73,9723
9723,2,20,Lily ,"She called me a bitch and hung up. Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just have to pay the $300.",74,9724
9724,2,20,Robin ,"Pay the $300? Lily, are you crazy? This isn't a problem. It's a license to eat. Look, what have you always wanted to eat but didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?",75,9725
9725,2,20,Lily ,"Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate soufflée with a raspberry brandy sauce topped with caramelized bananas and hazelnut gelato.",76,9726
9726,2,20,Robin ,I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos.,77,9727
9727,2,20,Lily ,Done!,78,9728
9728,2,20,Ted ,"Okay, think you're gonna be happy with my new toast. There's nothing sexual. It's, uh, it's just the story of an important moment in your relationship.",79,9729
9729,2,20,Marshall ,"I'm all ears. Hello, everyone,",80,9730
9730,2,20,Ted ,"I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.",81,9731
9731,2,20,Marshall ,Nice.,82,9732
9732,2,20,Ted ,"Right? That's great. Back when we were all freshman and Marshall and Lily were just a few short weeks into their relationship... It was 4:00 in the morning, and I'm not gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted. We were starving. So I'd gone out to get us some snacks, and when I got back...",83,9733
9733,2,20,Marshall ,I love you.,84,9734
9734,2,20,Lily ,"I love you, too. I know it's soon to say it, but I'm so glad you did.",85,9735
9735,2,20,Marshall ,Yeah. Ted leaves the room.,86,9736
9736,2,20,Marshall ,"So here's what you want to talk about in front of my entire family: drinking, having a girl in my room, eating junk food.",87,9737
9737,2,20,Ted ,"Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food?",88,9738
9738,2,20,Marshall ,"Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's not important. Also, so Lily's never heard that story before. How's she going to react when she finds out the first time I said ""I love you"" to her, I was actually saying it to you and a bag of Funyuns",89,9739
9739,2,20,Ted ,"But who cares? You did love her. And you still do. And you're totally over Funyuns, so it's not weird.",90,9740
9740,2,20,Marshall ,"Hey, Lil.",91,9741
9741,2,20,Lily ,Hey.,92,9742
9742,2,20,Ted ,Hey? That's it?,93,9743
9743,2,20,Marshall ,What are you talking about?,94,9744
9744,2,20,Ted ,"Well, you guys have been spending the last few nights apart. I figured there'd be a lot of giggling, crying, jumping up and down, and then whatever Lily would do",95,9745
9745,2,20,,"Ted (2030): Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.",96,9746
9746,2,20,Barney ,"Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready? (he turnst he wheel)",97,9747
9747,2,20,Marshall ,"Oh, wow, that was pretty close.",98,9748
9748,2,20,Barney ,"Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined!",99,9749
9749,2,20,Ted ,"What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?",100,9750
9750,2,20,Barney ,"Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father.",101,9751
9751,2,20,Ted ,Your father?,102,9752
9752,2,20,Barney ,That's right. My father... is Bob Barker.,103,9753

9758,2,20,Bareney ,"Yes, Robin?",109,9759
9759,2,20,Robin ,Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?,110,9760
9760,2,20,Barney ,"Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.",111,9761
9761,2,20,Barney ,"Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?",112,9762
9762,2,20,Barney's mom," Oh, I don't know. That guy. (she shows him Bob Barker on TV)",113,9763

9765,2,20,Barney (throwing a ball at the TV) ,"Want to play some catch, Pop?",116,9766
9766,2,20,Barney ,"So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am.",117,9767
9767,2,20,Ted ,You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?,118,9768
9768,2,20,Barney ,Why is this so hard for you people to believe?,119,9769
9769,2,20,Robin ,"Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there.",120,9770
9770,2,20,Lily ,This is the best wedding diet ever.,121,9771
9771,2,20,Lily ,I lost a pound.,122,9772
9772,2,20,Robin ,That is impossible. You ate McDonald's every meal for three days.,123,9773
9773,2,20,Lily ,I knew that Super Size Me guy was full of it.,124,9774
9774,2,20,Robin ,"Well, it must be the wedding stress. We just got to up the intake. Lily Aldrin, drop and give me 20 bites of fudge! Okay? Don't nibble at it. Attack it! Come on, Lily. You can do better than that!",125,9775
9775,2,20,Lily ,I can't.,126,9776

9782,2,20,Ted ,"Yeah. Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.",133,9783
9783,2,20,Marshall ,"Still strong, right?",134,9784
9784,2,20,Ted ,"Great, yeah. I'd like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall",135,9785
9785,2,20,Ted ,"when Marshall and Lily got back together. Afterward, we stayed up till 10:00 at night, doing shots of chocolate milk.",136,9786

9789,2,20,Marshall ,"Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents for teaching me good values.",140,9790
9790,2,20,Ted ,"Now, I wasn't supposed to hear this next part, but Marshall leaned over to Lily and whispered.",141,9791
9791,2,20,Marshall ,You know what I'd like to do to you right now? I'd like to hold your hand. I'd like to hold your hand so hard that you're not able to shake hands for a week.,142,9792
9792,2,20,Lily ,Are you just going to talk about holding my hand or are you going to hold it?,143,9793
9793,2,20,Ted ,"Then a little later, Robin caught them... Oh, um......holding hands. End flashback. It was a lovely and responsible night. To Marshall and Lily.",144,9794
9794,2,20,Marshall ,"That's the worst toast I've ever heard, dude. It's totally boring.",145,9795
9795,2,20,Ted ,"Exactly. It's impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me, man. I give up. I'm just going to read that thing about Jesus and the footprints.",146,9796
9796,2,20,Lily ,"I give up, too. I don't care if my dress doesn't fit. I can't eat anymore. I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode.",147,9797
9797,2,20,Marshall ,I know.,148,9798
9798,2,20,Ted ,"And so, Lily and I were both about to give up, but as you can all see, Lily does look beautiful in that dress, and here I am giving a toast. You know, all this time, I'd been wracking my brain trying to pick out the perfect moment to capture Lily and Marshall as a couple. But then I realized the perfect moment wasn't some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together. The perfect Lily and Marshall moment happened two nights ago.",149,9799
9799,2,20,Ted ,"Marshall, what are you doing?",150,9800

9807,2,20,Lily ,"God, I missed you.",158,9808
9808,2,20,Marshall ,"I can't sleep without you. Hey, baby? Would you be the big spoon for a while?",159,9809
9809,2,20,Lily ,"Sure, baby.",160,9810
9810,2,20,Marshall ,How's the weight gaining going?,161,9811

9812,2,20,Marshall ,"Well, I'm here now.",163,9813
9813,2,20,,"Ted(giving the toast): And so Lily and Marshall failed in their experiment with apartness, but they succeeded in getting Lily into her dress. You know, there really are a million things I could tell you about Lily and Marshall, but really, the only thing you need to know is that ten years into their relationship, they still couldn't spend a single night apart. May they never have to again. To Lily and Marshall.",164,9814

9889,2,21,Lily ,"So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle.",4,9890
9890,2,21,Barney ,And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.,5,9891
9891,2,21,Robin ,But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?,6,9892
9892,2,21,Barney ,"Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, ""I do."" Yeah.",7,9893
9893,2,21,,"Ted (2030): The closer you get to the big day, the more concessions you make.",8,9894
9894,2,21,Lily ,Great. Now my mom's making me invite the Lessners. This puts our numbers in the triple digits.,9,9895
9895,2,21,Robin ,"Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more.",10,9896
9896,2,21,Ted ,"Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie?",11,9897
9897,2,21,Marshall ,You know what? That's okay. It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.,12,9898
9898,2,21,Lily ,"So it's not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore. Marshall's dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in New York, he's going to get mugged, so it's going to be inside now. It'll be great. We're still going to have our acoustic guitar player.",13,9899
9899,2,21,Lily ,"So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp.",14,9900
9900,2,21,Barney ,"Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross ""harp player"" off my list.",15,9901
9901,2,21,Marshall ,How long is this list?,16,9902
9902,2,21,Barney ,"Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass.",17,9903
9903,2,21,Lily ,"Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant.",18,9904
9904,2,21,Barney ,Sweet! I can cross off two things.,19,9905
9905,2,21,,Ted (2030): And the day arrives for Lily and Marshall's very big indoor wedding... with a harp.,20,9906
9906,2,21,Andrea ,"Hi, Lily.",21,9907
9907,2,21,Lily ,Wow. Andrea. You really are pregnant.,22,9908
9908,2,21,Andrea ,Yeah.,23,9909
9909,2,21,Robin ,How do you play the harp with your belly so...?,24,9910
9910,2,21,Andrea ,"Oh, I don't really-- I can only reach about half the strings.",25,9911
9911,2,21,Robin ,You only play half the harp?,26,9912
9912,2,21,Andrea ,Yeah.,27,9913
9913,2,21,Robin ,"Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn?",28,9914
9914,2,21,Andrea ,I've been studying the harp for 12 years.,29,9915
9915,2,21,Robin ,"Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of ""Guitar Hero""? Learned that in a day. Is there a ""Harp Hero""?",30,9916
9916,2,21,Lily ,"Robin, it's fine. So, so, when are you due?",31,9917
9917,2,21,Andrea ,Tuesday.,32,9918
9918,2,21,Lily ,"Wow, that's soon.",33,9919
9919,2,21,Andrea ,Last Tuesday.,34,9920
9920,2,21,Robin ,"Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony.",35,9921
9921,2,21,Lily ,"Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, ""Oh, my wedding has to be perfect."" Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional.",36,9922
9922,2,21,Barney ,Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?,37,9923
9923,2,21,Barman ,No. I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception.,38,9924
9924,2,21,Barney ,"Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy.",39,9925
9925,2,21,Barman ,"I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy.",40,9926
9926,2,21,Barney ,"You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy.",41,9927
9927,2,21,Barney ,"Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? ""Hey, baby, want to pluck?""",42,9928
9928,2,21,Robin ,Really? That didn't work.,43,9929
9929,2,21,Barney ,Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill?,44,9930
9930,2,21,Lily ,Bill?,45,9931
9931,2,21,Barney ,Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar.,46,9932
9932,2,21,Bill ,Can I ask you something? Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects?,47,9933
9933,2,21,Barney ,Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.,48,9934
9934,2,21,Bill ,"Oh, so when do you think someone should do it? Just wait for a lull or what?",49,9935
9935,2,21,Lily ,"Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?",50,9936
9936,2,21,Barney ,He kind of did.,51,9937
9937,2,21,Lily ,That's Scooter.,52,9938
9938,2,21,Robin ,"Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?",53,9939
9939,2,21,Lily ,His real name is Bill. My mom must have invited him.,54,9940
9940,2,21,Robin ,Why? Why would she do that?,55,9941
9941,2,21,Lily ,"Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine.",56,9942
9942,2,21,Barney ,I'll get it.,57,9943
9943,2,21,Lily ,"Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?",58,9944
9944,2,21,Barney ,He's great. He's about to get his hair cut.,59,9945
9945,2,21,Lily ,Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.,60,9946
9946,2,21,Barney ,"Me, too. I was up all night.",61,9947
9947,2,21,Scooter ,"Hello, Lily.",62,9948
9948,2,21,Barney ,"Hey, Bill.",63,9949
9949,2,21,Scooter ,"Hey, Barney.",64,9950
9950,2,21,Lily ,"Scooter, what are you doing here?",65,9951
9951,2,21,Scooter ,"It's not ""Scooter"" anymore. It's Bill. A lot of things have changed about me, Lily, but one hasn't. I still love you. And I came here to win you back.",66,9952
9952,2,21,Lily ,"You're really cute. Oh, no. Really?",67,9953
9953,2,21,Lily ,I want... I want... Scooter!,68,9954
9954,2,21,Barney ,I need a glass of wine.,69,9955
9955,2,21,Barman ,And I need you to get out of my face.,70,9956
9956,2,21,Barney ,"It's for the bride, so...",71,9957
9957,2,21,Barney ,"White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda.",72,9958
9958,2,21,Barman ,You got it.,73,9959
9959,2,21,Barney ,She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds.,74,9960
9960,2,21,Barman ,"I don't have any, but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some.",75,9961
9961,2,21,Barney ,"Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin.",76,9962
9962,2,21,Barney ,Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.,77,9963
9963,2,21,Scooter ,"Maybe my words won't change your mind, but maybe the words of a poet will. I read from ""November Rain."" By W. Axl Rose.",78,9964
9964,2,21,Robin ,That is a good song.,79,9965
9965,2,21,Brad ,Barney said you needed me to bounce some guy named Scooter?,80,9966
9966,2,21,Brad ,What's up with Bill?,81,9967
9967,2,21,Robin ,That's Scooter.,82,9968
9968,2,21,Brad ,I'm on it.,83,9969
9969,2,21,Barney ,Hey.,84,9970
9970,2,21,Woman ,Hey.,85,9971
9971,2,21,Barney ,Can I have your phone number?,86,9972
9972,2,21,Woman ,No.,87,9973
9973,2,21,Barney ,It's for the bride.,88,9974
9974,2,21,Woman ,Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen.,89,9975
9975,2,21,Barney ,The bride wants you to walk slower.,90,9976
9976,2,21,Robin ,"Oh, wow.",91,9977
9977,2,21,Lily ,"Oh. Robin... My makeup looks perfect right now, and I'm about to cry. Do something.",92,9978
9978,2,21,Robin ,I have hairy nipples.,93,9979
9979,2,21,Lily ,Really?,94,9980
9980,2,21,Robin ,"No, but it worked, didn't it?",95,9981
9981,2,21,Brad ,"Hey. Funny story. I tackled this guy I thought was Scooter. Turns out it was your photographer. Don't worry. I got this sweet camera phone, so we're covered.",96,9982
9982,2,21,Robin ,"There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call...",97,9983
9983,2,21,Lily ,"Robin, stop. Stop. It's okay. I am not gonna let anything get to me today.",98,9984
9984,2,21,Woman ,I just got a call from the florist. The flowers won't be here till halfway through the ceremony.,99,9985
9985,2,21,Lily ,I'm okay.,100,9986
9986,2,21,Man ,"I hate to bother you, but... I think I found your veil in the parking lot.",101,9987
9987,2,21,Lily ,I'm fine.,102,9988
9988,2,21,Andrea ,Just FYI: my water broke. But I can probably......make it through.,103,9989
9989,2,21,Lily ,Totally cool.,104,9990
9990,2,21,Robin ,"Oh, no. Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry.",105,9991
9991,2,21,Lily ,"Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on.",106,9992
9992,2,21,Robin ,Are you sure?,107,9993
9993,2,21,Lily ,"I'm marrying Marshall today. So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil in a room that has no flowers to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning, as my high school boyfriend reads g*ns N' Roses lyrics. But that's okay, because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway.",108,9994
9994,2,21,Robin ,"Lily, are you okay?",109,9995
9995,2,21,Lily ,What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay! Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has! It's ruined!,110,9996
9996,2,21,Robin ,"What happened to ""I don't want a perfect wedding""?",111,9997
9997,2,21,Lily ,"Oh, grow up, Robin! Of course I want a perfect wedding! Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but... I do. I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today.",112,9998
9998,2,21,Robin ,"And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better.",113,9999
9999,2,21,Lily ,"What could you have that could possibly make me feel better? God, I hope Marshall's having a better day than I'm having.",114,10000
10000,2,21,Marshall ,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!",115,10001
10001,2,21,Ted ,What?,116,10002
10002,2,21,Barney ,"Well, it's not too short.",117,10003
10003,2,21,Marshall ,My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!,118,10004
10004,2,21,Barney ,"You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.",119,10005
10005,2,21,Ted ,The good Backstreet Boys?,120,10006
10006,2,21,Marshall ,Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?!,121,10007
10007,2,21,Ted ,What-what the hell happened to you?,122,10008
10008,2,21,Marshall ,"Lily's cousin is in beauty school, and Lily didn't want her to do her hair, so she said she could do mine.",123,10009
10009,2,21,Marshall ,"So, um, just not-not too short, okay?",124,10010
10010,2,21,Cousin ,"Oh, no, we don't even have to cut it at all. Could just give it some style.",125,10011
10011,2,21,Marshall ,"Oh, okay, yeah, that's great. 'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird. And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know.",126,10012
10012,2,21,Cousin ,"Ooh, I could give you some cool guy tips.",127,10013
10013,2,21,Marshall ,"I don't think I need advice on how to be cool, but yeah, great, lay that on me.",128,10014
10014,2,21,Marshall ,I can't get married like this! There's no way!,129,10015
10015,2,21,Barney ,"Ah, let me see what I can do.",130,10016
10016,2,21,Ted ,What? What can you do?,131,10017
10017,2,21,Barney ,I have a superpower.,132,10018
10018,2,21,Marshall ,Lily is gonna k*ll me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this.,133,10019
10019,2,21,Ted ,That's crazy. Of course she will.,134,10020
10020,2,21,Marshall ,Would you marry me?,135,10021
10021,2,21,Ted ,No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule: never marry anyone you've had a farting contest with.,136,10022
10022,2,21,Marshall ,"Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?",137,10023
10023,2,21,Barney ,"Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?",138,10024
10024,2,21,Ted ,"Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution.",139,10025
10025,2,21,Marshall ,"Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?!",140,10026
10026,2,21,Ted ,What?!,141,10027
10027,2,21,Marshall ,You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo.,142,10028
10028,2,21,Ted ,"Dude, those guys are criminals.",143,10029
10029,2,21,Marshall ,"Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something!",144,10030
10030,2,21,Ted ,"Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these.",145,10031
10031,2,21,Marshall ,No!,146,10032
10032,2,21,Ted ,"Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?",147,10033
10033,2,21,Ben ,Yes.,148,10034
10034,2,21,Ted ,"Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out.",149,10035
10035,2,21,Ben ,Yeah.,150,10036
10036,2,21,Ted ,Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head.,151,10037
10037,2,21,Ben ,"Oh, no!",152,10038
10038,2,21,Ted ,"Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area?",153,10039
10039,2,21,Ben ,"Yeah, that would probably work, but with what? That's a tough one.",154,10040
10040,2,21,Ted ,"Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches",155,10041
10041,2,21,Ben ,"Mm, yeah. Does anyone here wear a toupee? (Ben's wearing a toupee) Shouldn't be hard to find out. Most of them are pretty bad.",156,10042
10042,2,21,Ted ,That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair.,157,10043
10043,2,21,Ben ,"Boy, that's a pretty tall order.",158,10044
10044,2,21,Ted ,Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?,159,10045
10045,2,21,Ben ,"No, not off the top of my... No. Can't.",160,10046
10046,2,21,Ted ,Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee.,161,10047
10047,2,21,Barney ,The bride needs this.,162,10048
10048,2,21,Marshall ,"Actually, I think it kinda works.",163,10049
10049,2,21,Ted ,It totally does.,164,10050
10050,2,21,Marshall ,Barney?,165,10051
10051,2,21,Barney ,"To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it.",166,10052
10052,2,21,Marshall ,"Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it?",167,10053
10053,2,21,Ted ,"It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.",168,10054
10054,2,21,Marshall ,"Oh, you know...",169,10055
10055,2,21,Ted ,In a bad way.,170,10056
10056,2,21,Brad ,"Hey. Cool hair, bro.",171,10057
10057,2,21,Ted ,What happened to your shirt?,172,10058
10058,2,21,Brad ,I got sauce on it when I tackled the caterer.,173,10059
10059,2,21,Ted ,You gonna put another shirt on?,174,10060
10060,2,21,Brad ,"No, I'm good. Hey, you guys seen Scooter?",175,10061
10061,2,21,Marshall ,What? What? Scooter's here? That guy's at my wedding?,176,10062
10062,2,21,Brad ,"Not for long, bro. Not for long.",177,10063
10063,2,21,Marshall ,"Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay?",178,10064
10064,2,21,Barney ,It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.,179,10065
10065,2,21,Ted ,"Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress.",180,10066
10066,2,21,Marshall ,"Oh, no.",181,10067
10067,2,21,Lily ,"Oh, my God! Marshall...",182,10068
10068,2,21,Marshall ,"Lily, you're not supposed to see me.",183,10069
10069,2,21,Robin ,"Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you.",184,10070
10070,2,21,Lily ,What happened? Did Amy do this to you?,185,10071
10071,2,21,Marshall ,"Just the frosted tips. I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby. I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I?",186,10072
10072,2,21,Lily ,"Oh, no, you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie. It was already ruined. There's no flowers, no photographer. Oh, and Scooter's here, by the way.",187,10073
10073,2,21,Marshall ,"Yeah, I know. I heard.",188,10074
10074,2,21,Lily ,"My veil got thrashed, the harp player is in labor, and I'm not wearing my wedding underwear.",189,10075
10075,2,21,Marshall ,"What? No ""Property of Marshall"" across the back? How are people going to know whose butt that is?",190,10076
10076,2,21,Lily ,"What happened? Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony?",191,10077
10077,2,21,Marshall ,I wish we could have that wedding.,192,10078
10078,2,21,Ted ,So do it.,193,10079
10079,2,21,Marshall ,What?,194,10080
10080,2,21,Ted ,"Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate.",195,10081
10081,2,21,Barney ,"Yes. Yes, I can. Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something: your jaws-- because Barney Stinson is about to aid and abet a marriage.",196,10082
10082,2,21,Marshall ,"Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there?",197,10083
10083,2,21,Robin ,"Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here.",198,10084
10084,2,21,Marshall ,"What do you think, baby?",199,10085
10085,2,21,Lily ,I love it.,200,10086
10086,2,21,Marshall ,"Me, too. Let's do it. Let's get married before we get married.",201,10087
10087,2,21,Lily ,"Great. Wait, hold on. Excuse me, sir. Could we borrow your hat?",202,10088
10088,2,21,Man ,Okay.,203,10089

10090,2,21,Marshall ,Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat.,205,10091
10091,2,21,Barney ,"Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other.",206,10092

10097,2,21,Marshall ,"Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick. You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called ""Eggs Marshall,"" and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy.",212,10098

10113,2,21,,"Ted (2030): After that, we all went back inside for the second wedding. And yes, a lot of things did go wrong, but it didn't matter because when I look back on that day, what I remember is the first wedding; the intimate outdoor ceremony with just close friends and an acoustic guitar.",228,10114
10114,2,21,Marshall ,How do you feel?,229,10115

10180,2,22,Marshall ,"""Love is patient and kind. ""Love does not envy or boast. ""It is not arrogant or rude. ""Love does not insist on it's own way. ""It is not irritable or resentful. ""Love bears all things, ""believes all things, ""hopes all things... ""endures all things.""",61,10181
10181,2,22,Robin ,Lame.,62,10182
10182,2,22,Lily ,Going on the list.,63,10183
10183,2,22,Lily ,We've done it. A wedding with zero clichées.,64,10184
10184,2,22,Ted ,"Wait, isn't doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a clichée?",65,10185
10185,2,22,Lily ,"Well, okay, one clichée.",66,10186

10190,2,22,Marshall ,Yeah...,71,10191
10191,2,22,Barney ,"Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something, so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great.",72,10192
10192,2,22,Lily ,"No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well...",73,10193
10193,2,22,Barney ,Are those mini quiches? (Marshall and Lily run) Tell the secret.,74,10194

10205,2,22,Barney ,"Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away.(Lily and Marshall leave) So what was in the glass?",86,10206
10206,2,22,Ted ,"Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, ""Champagne?"" ""We didn't order any champagne."" ""Compliments of the house."" ""Wow.""",87,10207
10207,2,22,Barney ,You said that already!,88,10208
10208,2,22,Ted (voice over) ,"Right. So Robin looks down, and there at the bottom of her glass...",89,10209

10213,2,22,Barney ,"An engagement ring?No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do",94,10214
10214,2,22,Ted ,That's what she said.,95,10215
10215,2,22,Robin ,"No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no.",96,10216
10216,2,22,Ted ,What are you talking about?,97,10217
10217,2,22,Robin ,"This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here.",98,10218
10218,2,22,Ted ,That's not mine.,99,10219
10219,2,22,Robin ,What?,100,10220
10220,2,22,Ted ,That's not mine.,101,10221

10226,2,22,Robin ,What the hell was what?,107,10227
10227,2,22,Ted ,That reaction?,108,10228
10228,2,22,Robin ,I thought you were proposing to me.,109,10229
10229,2,22,Ted ,Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire.,110,10230

10231,2,22,Ted ,Now more than ever.,112,10232
10232,2,22,Robin ,"I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight?",113,10233
10233,2,22,Ted ,No.,114,10234
10234,2,22,Robin ,Then why is this an issue?,115,10235
10235,2,22,Ted ,"Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, ""No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. ""Ted, you cannot do this to me. ""No. No, no, no.""",116,10236
10236,2,22,Robin ,"Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go?",117,10237

10242,2,22,Lily (burping) ,Yes.,123,10243
10243,2,22,Marshall ,"Lily, you could have burped or said the word ""Yes,"" but the fact that you did both is exactly why I married you.",124,10244
10244,2,22,Lily ,"Oh, look, more strawberries!",125,10245
10245,2,22,Barney ,So what happened next?,126,10246
10246,2,22,Robin ,"Ted, don't do this.",127,10247
10247,2,22,Ted ,"No, seriously. Where do you see yourself in five years?",128,10248
10248,2,22,Robin ,Where do you see yourself?,129,10249
10249,2,22,Ted ,"Honestly, in five years... I probably want to be married.",130,10250
10250,2,22,Robin ,And I probably want to be in Argentina.,131,10251
10251,2,22,Ted ,Argentina?,132,10252
10252,2,22,Robin ,"Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure.",133,10253
10253,2,22,Ted ,"We have an expiration date, don't we?",134,10254
10254,2,22,Barney ,"Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it.",135,10255
10255,2,22,Ted ,Barney... story's not over.,136,10256
10256,2,22,Robin ,Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home?,137,10257
10257,2,22,Ted ,"Yeah, of course. Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this. Can we actually...",138,10258
10258,2,22,Waiter ,"Oh, my God, it's you.",139,10259
10259,2,22,Ted ,Wha... what?,140,10260
10260,2,22,Waiter ,You're the son of a bitch who stole our blue French horn.,141,10261
10261,2,22,Ted ,Run!,142,10262
10262,2,22,Barney ,Run? Your strategy was run?,143,10263
10263,2,22,Ted ,It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it.,144,10264
10264,2,22,Robin ,Yeah? And how did that work out for you?,145,10265
10265,2,22,Ted ,I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license till we bring the horn back.,146,10266
10266,2,22,Robin ,"Well, come on, Ted, can you blame them?",147,10267
10267,2,22,Ted ,"Look, I'm sorry about the French horn. I want to make this right. So what we're going to do right now is, we're going to run!",148,10268
10268,2,22,Ted ,So... Argentina.,149,10269
10269,2,22,Robin ,Argentina.,150,10270
10270,2,22,Ted ,Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina?,151,10271
10271,2,22,Robin ,"Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there.",152,10272
10272,2,22,Ted ,I could want to live in Argentina.,153,10273
10273,2,22,Robin ,"No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does.",154,10274
10274,2,22,Ted ,"Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too. They have buildings in Argentina. And Paris. And even Tokyo. I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.",155,10275
10275,2,22,Robin ,"So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?",156,10276
10276,2,22,Ted ,"Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina.",157,10277
10277,2,22,Robin ,"Oh, shut up.",158,10278
10278,2,22,Ted ,You're scared I might not be kidding.,159,10279
10279,2,22,Robin ,Aren't you?,160,10280
10280,2,22,Ted ,"Nope. Your move, Scherbatsky.",161,10281
10281,2,22,Robin ,Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.,162,10282
10282,2,22,Barney ,"No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina. The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years, the government is opposed to free market reforms, and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium. Man, she was chatty.",163,10283
10283,2,22,Robin ,Right? Right?,164,10284
10284,2,22,Barney ,You caught the bouquet?,165,10285
10285,2,22,Ted ,Barney. The story's not over yet.,166,10286
10286,2,22,Robin ,"Wait, wait, wait, wait.",167,10287
10287,2,22,Ted ,What?,168,10288
10288,2,22,Robin ,I don't know if I can do this to you.,169,10289
10289,2,22,Ted ,Do what?,170,10290
10290,2,22,Robin ,"Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids.",171,10291

10292,2,22,Robin ,You know what I mean.,173,10293
10293,2,22,Ted ,"No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect.",174,10294

10878,3,3,Rachel ,"Trudy, no way!",51,10879
10879,3,3,Trudy ,"Oh my God, Rachel, how are you?",52,10880
10880,3,3,Trudy ,"Ted, this is Rachel.",53,10881
10881,3,3,Rachel ,Hi.,54,10882

10883,3,3,Ted ,"Let me guess, you guys met in prison.",56,10884
10884,3,3,Rachel ,"No, we're sorority sisters.",57,10885
10885,3,3,Trudy ,"And best friends forever, all sophomore year.",58,10886
10886,3,3,Rachel ,When we weren't at each other's throats.,59,10887
10887,3,3,Trudy ,We could be so competitive. But that's all behind us now.,60,10888
10888,3,3,Rachel ,"(singing and dancing) Hey, mista...",61,10889
10889,3,3,,"Rachel, Trudy: (Trudy joins in singing and dancing)... hey mista, stay away from my sista.",62,10890
10890,3,3,Trudy ,We have so much catching up do to.,63,10891
10891,3,3,Rachel ,"OK, are you going to Stacy's wedding?",64,10892
10892,3,3,Trudy ,"Oh, it's off, apparently he's into dudes.",65,10893
10893,3,3,Rachel ,No! Again? That's like her third one.,66,10894
10894,3,3,Trudy ,I know.,67,10895
10895,3,3,Ted ,"Well, beers, what do you want to do? Stay here, or I know this other place called my belly.",68,10896
10896,3,3,Rachel ,"So, Trudy and I got a table.",69,10897
10897,3,3,Ted ,"Oh, that's cool, I was gonna get outta here anyway, I'm really tired.",70,10898
10898,3,3,Rachel ,But I want you to stay.,71,10899
10899,3,3,Ted ,Tired of people who fold early 'cause I am wide awake.,72,10900
10900,3,3,Ted ,"OK, guys, be cool.",73,10901
10901,3,3,Marshall ,"Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean.",74,10902
10902,3,3,Barney ,That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.,75,10903
10903,3,3,Barney ,Stinson.,76,10904
10904,3,3,Ted ,"I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident.",77,10905
10905,3,3,Barney ,"You mean, the girl who chalked your pool cue and snuck down the fire escape.",78,10906
10906,3,3,Ted ,"So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive.",79,10907
10907,3,3,Barney ,So you now have two on the line?,80,10908
10908,3,3,Ted ,And I don't know which one to go for.,81,10909
10909,3,3,Barney ,Go for the new girl.,82,10910
10910,3,3,Barney ,"Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove.",83,10911
10911,3,3,Lily ,New girl? What new girl?,84,10912
10912,3,3,Barney ,Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections and I think...,85,10913
10913,3,3,Lily ,"Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. Give it to me.",86,10914
10914,3,3,Lily ,Are they friends? (Ted on phone),87,10915
10915,3,3,Ted ,"Yeah. No, I don't know. They're old sorority sisters.",88,10916
10916,3,3,Lily ,Are they Betas?,89,10917
10917,3,3,Lily ,Because they're all sluts and you can tell them right now I didn't wanna be in their sorority anyway.,90,10918
10918,3,3,Ted ,"They're Kappas and I think I can score with one of them. I don't know which one and if I choose wrong, I lose 'em both.",91,10919
10919,3,3,Lily ,"OK, well, don't worry, I'll come down and help you figure it out.",92,10920
10920,3,3,Marshall ,I thought we were in for the evening.,93,10921
10921,3,3,Barney ,"That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there but I guess we're both wrong, governor.",94,10922
10922,3,3,Trudy ,"Oh, Ted, OK, settle an argument. Is it stealing if you go out with someone's boyfriend after they've broken up?",95,10923
10923,3,3,Ted ,"Well, that's very complicated.",96,10924
10924,3,3,Rachel ,"See, he agrees with me. You're such a little man-thief.",97,10925
10925,3,3,Trudy ,"You're the man-thief, man-thief.",98,10926
10926,3,3,Ted ,"Oh, somebody should lock you girls up.",99,10927
10927,3,3,Trudy ,You're so funny. I think Ted is funny.,100,10928
10928,3,3,Rachel ,Really? I think Ted is hilarious.,101,10929
10929,3,3,Ted ,(muttering to himself) I am never not wearing a suit again.,102,10930
10930,3,3,Ted ,Hello.,103,10931
10931,3,3,Lily ,"It's me, I'm at the bar. Don't look, just call me mom.",104,10932
10932,3,3,Ted ,"Hi Mom, how's dad's colon?",105,10933
10933,3,3,Lily ,"What? What's the matter with you? Anyway, both of these girls are into you. Take your pick.",106,10934
10934,3,3,Ted ,They are? Are you sure?,107,10935
10935,3,3,Lily ,"Yes, of course. They're playing with their hair and touching your arm. Class green light.",108,10936
10936,3,3,Ted ,Are you positive?,109,10937
10937,3,3,Robin ,That is so fascinating. So what happened?,110,10938
10938,3,3,Robin's date," Well, after eighteen hours of surgery, I closed and thankfully both girls just celebrated their second birthday.",111,10939
10939,3,3,Robin ,"Wow, gosh, separating conjoined twins. That must be the most amazing feeling.",112,10940
10940,3,3,Robin's date," True, but now the parents don't know what to do with their huge supply of four-legged overalls.",113,10941
10941,3,3,Robin ,That is so funny. You are so funny.,114,10942
10942,3,3,Lily ,"Positive. They both want you bad. It's a clearance sale and you're the boots, baby.",115,10943
10943,3,3,Lily ,"Oh, it's Robin. Good luck.",116,10944
10944,3,3,Ted ,Bye mom.,117,10945
10945,3,3,Ted ,My mom.,118,10946
10946,3,3,Lily ,Hello.,119,10947
10947,3,3,Robin ,Bring me a razor.,120,10948
10948,3,3,Lily ,What about the no-shave rule? What happened to your convictions?,121,10949
10949,3,3,Robin ,They've been surgically removed by Dr. Awesome.,122,10950
10950,3,3,Lily ,"No, I'm not doing it. The whole point to not shaving...",123,10951
10951,3,3,Robin ,"Lily, please, he's really cute and I really like him. And he's got a British accent.",124,10952
10952,3,3,Lily ,I'm on my way.,125,10953
10953,3,3,Ted ,"So, this college boyfriend, who, who won him?",126,10954
10954,3,3,Trudy ,Neither of us.,127,10955
10955,3,3,Rachel ,"He left, junior year abroad.",128,10956
10956,3,3,Trudy ,It's really too bad. There was that one thing we wanted to do.,129,10957
10957,3,3,Rachel ,"We were gonna do, but never did.",130,10958
10958,3,3,Ted ,"What? What, what were you guys gonna do but never did.",131,10959
10959,3,3,Rachel ,"No, It's too embarrassing. You tell him.",132,10960
10960,3,3,Trudy ,"No, you tell him.",133,10961
10961,3,3,Rachel ,I don't care if you don't care.,134,10962
10962,3,3,Trudy ,I don't care.,135,10963
10963,3,3,Ted ,"Nobody cares, just say it.",136,10964
10964,3,3,Rachel ,Why don't we tell him together?,137,10965
10965,3,3,Trudy ,"OK, on three.",138,10966
10966,3,3,Trudy ,One.,139,10967
10967,3,3,Lily ,"Well, he's right, it's a dead heat.",140,10968
10968,3,3,Trudy ,Two.,141,10969
10969,3,3,Lily ,Neither one is giving ground. I could not tell who was the third wheel.,142,10970
10970,3,3,Trudy ,Three,143,10971
10971,3,3,Ted ,It's a tricycle.,144,10972
10972,3,3,Barney ,"No way, no way, no way!",145,10973
10973,3,3,Marshall ,What's happening?,146,10974
10974,3,3,Ted ,It's a tricycle.,147,10975
10975,3,3,Marshall ,"No way, no way, no way. It's a tricycle.",148,10976
10976,3,3,Lily ,"Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts.",149,10977
10977,3,3,Barney ,Put him on speaker.,150,10978
10978,3,3,Barney ,So what you're saying to us right now is you have a shot at the belt?,151,10979
10979,3,3,Marshall ,"Wait wait wait, what belt?",152,10980
10980,3,3,Ted ,Barney and I have this running joke that the first guy to actually pull this off would win the championship belt.,153,10981
10981,3,3,Marshall ,"Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt, right?",154,10982
10982,3,3,,(flashback to Barney removing a large belt from a box) Barney: Behold.,155,10983
10983,3,3,Ted ,You actually bought a belt.,156,10984
10984,3,3,Barney ,"That's right, it's resplendent.",157,10985
10985,3,3,Ted ,"It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around.",158,10986
10986,3,3,Barney ,"I never kid. Remember you said if I ever slept with that girl from Days of our Lives, I'd be the king? Well...",159,10987
10987,3,3,Marshall ,Why wasn't I told about the belt? I could go for the belt.,160,10988
10988,3,3,Marshall ,"If Lily were to die before me, then I could ride the tricycle.",161,10989
10989,3,3,Lily ,"If I died, I'd just come back and haunt your pen1s.",162,10990
10990,3,3,Ted ,"Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?",163,10991
10991,3,3,Barney ,"All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?",164,10992
10992,3,3,Ted ,Yes.,165,10993
10993,3,3,Barney ,"Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds.",166,10994
10994,3,3,Ted ,Yes.,167,10995
10995,3,3,Barney ,"Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women?",168,10996
10996,3,3,Ted ,What? No.,169,10997
10997,3,3,Barney ,Ted?,170,10998
10998,3,3,Ted ,"No. Look, I gotta go. They're gonna think I inherited my dad's imaginary bathroom issues.",171,10999
10999,3,3,Ted ,"Oh, are you guys leaving?",172,11000
11000,3,3,Rachel ,"Well, it is getting pretty late.",173,11001
11001,3,3,Ted ,"Right, well...",174,11002
11002,3,3,Trudy ,I thought maybe we could all go and listen to that Wilco CD you talked about before.,175,11003
11003,3,3,Ted ,"Great, I have it right upstairs. It's in my apartment upstairs. Let's so upstairs.",176,11004
11004,3,3,Rachel ,"I'm sorry, where was your apartment again?",177,11005
11005,3,3,Ted ,That's funny. I love that. You should tell more jokes at my apartment upstairs.,178,11006
11006,3,3,Marshall ,"Scenario number 12. We're in a horrific car crash, you die, I'm left paralyzed. Two sexy nurses with a six-pack of wine coolers sneak into my room late at night. I try to blink at them in morse code, ""Please, don't, I love my dead wife,"" but they're medical professionals and I gotta think somehow they're saving my life.",179,11007
11007,3,3,Lily ,"Fine, sleep with your nurses. Tonight you ride the unicycle.",180,11008
11008,3,3,Marshall ,I already did this morning.,181,11009
11009,3,3,Lily ,Hello.,182,11010
11010,3,3,Robin ,"Lily, I have pounded three cappuccinos waiting for you. Pretty soon I won't have to shave, the hair is going to vibrate off my legs.",183,11011
11011,3,3,Lily ,"Sorry, I can't leave now.",184,11012
11012,3,3,Robin ,"Lily, he can't see my legs like this. I look like a Turkish lesbian",185,11013
11013,3,3,Robin ,There is a pharmacy across the street. Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?,186,11014
11014,3,3,Waitress ,"No, but fifty will.",187,11015
11015,3,3,Barney ,"Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me. (reading text) We're combing upsars.",188,11016
11016,3,3,Marshall ,We're combing upsars? What does that mean?,189,11017
11017,3,3,Lily ,He's coming upstairs!,190,11018
11018,3,3,Marshall ,Where are my pants? Where's my pants!,191,11019
11019,3,3,Ted ,Got 'em.,192,11020
11020,3,3,Rachel ,"Ooh, nice place!",193,11021
11021,3,3,Rachel ,"Hey, are these your roommates?",194,11022
11022,3,3,Ted ,"Yes, yes, but they are not here. They are somewhere else. We have total privacy because privacy is essential when you're listening to music.",195,11023
11023,3,3,Rachel ,You know what else is essential when you're listening to music? Music.,196,11024
11024,3,3,Ted ,That's hilarious. You are hilarious. I'll go get it in my bedroom. The CD's in my bedroom. Bedroom.,197,11025
11025,3,3,Rachel ,"OK, we'll try and stay out of trouble.",198,11026
11026,3,3,Trudy ,Of course we can't promise anything.,199,11027
11027,3,3,Ted ,This is gonna be awesome.,200,11028
11028,3,3,Ted ,No!,201,11029
11029,3,3,Ted ,"What are you guys doing here? I've got, I've got...",202,11030
11030,3,3,Lily ,"We know, we know, Ted. Well done, this is very impressive. Up top.",203,11031
11031,3,3,Marshall ,"Yeah bro, up top.",204,11032
11032,3,3,Lily ,"Oh, don't be gross.",205,11033
11033,3,3,Ted ,"You guys need to get out of here right now. Please, take the fire escape.",206,11034
11034,3,3,Marshall ,"No, no way. The other day I saw a pigeon take a crap on it and the whole thing shifted.",207,11035
11035,3,3,Lily ,"Oh, you can use our bedroom.",208,11036
11036,3,3,Ted ,"OK, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD...Barney.",209,11037
11037,3,3,Ted ,What are you doing?,210,11038
11038,3,3,Barney ,I cannot allow Ted to do this.,211,11039
11039,3,3,Ted ,"Why, why?",212,11040
11040,3,3,Barney ,Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom.,213,11041
11041,3,3,Marshall ,"But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting.",214,11042
11042,3,3,Barney ,"I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.",215,11043
11043,3,3,Barney ,"So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?",216,11044
11044,3,3,Blonde Girl," Oh my God. My new carpet. Oh my God, this is a disaster, You get the carpet cleaner, I'll get a towel.",217,11045
11045,3,3,Brunette Girl, OK.,218,11046
11046,3,3,Barney ,I'll get the video camera.,219,11047
11047,3,3,Blonde Girl, Get out!,220,11048
11048,3,3,Barney ,OK then.,221,11049
11049,3,3,Ted ,Let me get this straight. You're gonna trike block me? That is so petty. It's like you're...,222,11050
11050,3,3,Marshall ,Tom Petty.,223,11051
11051,3,3,Ted ,Tom Petty. You're Tom Petty.,224,11052
11052,3,3,Ted ,Where's Lily?,225,11053
11053,3,3,Ted ,"Still looking for that CD, so...",226,11054
11054,3,3,Ted ,What are you doing?,227,11055
11055,3,3,Lily ,I knew it. I had a hunch about that girl and I was right.,228,11056
11056,3,3,Lily ,I saw it first.,229,11057
11057,3,3,Lily ,"You just made the list, bitch.",230,11058
11058,3,3,Lily ,"I cannot give up my bedroom to a boot thief. She should be punished, not rewarded.",231,11059
11059,3,3,Ted ,"Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me.",232,11060
11060,3,3,Lily ,"No, never.",233,11061
11061,3,3,Ted ,"What if I reimburse you for the boots, full retail?",234,11062
11062,3,3,Lily ,"Thanks, enjoy our bedroom.",235,11063
11063,3,3,Ted ,"OK, take it.",236,11064
11064,3,3,Ted ,Wish me luck.,237,11065
11065,3,3,Barney ,Oh my God.,238,11066
11066,3,3,Robin ,Where's the shaving cream?,239,11067
11067,3,3,Waitress ,"Well, you didn't ask me for shaving cream.",240,11068
11068,3,3,Robin ,"Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream?",241,11069
11069,3,3,Waitress ,"Well, who doesn't shave their legs for her date?",242,11070
11070,3,3,Robin ,"Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude?",243,11071
11071,3,3,Waitress ,"Well, here's a little tip for you. Shave your legs before you leave the house, Sasquatch.",244,11072
11072,3,3,Robin's date," Hey Robin, the valet's brought the car around. I thought we'd go back to my place. You in the mood for a night cap?",245,11073
11073,3,3,Robin ,Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies room. I've got TB...tiny bladder. I'll meet you out front?,246,11074
11074,3,3,Robin's date, Yeah.,247,11075
11075,3,3,Robin ,You've gotta be kidding me.,248,11076
11076,3,3,Robin ,Excuse me.,249,11077
11077,3,3,Ted ,"So, I'm having a little trouble finding the CD.",250,11078
11078,3,3,Rachel ,"That's OK, we don't need music to have fun.",251,11079
11079,3,3,Ted ,Exactly.,252,11080
11080,3,3,Trudy ,"You do like to have fun, don't you Ted?",253,11081
11081,3,3,Ted ,"It's getting late, I'll get your coats.",254,11082
11082,3,3,Lily ,"I'll get your coats? Ted: I don't know why I said that. Why did I say that? It's the opposite of what I meant. I wanna take clothes off them, not put more on.",255,11083
11083,3,3,Marshall ,"Ted, you're ruining this for everyone.",256,11084
11084,3,3,Barney ,Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors shoot themselves in the foot.,257,11085
11085,3,3,Lily ,"What are you talking about? Barney: If you must know, it wasn't a freak beverage malfunction that stopped me from riding the tricycle that night.",258,11086
11086,3,3,Blonde Girl," So, Barney, why don't we take this party to a more horizontal location?",259,11087
11087,3,3,Barney ,"Oh no, the night's ruined!",260,11088
11088,3,3,Brunette Girl," No, baby, it's not.",261,11089
11089,3,3,Barney ,Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?,262,11090
11090,3,3,Marshall ,Why would you do that to yourself?,263,11091
11091,3,3,Barney ,"Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me.",264,11092
11092,3,3,Ted ,"See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?",265,11093

11296,3,4,Barney ,"We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted: You know what, I don't mind. Barney: No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak.",157,11297
11297,3,4,Barney ,"No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going (lowers head slightly and shakes it vigorously) on what I've already gone (lowers head again slightly and shakes it vigorously) on.",158,11298
11298,3,4,Ted ,"Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?",159,11299

11306,3,4,Robin ,"Well, tt's just getting a little bit too serious with the kid. You know, it's just not what I'm looking for. So, better that I break it off now before he gets too attached.",167,11307
11307,3,4,Robin ,What?,168,11308
11308,3,4,Lily ,"I hate to tell you this but, too late.",169,11309

11310,3,4,Robin ,Oh crap.,171,11311
11311,3,4,Robin ,"There's no way that's a picture of me. That woman has on hoop earrings, I don't even own hoop earrings. I have one pair and they're gold. Those are Fruit Loops.",172,11312
11312,3,4,Lily ,You are so in denial right now. And you're doing what you always do in relationships.,173,11313
11313,3,4,Robin ,We'll ask the guys. They'll tell you that's not me,174,11314
11314,3,4,Marshall ,That's totally you.,175,11315
11315,3,4,Robin ,You guys are totally crazy.,176,11316
11316,3,4,Ted ,"Hey, who drew the picture of Robin?",177,11317
11317,3,4,Robin ,It's not me.,178,11318
11318,3,4,Marshall ,"You're joking, right?",179,11319
11319,3,4,Robin ,It's not me.,180,11320
11320,3,4,Ted ,"""My new mommy."" Kinda has a nice ring to it.",181,11321
11321,3,4,Marshall ,"Hey, now that you're a mom, are you gonna start wearing those totally awesome jeans that go right up to your boobs?",182,11322
11322,3,4,Robin ,Do guys really think this is me?,183,11323
11323,3,4,Lily ,"Honey, it's you. And if you're gonna break up with George, you have to break up with his kid too.",184,11324
11324,3,4,Robin ,Really?,185,11325
11325,3,4,Lily ,"Yeah, you can't just abandon him. You have to talk to him. Come on, Robin, you know it's the right thing to do.",186,11326

11340,3,4,Robin ,"Oh, that is so sweet, Even though it doesn't rhyme.",201,11341
11341,3,4,Robin ,"Look, uh, Doug. There's no good way to say this.",202,11342
11342,3,4,Future Ted VO, Aunt Robin didn't know what to say. This kid had never been dumped before.,203,11343
11343,3,4,Robin ,"We need to talk. I just think, um, we both could use some space right now. It's not you, it's me. I know this hurts but you deserve someone better. I'm just really trying to focus on my career right now, you know. I just hope we can still be friends.",204,11344
11344,3,4,Brooke ,"Hi, I'm Brooke, I'm here for my date with George. You must be the babysitter.",205,11345

11346,3,4,Robin ,What the hell was that? Doug: That was my new mommy.,207,11347
11347,3,4,Robin ,"So, this picture is not of me?",208,11348
11348,3,4,Doug ,Why would I draw a picture of you?,209,11349
11349,3,4,Robin ,How many dates has she been on with your dad?,210,11350
11350,3,4,Doug ,Two.,211,11351
11351,3,4,Robin ,"Well, I've been on like five and you like her better?",212,11352
11352,3,4,Doug ,We just really connected.,213,11353
11353,3,4,Robin ,And what about me? You think I go around pouring cereal for every boy in town.,214,11354

11360,3,4,Ted ,"Well, I couldn't do it. I broke up with her. Thanks a lot by the way. A beautiful, sexy girl and all I could think about was you being there first. You were stuck in my head like a Chumbawumba song.",221,11361
11361,3,4,Marshall ,"Which Chumbawumba song? Barney: Well, what an interesting turn of events. It looks like I'm going to win.",222,11362
11362,3,4,Ted ,"What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped.",223,11363
11363,3,4,Barney ,That's what you think happened.,224,11364
11364,3,4,Ted ,"OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any...",225,11365
11365,3,4,Barney ,Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend?,226,11366
11366,3,4,Stacy ,You are so sweet.,227,11367

11500,3,5,Ted ,"Oh, I'm sorry about that.",99,11501
11501,3,5,Barney ,"No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh.",100,11502
11502,3,5,Ted ,"Oh man, I'm really sorry.",101,11503
11503,3,5,Barney ,"Wow, you bought that?",102,11504
11504,3,5,Ted ,"What? Barney: I just made that up mid-pee. It worked on you, it's definitely gonna work on that blonde chick at the end of the bar. Unless you're a total idiot. What's your name?",103,11505
11505,3,5,Ted ,Ted.,104,11506
11506,3,5,Barney ,"Are you a total idiot, Ted?",105,11507
11507,3,5,Ted ,"Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Barney: (laughs) Well played.",106,11508
11508,3,5,Barney ,I like you Ted.,107,11509
11509,3,5,Barney ,"Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.",108,11510
11510,3,5,Barney ,Barney. We met at the urinal.,109,11511
11511,3,5,Ted ,"Oh right, hi.",110,11512
11512,3,5,Barney ,"Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit.",111,11513
11513,3,5,Ted ,I'm not wearing a suit.,112,11514
11514,3,5,Barney ,"Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A.",113,11515
11515,3,5,Barney ,"Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes.",114,11516
11516,3,5,Barney ,"Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward.",115,11517
11517,3,5,Barney ,"(yelling at Ted) Edward, this is Audrey.",116,11518
11518,3,5,Audrey ,"You know, I actually know some sign language.",117,11519
11519,3,5,Audrey ,"(signing) Hi, my name is Audrey. Nice to meet you",118,11520
11520,3,5,Barney ,He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like.,119,11521
11521,3,5,Ted ,(signing) I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.,120,11522
11522,3,5,Barney ,What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.,121,11523
11523,3,5,Ted ,(signing) My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number.,122,11524
11524,3,5,Audrey ,Here. Call me.,123,11525
11525,3,5,Barney ,"And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever.",124,11526
11526,3,5,Ted ,"Barney, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.",125,11527
11527,3,5,Ted ,(signing) He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.,126,11528
11528,3,5,Barney ,"Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online.",127,11529
11529,3,5,Blah-blah," Oh my God, you told them.",128,11530
11530,3,5,Ted ,"OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies.",129,11531
11531,3,5,Barney ,"Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right?",130,11532
11532,3,5,Blah-blah," Wait, you guys dated. For how long?",131,11533
11533,3,5,Robin ,"A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about s*x, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?",132,11534
11534,3,5,Blah-blah," Oh, I see what's going on here, Ted, I'm just some random girl to make Robin jealous and after she takes you back, you probably won't even remember my name.",133,11535
11535,3,5,Ted ,"Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that.",134,11536
11536,3,5,Barney ,"Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale.",135,11537
11537,3,5,Barney ,She started the night here,136,11538
11538,3,5,Barney ,"But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone.",137,11539
11539,3,5,Barney ,Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to k*ll me with a brick.,138,11540
11540,3,5,Ted ,"I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Robin.",139,11541
11541,3,5,Blah-blah," Then why has she been trying to undermine me all night? I mean, look at her. She's laughing at me right now.",140,11542
11542,3,5,Blah-blah," I'm sorry, it's just Lily and Marshall's story is so romantic. I just wish we had something like that.",141,11543
11543,3,5,Ted ,Their story is not as magical as it seems.,142,11544
11544,3,5,Blah-blah, What do you mean?,143,11545
11545,3,5,Ted ,"No, I can't, it's kind of a secret.",144,11546
11546,3,5,Blah-blah," Well, how about I tell you a little secret about what you might get to do later tonight.",145,11547
11547,3,5,Ted ,"The night before Lily met Marshall, there was this party.",146,11548
11548,3,5,College Ted," Hey, you a freshwoman? I never use the word freshman. Sexist.",147,11549
11549,3,5,College Lily," Yeah, I'm a first-year. I'm in Hewitt 220.",148,11550
11550,3,5,College Ted," No way, Hewitt 110. You should totally come by.",149,11551
11551,3,5,College Lily," Maybe I will, Hewitt 110.",150,11552
11552,3,5,College students, Chug chug chug chug,151,11553
11553,3,5,College Ted," These drunk idiots. Hey, don't drink their two dollar beer. This is a pinot noir from Europe.",152,11554
11554,3,5,College Lily," Oh, it's fruity.",153,11555
11555,3,5,College Ted," Yeah, I cut it with some cranberry juice, it's pretty strong.",154,11556
11556,3,5,College Lily," So, uh, do you have a girlfriend?",155,11557
11557,3,5,College Ted," Yeah. Not sure about the whole long distance thing though. It's like Descartes says, ""In order to determine whether we can know anything with certainty, we first have to doubt everything we know."" You know?",156,11558
11558,3,5,College Lily, Wow.,157,11559
11559,3,5,Ted ,"As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me.",158,11560
11560,3,5,Blah-blah, Oh my God.,159,11561
11561,3,5,Ted ,"Yeah, and in all these years Lily and I have never spoken about it, so again, mum's the word, OK?",160,11562
11562,3,5,Blah-blah, You have to tell Marshall.,161,11563
11563,3,5,Ted ,"If he heard that, it would destroy him.",162,11564
11564,3,5,Blah-blah," If you don't tell him, I will.",163,11565
11565,3,5,Ted ,"Oh, come on, you wouldn't.",164,11566
11566,3,5,Ted ,Oh no.,165,11567
11567,3,5,Blah-blah," So, Lily, how did you and Ted meet? Come on, Lily, the real story.",166,11568
11568,3,5,Ted ,I don't think anyone wants to hear that story.,167,11569
11569,3,5,Lily ,"Don't be embarrassed, Ted, it was a long time ago.",168,11570
11570,3,5,College Ted," I made a huge mistake last night, but it's like Descartes says.",169,11571
11571,3,5,College Ted," In order to determine whether there's anything we can know with certain, we first have to doubt everything we know. And I now know for certain that I love you, Karen. Anyway, call me back when you get this. I'm also going down to the computer center to send you an electronic mail.",170,11572
11572,3,5,College Marshall," Ted, this is Lily.",171,11573
11573,3,5,College Ted," No, no, I'm sorry but I love Karen.",172,11574
11574,3,5,Ted ,"Yes, that is the unabridged story of how Lily and I met. How embarrassing. Who wants another round?",173,11575
11575,3,5,Blah-blah," That's not the story, Ted, tell 'em.",174,11576
11576,3,5,Marshall ,Tell us what?,175,11577
11577,3,5,Ted ,"Lily, will you help us get the next round?",176,11578
11578,3,5,Lily ,"Ted, what's going on?",177,11579
11579,3,5,Ted ,"She knows about us, about how we really met.",178,11580
11580,3,5,Lily ,"Yeah, I know, I just told her.",179,11581
11581,3,5,Ted ,"No, the real story.",180,11582
11582,3,5,Lily ,"Ted, what are you talking about?",181,11583
11583,3,5,Ted ,"Lily, come on.",182,11584
11584,3,5,Lily ,Come on what?,183,11585
11585,3,5,Ted ,"Lily, come on.",184,11586
11586,3,5,Lily ,"Ted, I honestly don't know what you're talking about.",185,11587
11587,3,5,Ted ,"Lily, come on.",186,11588
11588,3,5,Blah-blah, I know that you and Ted made out the night before you met Marshall.,187,11589
11589,3,5,Lily ,What? Ted and I never made out.,188,11590
11590,3,5,Ted ,"Yeah, we did.",189,11591
11591,3,5,Lily ,"I only made out with one other guy in college before I met Marshall, and it was just some random dude. I don't even remember his name. I just call him too-much-tongue guy.",190,11592
11592,3,5,Ted ,What? Too-much-tongue guy? I'm not surprised to hear that coming from unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.,191,11593
11593,3,5,Lily ,That wasn't me.,192,11594
11594,3,5,Ted ,"Yes it was, at the freshman orientation party.",193,11595
11595,3,5,Lily ,"No, no no no no no no no no no no no.",194,11596
11596,3,5,Barney ,"How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin: Yeah, like five or six times.",195,11597
11597,3,5,Barney ,It was right over there.,196,11598
11598,3,5,Barney ,"Here's your problem, you've only slept with one woman. Those kind of stats are only okay if you're eleven. But tonight, we're getting you a new girl because Marshall Eriksen, from this moment on, I make all your decisions for you.",197,11599
11599,3,5,Marshall ,"I'm sorry, who are you again?",198,11600
11600,3,5,Ted ,"This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass.",199,11601
11601,3,5,Barney ,"I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed.",200,11602
11602,3,5,Ted ,"You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.",201,11603
11603,3,5,Barney ,"No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference.",202,11604
11604,3,5,Ted ,"So we should make lots of Star Wars references around girls, that's what you're saying?",203,11605
11605,3,5,Marshall ,I'm not gonna cheat on my girlfriend.,204,11606
11606,3,5,Barney ,"Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her.",205,11607
11607,3,5,Barney ,"How much hotter is she than your girlfriend? Marshall: There's no comparison. What do you think, Ted? Go for it? Ted: Oh, don't do it, man. Think about Lily.",206,11608
11608,3,5,Marshall ,"You know what, I don't care. I've been with one woman for too long. I need me some strange.",207,11609
11609,3,5,Barney ,"Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger.",208,11610
11610,3,5,Barney ,Poor guy's gonna crash and burn.,209,11611
11611,3,5,Barney ,That man is a god.,210,11612
11612,3,5,Marshall ,"For like a week after, Barney followed me around, asking me to teach him how to live. I even got him to do my laundry once.",211,11613
11613,3,5,Barney ,I thought it was a Mr. Miyagi kind of thing.,212,11614
11614,3,5,Lily ,"Marshall, I need to talk to you. Can we go somewhere in private?",213,11615
11615,3,5,Marshall ,"Yeah, of course, what's wrong?",214,11616
11616,3,5,Blah-blah," Lily and Ted made out. What do you think of that, Robin? Marshall: What are you talking about? Lily: You know that guy I made out with at the freshman orientation party?",215,11617
11617,3,5,Marshall ,Too-much-tongue guy? Yeah.,216,11618
11618,3,5,Ted ,And you know that girl I made out with at the freshman orientation party?,217,11619
11619,3,5,Marshall ,Unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl? Yeah.,218,11620
11620,3,5,Ted ,I'm too-much-tongue guy.,219,11621
11621,3,5,Lily ,And I'm unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.,220,11622
11622,3,5,Barney ,Worst superheroes ever.,221,11623
11623,3,5,Lily ,"Baby, I am so sorry.",222,11624
11624,3,5,Marshall ,"I don't think you need to be. I was at that party. It was dark, and granted, I had eaten quite a few sandwiches but I'm a hundred percent sure that unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl was Alexa Leskies, it's not Lily.",223,11625
11625,3,5,Ted ,"Really? Marshall: Yeah, I'm positive. And too-much-tongue guy was Colin O'Riley.",224,11626
11626,3,5,Lily ,"Are you sure? Marshall: If it wasn't, I peed in the wrong guy's shampoo, man.",225,11627
11627,3,5,Blah-blah," (to Ted) You don't really believe that, do you? You swore it was Lily.",226,11628
11628,3,5,Ted ,I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa.,227,11629
11629,3,5,Blah-blah," Another girl, Ted? Who haven't you made out with? You know what, I don't need this. I design handbags. I'm writing a memoir. I'm a superstar. This is totally my year. Someday the name Blah-blah will be up in lights. Ted, next time you're online playing World of Warcraft, don't even think about chatting with me.",228,11630
11630,3,5,Barney ,World of Warcraft? The online role playing game? That's how you two met online?,229,11631
11631,3,5,Warrior Avatar, We should grab some coffee sometime...,230,11632
11632,3,5,Female Avatar," Yes, we should.",231,11633
11633,3,5,Warrior Avatar, What's your name?,232,11634
11634,3,5,Female Avatar, Ted. What's yours?,233,11635
11635,3,5,Ted ,"Yeah, it's really, it's a cool game.",234,11636
11636,3,5,Future Ted VO," So, suffice it to say, Blah-blah did not turn out to be your mother. As for the girl I made out with at the party...",235,11637
11637,3,5,Future Ted VO,"...there wasn't a doubt in my mind, that was your Aunt Lily.",236,11638
11638,3,5,Future Ted VO," But you know that magical story of how she and Uncle Marshall met, it was worth preserving, so I kept my mouth shut.",237,11639
11639,3,5,Ted ,I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa.,238,11640
11640,3,5,Future Ted VO, Until our 20th college reunion when I ran into Alexa Leskies.,239,11641
11641,3,5,Alexa ,"So, Ted, remember the last time we were here?",240,11642
11642,3,5,Ted ,You and me? No idea.,241,11643
11643,3,5,Alexa ,"Ted, come on. Freshman year, we were both pretty drunk?",242,11644
11644,3,5,Ted ,That was you?,243,11645
11645,3,5,,"(Ted rushes up from table) Ted: Lily, we never made out.",244,11646
11646,3,5,Lily ,I know.,245,11647
11647,3,5,Ted ,So I am not too-much-tongue guy.,246,11648
11648,3,5,Alexa ,Actually.,247,11649
11649,3,5,Ted ,No.,248,11650
11650,3,5,Marshall ,Look what I've confiscated from some kids.,249,11651
11651,3,5,Ted ,That is a fat sandwich.,250,11652

11653,3,5,Marshall ,"Chew chew chew chew, swallow.",252,11654

11655,3,5,Lily ,Sandwiches are strong these days.,254,11656
11656,3,5,Ted ,I can't believe I used to be able to eat a whole sandwich by myself. Now it's like two bites and I am done.,255,11657
11657,3,5,Marshall ,"Baby, can we grow sandwiches behind the garage?",256,11658
11658,3,5,Lily ,"Dude, we're 42.",257,11659
11659,3,5,Ted ,Where's my wife?,258,11660

11668,3,6,Barney ,I just find a porno starring Ted Mosby!,9,11669
11669,3,6,Ted ,What are you... What you're talking about?,10,11670
11670,3,6,Barney ,"I'm talking about welcome to the s*x plane, and look who plays the navigator, Ted Mosby (He shows a porno dvd)",11,11671
11671,3,6,Ted ,"Oh, it's the same exact spelling as my name.",12,11672
11672,3,6,Marshall ,"Okay, you know, cute coincidence, Barney. Whatever. I just got on the phone with the NR...",13,11673
11673,3,6,Ted ,Oh my God. This totally explains the thing at my doctor's the other day.,14,11674
11674,3,6,,"[Flashback - At the doctor's - Ted/Ted doctor's]The doctor: Open wide. I guess you're more used to saying that hearing it, huh, Ted Mosby?",15,11675
11675,3,6,,[End Flashback]Ted: Who is this guy? And why my doctor watching p*rn?,16,11676
11676,3,6,Barney ,All right. Let's meet your new doppelganger. Or should I say doppel banger.,17,11677
11677,3,6,Marshall ,"Guys, guys, guys! Can I tell my news? It's pretty...",18,11678
11678,3,6,Ted ,This is really bizarre. The only other famous Mosby I know was a confederate general during the civil war.,19,11679
11679,3,6,Barney ,Probably not the same guy.,20,11680
11680,3,6,Marshall (yelling) ,I got the job at the NRDC.,21,11681
11681,3,6,Ted ,"You got the job! Oh, yeah!",22,11682

11687,3,6,Ted ,"Uh, no. No, navigators have three stripes on their hats. Captains have four. That guy's a captain.",28,11688
11688,3,6,Barney ,"Yeah, and I'm sure complete accuracy in all those details was very important to the directors... ""Dirt and skank, the raunch brothers"".",29,11689

12090,3,9,,"Ted from 2030: I should explain. Kids, you remember the slap bet a year earlier, Marshall made a bet with Barney and won the right to slap him five times. He had already used the first and the second. But Marshall had something special in store for the third.",41,12091
12091,3,9,,"Marshall, on the phone with Barney: slapcountdown.com.",42,12092
12092,3,9,Barney ,no.,43,12093

12102,3,9,Barney ,"That's not allowed. Lily, you're the slap bet commissioner, is that allowed?",53,12103
12103,3,9,Lily ,"The hostess in me who's using her wedding china for the first time wants to say hell, no, but yeah, I 'm going to allow it.",54,12104

12106,3,9,,"Barney:...at your place, then you failed. Truth is, I'm not scared.",57,12107
12107,3,9,Marhall ,Really?,58,12108
12108,3,9,Barney ,"Right. Cause you blew it. The worst part about getting slapped is not knowing when it's going to happen. But now I know exactly when I'm gonna get slapped. So, you took all the suspense out. You showed your hand.",59,12109
12109,3,9,Marshall ,"And thursday at 3:01 p.m., your face is going to show my hand.",60,12110

12115,3,9,Robin ,Hi.,66,12116
12116,3,9,,Ted from 2030: But when your ex is dating someone new your mind tends to accentuate their flaws. This is how I saw bob.,67,12117
12117,3,9,Bob ,"Hey, dudes,what's crackin'?.",68,12118
12118,3,9,Ted ,"Hey, man, how are you?",69,12119

12147,3,9,Barney ,"Yeah, I'll be there, absolutely.",98,12148
12148,3,9,Ted ,"Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver. It's still kind of weird being alone with Robin, but if you were here...",99,12149
12149,3,9,Barney ,"Hey, say no more. I mean, when I pulled you out of that burning wreckage, I wasn't doing it to have a battleship named after me. But if you insist, yes, I'll be there for the christening.",100,12150
12150,3,9,Ted ,"You're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?",101,12151
12151,3,9,Barney ,"No, I'm not going to wear the medal of honor. That would just be tacky.",102,12152
12152,3,9,Ted ,So you're not coming to make pies.,103,12153
12153,3,9,Barney ,"No, no. Thank you, mr. President. (He hungs up) Sorry.",104,12154

12155,3,9,Lily ,"Oh, marshall, are you working on the cranberry sauce?",106,12156
12156,3,9,Marshall ,"In a minute, baby. I've only got so many hands. You see what I got going on here? They're turkeys, but they're also hands, because later, we're going to eat turkey... and then i'm going to slap you in your face.",107,12157
12157,3,9,Barney ,"Please, you took out all the suspense. In a horror movie, the killer does not grab a bullhorn and announce, ""Attention unsupervised teens here at the lake house: at precisely 3:00 a.m., I'm gonna jump out of that closet right there and hack you all up with a machete. P.S. fire is my one weakness.""",108,12158

12166,3,9,Marshall ,What do you mean something weird happened last night?,117,12167
12167,3,9,Ted ,"You may not realize this, but since we broke up, Robin and I have never really been alone together.",118,12168
12168,3,9,Ted ,"So we're in the kitchen, starting on the pies, and we realize, we don't have a damn thing to say to each other.",119,12169
12169,3,9,Ted ,"I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now. You just feel like everything you say is gonna make things worse.",120,12170
12170,3,9,Barney ,"Exactly. And you know why? Because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about, especially around the holidays. I mean, what decent human being would want to cause any kind of emotional or physical pain...",121,12171
12171,3,9,Marshall ,You're still getting slapped.,122,12172
12172,3,9,Ted ,"I wanted to leave, but i couldn't stick her with making all the pies by herself. She was exhausted.",123,12173
12173,3,9,Robin ,I yawned like a million times trying to get him to leave.,124,12174
12174,3,9,Lily ,"Yeah, some people just can't take a hint. By the way, I'm really swamped in here.",125,12175
12175,3,9,Robin ,I kept looking at the clock and sighing... totally clueless.,126,12176
12176,3,9,Lily ,"Uh-huh. I'm not sure I have time to mash those potatoes, you're standing right next to.",127,12177
12177,3,9,Robin ,And then Ted does the thing that he always does when there's an awkward silence.,128,12178
12178,3,9,Lily ,"Yep. masher's right there, next to the pot.",129,12179
12179,3,9,Robin ,He panics and says the first thing that pops into his head.,130,12180
12180,3,9,Robin ,"Hey, did you know that the first pies in recorded history came from Ancient Egypt?",131,12181
12181,3,9,Ted ,"Remember last year's Thanksgiving, when we had s*x seven times?",132,12182
12182,3,9,Barney ,Ooh. terrible.,133,12183
12183,3,9,Ted ,What?! I thought it would break the ice.,134,12184
12184,3,9,Robin ,I'd already broken the ice with my cool pie fact. then he makes it ten times more awkward.,135,12185
12185,3,9,Lily ,How do you respond to something like that?,136,12186
12186,3,9,Robin ,Did you know that the egyptian pyramids can be seen from space? Probably?,137,12187
12187,3,9,Ted ,"Ooh, the oven's pre-heated!",138,12188
12188,3,9,Robin ,"Okay, um... the pecan pie is gonna take the longest. Why don't we put that one in first?",139,12189
12189,3,9,Ted ,Pecan pie? Why are we making that?,140,12190
12190,3,9,Robin ,"Um, it's my favorite.",141,12191
12191,3,9,Ted ,You're allergic.,142,12192
12192,3,9,Robin ,I know. I just like smelling it. It's like eating with your nose.,143,12193
12193,3,9,Ted ,So we're making a pie for Bob.,144,12194
12194,3,9,Robin ,Yeah.,145,12195
12195,3,9,Barney ,She's got you making pies for this guy?,146,12196
12196,3,9,Ted ,Yeah.,147,12197
12197,3,9,Marshall ,That is a real slap in the face.,148,12198
12198,3,9,Ted ,"You know, you could have just told me it was for Bob.",149,12199
12199,3,9,Robin ,"Yeah, I-I just thought it might upset you.",150,12200
12200,3,9,Ted ,Upset me? Wait a second. Do you think that......Do you think that I'm jealous of Bob?,151,12201
12201,3,9,Robin ,I don't know. Is it so ridiculous to think that you might be?,152,12202
12202,3,9,Ted ,Yes.,153,12203
12203,3,9,Robin ,Why?,154,12204
12204,3,9,Ted ,Because he's a thousand years old.,155,12205
12205,3,9,Lily ,"No, Ted! What are you doing?",156,12206
12206,3,9,Robin ,Right?,157,12207
12207,3,9,Ted ,"The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that we can only talk about the first Thanksgiving,",158,12208
12208,3,9,Robin ,Come on.,159,12209
12209,3,9,Ted ,The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is because I heard noah gave him shotgun in the ark.,160,12210
12210,3,9,Robin ,Ted...,161,12211
12211,3,9,Ted ,"The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that I'm just an architect, but he discovered fire. How do you top that?",162,12212
12212,3,9,Robin ,He's 41! Why are you bashing on him so hard?,163,12213
12213,3,9,Ted ,I'm not. I'm just joking around. That's what friends do.,164,12214
12214,3,9,Robin ,It's mean.,165,12215
12215,3,9,Ted ,"Well, how come we're all allowed to bust on barney when he dates some skanktron, but when you sleep with the crypt keeper's dad, I'm not allowed to say a word?",166,12216
12216,3,9,Robin ,"First of all, Bob and I are not sleeping together. We're just dating. Secondly, have I said one word about the parade of dubious conquests you've been marching past me the last few months? One of whom got you a butterfly tattoo?",167,12217
12217,3,9,Ted ,"Hey, that is...",168,12218
12218,3,9,Robin ,And if you and I are such good friends... why is baking a pie for Bob so weird?,169,12219
12219,3,9,Ted ,"Yeah, if you and i are such good friends, why couldn't you just tell me that's what we were doing? Okay, maybe we should talk about this later. I-I should get going.",170,12220
12220,3,9,Robin ,"Well, what are we doing? It's Thanksgiving.",171,12221
12221,3,9,Ted ,I don't know. I'm sorry. This is stupid.,172,12222
12222,3,9,Robin ,"I'm sorry, too. Of course we're friends. I'm glad we're friends.",173,12223
12223,3,9,Ted ,"me, too.",174,12224
12224,3,9,,"Lily, Marshall and Barney: You guys slept together last night?",175,12225
12225,3,9,Lily ,That is a terrible idea!,176,12226
12226,3,9,Marshall ,Horrible idea.,177,12227
12227,3,9,Barney ,"Relapse five! That's where we high-five, then it's awkward for a little bit... and then we high-five again!",178,12228
12228,3,9,Lily ,What the hell were you doing? Let's review: you and Ted broke up six months ago. You're dating another man...,179,12229
12229,3,9,Robin ,"You are correct, Sir.",180,12230
12230,3,9,,Lily:...who's coming to my thanksgiving today...,181,12231
12231,3,9,Robin ,That is a truth-fact.,182,12232
12232,3,9,,Lily:...an event Ted is also attending.,183,12233
12233,3,9,Robin ,kablammo.,184,12234
12234,3,9,Lily ,Why are you trying to destroy American Thanksgiving?!,185,12235
12235,3,9,Robin ,"Oh, Lily, it's not as bad as it sounds. Bob and I aren't that serious, and what happened last night with Ted was a fluke.",186,12236
12236,3,9,Lily ,"Well, did you guys at least talk about it?",187,12237
12237,3,9,,Ted:: There's office material...,188,12238
12238,3,9,Robin ,I hear something burning...,189,12239
12239,3,9,Ted ,"Clearly, we need to ignore this.",190,12240
12240,3,9,Robin ,"Clearly, we need to talk about this.",191,12241
12241,3,9,Ted and Robin, You know? to save the friendship.,192,12242
12242,3,9,Robin ,We need to talk.,193,12243
12243,3,9,Ted ,Stuffed mushroom?,194,12244
12244,3,9,Robin ,We need to talk about last night.,195,12245
12245,3,9,Ted ,Did you know that some mushrooms are carnivorous? Probably... not?,196,12246
12246,3,9,Robin ,"Ted, can we please just deal with this? Look, I'm not mad. I just think...",197,12247
12247,3,9,Ted ,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. why would you be mad... you started it?",198,12248
12248,3,9,Robin ,What?! you're crazy!,199,12249
12249,3,9,Ted ,"We called a truce, we hugged, and when I tried to pull away, you kept your hand on my neck.",200,12250
12250,3,9,Robin ,Only because your hand was still around my waist.,201,12251
12251,3,9,Ted ,"Oh, come on! You leaned into it.",202,12252
12252,3,9,Robin ,I... leaned into it?,203,12253
12253,3,9,Ted ,"Yeah. You're like the crappy kid in little league who knows he's not going to make contact, so he just...""Oops, I got hit by the pitch. Better take my base.""",204,12254
12254,3,9,Robin ,"Oh, that was you in little league, wasn't it?",205,12255
12255,3,9,Ted ,My on-base percentage was off the charts!,206,12256
12256,3,9,Marshall ,"Oh, no! The slap-petizers.",207,12257
12257,3,9,Lily ,"You know what? That's it! This is Thanksgiving. Solve this right now. And if you have s*x again, neither of you gets dessert! Oh, what the hell kind of Thanksgiving is this anyway?",208,12258
12258,3,9,Barney ,"Um, most Thanksgivings.",209,12259
12259,3,9,Marshall ,"Don't stress, baby. I'll try to find us something relaxing.",210,12260
12260,3,9,Lily ,"Thanks, baby. Ooh, some classical music, maybe.",211,12261
12261,3,9,Marshall ,"Oh, my! Look at that. That means we're in the final hour of the countdown.",212,12262
12262,3,9,Barney ,I'm not scared.,213,12263
12263,3,9,Marshall ,"Then why is your right cheek twitching? It's not... maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard, it reverberates back to the present, shattering the time-slap continuum.",214,12264
12264,3,9,Barney ,Please don't slap me.,215,12265
12265,3,9,Marshall ,"I'm sorry, what?",216,12266
12266,3,9,Barney ,"Oh, God! don't slap me again! I don't want to get slapped again, and the first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it! I don't like it one bit!",217,12267
12267,3,9,Marshall ,"I thought I ruined it by putting a clock on it, Barney?",218,12268
12268,3,9,Barney ,"Well, you didn't ruin it; you made it so much worse! I can't eat. I can't sleep. I've lost ten pounds; my suits are wearing me. You know what? I'm outta here.",219,12269
12269,3,9,Marshall ,"Well, no, no, no. you can't leave.",220,12270
12270,3,9,Barney ,"Why can't I?! Nowhere in the rules does it say that I have to sit through sort of mental torture! You are allowed to slap my face, Sir, but you are not allowed to slap my mind! Good day!",221,12271
12271,3,9,Marshall ,But it's Slapsgiving.,222,12272
12272,3,9,Lily ,"No! It's not! It's Thanksgiving! Our first one as a married couple, as grownups and you're not even trying to be a part of it! None of you are! So... as slap bet commissioner, I'm issuing a ruling. Thanksgiving is a day of peace. There will be no slaps today!",223,12273

12279,3,9,Bob ,"Not too grownup. I made jell-o shots. We're gonna get silly, bitches.",230,12280
12280,3,9,Robin ,"Look at us! We can't be alone together, can we?",231,12281
12281,3,9,Ted ,Apparently not.,232,12282
12282,3,9,Robin ,What does that mean? We're supposed to be friends.,233,12283
12283,3,9,Ted ,"We aren't friends, are we? Not really. We avoid each other. We smile politely. We're two people who pretend to be friends because it would be inconvenient not to.",234,12284
12284,3,9,Robin ,"Well, maybe we should stop pretending.",235,12285
12285,3,9,Ted ,Maybe we should.,236,12286
12286,3,9,Robin ,So... what do we do now?,237,12287
12287,3,9,Ted ,I suppose... we eat dinner. And then that's it.,238,12288

12294,3,9,Marshall ,"Well, then, I'd like to say something. If that's cool? Um... today, Lily did something great.

12351,3,11,Barney ,"good, then we've got a solid half hour. And in that time, we will convince you not to set foot out that door. It's a story older than time, my friend, and it always plays out in the same eight steps. Step 1: Attraction.",28,12352

12369,3,11,Barney (off voice) ,The attraction is instant and undeniable.,46,12370
12370,3,11,Barney ,"But you know better. You've seen your friends make the same mistakes before. You've laughed smugly at them.(laughs) Idiots! But still, you think, ""this is different. The platinum rule doesn't apply to me."" And that step 2! Bargaining.",47,12371

12486,3,11,Lily ,"Every time we step out the door, they're out there waiting for us. Sometimes, we'll send Ted out first as a scout. Nobody's there. Then we'll go out one second later, and there they are.",163,12487
12487,3,11,Marshall ,It's freakin' supernatural. Are they ghosts? Can only we see them?,164,12488

12495,3,11,Ted ,"You've got a whole meat locker at home full of corpses, don't you?",172,12496
12496,3,11,Barney ,"Now look at me. Declawed. Neutered. What was once my jungle is now my zoo and i am forced to mate with the same old lioness again, and again, and again while families pay to watch.",173,12497
12497,3,11,Ted ,"yeah, this metaphor's really falling apart.",174,12498

12501,3,11,Marshall ,don't k*ll the bar dude.,178,12502
12502,3,11,Barney ,"And so, inevitably, you have to do the thing you've been dreading all along. Now, a relationship-ectomy is a delicate surgery as it is, but in the case of the platinum rule, it takes a very, very steady hand, and that's step 7: CONFRONTATION.",179,12503
12503,3,11,Robin ,"Curt, we need to talk. I like you...",180,12504
12504,3,11,Marshall ,"guys, we like you a lot...",181,12505

12507,3,11,Lily ,We're getting a little sick of charades.,184,12508
12508,3,11,Barney ,"I mean, i don't like you that way. I used to like you that way but now that i've seen everything there is to see, i don't know, i kind of want to see those same parts just on other girls.",185,12509
12509,3,11,Robin ,So maybe we could go back to just being coworkers.,186,12510
12510,3,11,Marshall ,Maybe we should just go back to being neighbors.,187,12511
12511,3,11,Barney ,"other girls and you, if you're into that but the other girls have to be there, too. That's the important part.",188,12512
12512,3,11,Wendy ,"Gosh, you're just terrified of ever getting close to anyone, aren't you?",189,12513
12513,3,11,Barney ,or that. Let's say it's that. So can i get a gin and tonic?,190,12514
12514,3,11,Barney ,"And in any other relationship, that would be it. End of story. But because you have to see this person again, there's a step 8: FALLOUT.",191,12515

12517,3,11,Robin ,"Uh, well, their perimeter sh**ting has been a little bit off this season...",194,12518
12518,3,11,Curt ,"The knicks lost because they were afraid of getting hurt. So they didn't even try. Well, you know what i think? I think the knicks didn't deserve my love to begin with. Kincks suck! (He gets out, on tears)",195,12519
12519,3,11,Robin ,And that's sports.,196,12520

12523,3,11,Marshall ,That was close.,200,12524
12524,3,11,Lily ,Too close. (Someone knocks on the door) You've got to be kidding me. What do we do?,201,12525

12534,3,11,Barney ,Thanks Wendy. Of course we can.,211,12535
12535,3,11,Wendy ,"If you need anything else, let me know.",212,12536

12538,3,11,Ted ,What? You're being ridiculous.,215,12539
12539,3,11,Barney ,Yours is poisoned too. She's trying to k*ll me and everyone close to me.,216,12540
12540,3,11,Ted ,What are you talking about?,217,12541
12541,3,11,Barney ,"Ted! Look at the facts. I dump her and she says ""no hard feelings"". She's a psycho! What other explanation is there?",218,12542
12542,3,11,Ted ,"Uh, that you're letting yourself believe she's crazy so you don't have to face the far more likely possibility that she doesn't want to date you either?",219,12543
12543,3,11,Barney ,Where did Marshall get that hamburger?,220,12544
12544,3,11,Ted ,"I don't know, i guess Wendy the Waitress brought it to him.",221,12545

12547,3,11,Barney ,You're welcome.,224,12548
12548,3,11,Robin ,"Wait a second. You've been sitting here, pretending to be the expert on all this, but the truth is, this was no real fallout from your breakup at all?",225,12549
12549,3,11,Barney ,Yet.,226,12550
12550,3,11,Robin ,You're an idiot.,227,12551

12554,3,11,Ted ,You're such a jerk!,231,12555
12555,3,11,Barney ,"Ted, have you not been listening? Attraction, bargaining, submission, perks, tipping point, purgatory, confrontation, fallout! These things will all happen to you as surely as they happened to all of us! It's a rule of nature.",232,12556
12556,3,11,Ted ,"Well, i'm sick of all the rules! There's too many of them! The hot/crazy scale, the lemon law, the platinum rule! If everyone in the world followed every one of your rules, the human race would cease to exist. Yes chances are to Stella and I are not going to live happily ever after the overwhelming odds have it ending badly. And when that happens, it'll be for one of a million possible reasons. But that doesn't mean i'm not gonna try. And when it does fail, so help me god, it's not gonna be because of some rule. (He watches himself in th mirror) PS: you just made my hair look awesome. Good night. (He leaves)",233,12557

12559,3,11,Ted ,She thought we were seeing a movie just as friends.,236,12560
12560,3,11,Marshall ,Why would she think that?,237,12561
12561,3,11,Robin ,Did she see your tattoo and assume you were gay?,238,12562
12562,3,11,Ted ,"Apparently, there's a rule that says i can't date Stella.",239,12563
12563,3,11,Barney ,"Exactly, the platinum rule. Stella reads my blog.",240,12564
12564,3,11,Ted ,"No, this rule comes from the american medical association. Doctors aren't legally allowed to date their patients.",241,12565
12565,3,11,Lily ,"Oh, sorry Ted.",242,12566
12566,3,11,Ted ,It's okay. What are you guys watching?,243,12567
12567,3,11,Narrator ,"So that was the end of the story between me and Stella, at least for the time being. But i don't know, looking back on the platinum rule, i think there's a ninth step. We'll call it coexistence. It's the moment you realize that all that anger and resentment just isn't useful.",244,12568
12568,3,11,Robin ,Thanks for watching.,245,12569
12569,3,11,Curt ,Good night.,246,12570

12580,3,13,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, sometimes in life you see someone and you just instantly know this is the person for you. It can happen anywhere. Even the waiting room of a tattoo removal clinic. And that's what happened when I met..Stella.",1,12581
12581,3,13,Stella ,"Ah, the butterfly tramp stamp. My bread and butter. So I'm guessing that the real story involves a bad breakup and some booze. Unless it's a gang tattoo, in which case, I think it's time to find a new gang.",2,12582

13074,3,14,Marshall ,I don't know what to do with my hands. What do I normally do with my hands? (Barney joins them at the booth) Barney. I brought a copy of the bracket. Which one is she?,200,13075
13075,3,14,Barney ,I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64.,201,13076
13076,3,14,Marshall ,Not even on bracket. Cinderella story comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing. That'll warm your heart.,202,13077
13077,3,14,Ted ,Are you okay?,203,13078
13078,3,14,Barney ,"I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize.",204,13079
13079,3,14,Lily ,"Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry.",205,13080
13080,3,14,Barney ,What? What?,206,13081
13081,3,14,Robin ,"Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other.",207,13082
13082,3,14,Barney ,So I apologized for nothing?,208,13083
13083,3,14,Lily ,"Yes, but it was a great apology. And a perfect way to end my scrapbook. I'm going to call this photo ""Barney's Redemption."" Could you stop giving me the finger?",209,13084
13084,3,14,,"Ted from 2030: Eventually, Barney did figure out who the mysterious girl was. But we on that later.",210,13085
13085,3,14,Woman ,"Barney, come back to bed. You have a shuttle launch tomorrow. And that asteroid that's headed for Manhattan, It's not gonna destroy itself.",211,13086
13086,3,15,,"Ted from 2030: Kids,the spring of 2008 was a pretty great time for me. Stella and I had started dating, and I'd just gotten a big raise at work. So I decided to purchase something I knew would be the envy of all my friends.",1,13087
13087,3,15,Ted ,A new car!,2,13088
13088,3,15,Barney ,"Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity!",3,13089
13089,3,15,Robin ,You can't call shotgun for eternity.,4,13090
13090,3,15,Barney ,I just called it.,5,13091
13091,3,15,Robin ,"You can't just call things, barney.",6,13092
13092,3,15,Barney ,I call that I can call things!,7,13093

13096,3,15,Marshall ,Beer.,11,13097
13097,3,15,Ted ,"Okay, what happened?",12,13098
13098,3,15,Marshall ,They always told me that working at a big law firm was like being at war...,13,13099
13099,3,15,,"Marshall:...You get out of law school, it's like getting out of boot camp. That first day at work, you're storming the beaches, full of piss and vinegar...",14,13100
13100,3,15,Man ,"Dude, we're lawyers now.",15,13101
13101,3,15,Marshall ,Totally.,16,13102
13102,3,15,Man ,We've got briefcases and everything.,17,13103

13106,3,15,Man ,Candy bars.,21,13107
13107,3,15,Marshall ,Then you get in the trenches side by side with your buddies. And you feel a sense of camaraderie. But before too long...,22,13108
13108,3,15,Arthur ,"Hey, Marshall....",23,13109
13109,3,15,,"Marshall:...the shells start to fall. Hello, Arthur.",24,13110
13110,3,15,Marshall ,"Arthur Hobbes is one of the senior partners at my firm, and he's... he's my boss. He seems like a nice guy, but he's got a nickname... Artillery arthur.",25,13111
13111,3,15,Arthur ,How's your morning going?,26,13112
13112,3,15,Marshall ,It's going fine. How is yours?,27,13113
13113,3,15,Arthur ,"Not too bad, not too bad. Hey, is Ferguson in yet?",28,13114
13114,3,15,Marshall ,"He is, he's in... just in his office next door.",29,13115
13115,3,15,Arthur ,"That's great... have a good one, buddy.",30,13116
13116,3,15,Marshall ,"You, too. (Arthur leaves Marshall's office) You never know who's gonna get hit...",31,13117
13117,3,15,Arthur ,"Hey, Ferguson! I read your report, and it's complete crap! No, you know what? That's an insult to crap. If crap could eat and then crap stuff out, it's that! Your report is the crap that crap craps! If you last two more days here, I'll be shocked! Shocked!",32,13118
13118,3,15,Marshall ,"It was brutal, But the worst was a few minutes later.",33,13119
13119,3,15,Ferguson ,Did you hear that?,34,13120
13120,3,15,Marshall ,"Yeah, sorry.",35,13121
13121,3,15,Ferguson ,"Can you believe he did that On ""Take-your-daughter-to-work"" day?",36,13122
13122,3,15,Marshall ,"So that brings us to today. A little background. So I'm working on this report called ""Using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent to contest a class certification order based on a lack of commonality, numerosity...""",37,13123
13123,3,15,Ted ,"Dude, you lost us. Can't you just call it something cool like ""the ninja report""?",38,13124
13124,3,15,Marshall ,"Okay. yeah, fine, whatever. Um, so I'm supposed to turn in ""the ninja report"" yesterday. But I got insanely busy with other stuff, I didn't get a chance to finish it, and then this morning...",39,13125
13125,3,15,Arthur ,"Hey, Ferguson.",40,13126
13126,3,15,Ferguson ,"Hey, Arthur.",41,13127
13127,3,15,Arthur ,How's your day going?,42,13128
13128,3,15,Marshall ,I gotta go.,43,13129
13129,3,15,Ferguson ,Great. how is yours?,44,13130
13130,3,15,Arthur ,"Great, great... Hey, is Marshall in yet?",45,13131

13132,3,15,Arthur ,"Fantastic. have a good one, buddy.",47,13133
13133,3,15,Marshall ,And then...,48,13134
13134,3,15,Marshall ,He screamed at me.,49,13135
13135,3,15,Lily ,"Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.",50,13136
13136,3,15,Barney ,"What, that's it? You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?",51,13137
13137,3,15,Marshall ,"Barney, I have never been screamed at like that in my life.",52,13138
13138,3,15,Ted ,"Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?",53,13139
13139,3,15,Barney ,"I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business.",54,13140
13140,3,15,Lily ,"Oh, baby, it's just not fair. You've been working so hard. Late nights, weekends. I never see you. We've barely made love in weeks. It's bad, guys, mama needs her sugar.",55,13141
13141,3,15,Robin ,"Look, Marshall, he screamed at you, you took it. He probably respects you more for it.",56,13142
13142,3,15,Marshall ,"Yeah, about that... So Arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment... Face turning red, vein in his forehead about to burst, spittle flying like shrapnel. Everyone you work with walking by your office, peering in. And suddenly, I just felt all of it.",57,13143
13143,3,15,Ted ,All of what?,58,13144
13144,3,15,Marshall ,"All of it. The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment, and now I'm working for the bad guys instead. The fact that I am stuck in this job because of a mortgage I can barely afford on an apartment that is crooked. The fact that I am a grown man, and nobody, not even Artillery Arthur, has the right to talk to me like that!",59,13145
13145,3,15,Marshall ,I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...,60,13146
13146,3,15,Barney ,"Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car.",61,13147
13147,3,15,Barney ,Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.,62,13148
13148,3,15,Marshall ,"I don't know what happened. There's just something about being yelled at like that, like I was being scolded by my dad. Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.",63,13149
13149,3,15,Robin ,"Is ""boy"" the right word?",64,13150
13150,3,15,Marshall ,"I felt absolutely powerless. Flaccid... Hell, I... I felt castrated.",65,13151
13151,3,15,Lily ,"God, you're hot right now.",66,13152
13152,3,15,Marshall ,"And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report.",67,13153
13153,3,15,Barney ,Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.,68,13154
13154,3,15,Marshall ,How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?,69,13155
13155,3,15,Robin ,Here's what I would do if I were you.,70,13156
13156,3,15,Robin ,"Hi, Arthur.",71,13157
13157,3,15,Arthur ,"Hello, Marshall. Have you finally finished the ninja report?",72,13158
13158,3,15,Robin ,"Yeah, I got it. Right here. I think it's gonna blow you away.",73,13159
13159,3,15,Arthur ,"Please, I have a family.",74,13160
13160,3,15,Robin ,So we good?,75,13161
13161,3,15,Arthur ,We're so good.,76,13162
13162,3,15,Robin ,Then why are you still in my office?,77,13163
13163,3,15,Ted ,"Okay, g*n violence might be the answer to everything up in Canada, Robin, but here in America, we solve our problems with words. Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy with a big eloquent speech defending human dignity. Like abraham Lincoln.",78,13164
13164,3,15,Marshall ,"Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big, eloquent speech off the top of your head.",79,13165
13165,3,15,Ted ,Observe.,80,13166
13166,3,15,Ted ,Arthur?,81,13167
13167,3,15,Arthur ,"What do you want, Marshall?",82,13168
13168,3,15,Ted ,"Justice, sir. You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights, the most fundamentally paramount of which is the right... Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount. One means highest, one means lowest.",83,13169
13169,3,15,Arthur ,You are nailing this.,84,13170
13170,3,15,Ted ,"Human beings have rights, and those rights are, um...",85,13171
13171,3,15,Arthur ,"You got me hooked, reel me in.",86,13172
13172,3,15,Ted ,There are certain justices that cannot or will not be inalienable... as such... for the future.,87,13173
13173,3,15,Arthur ,Stuck the landing... bravo! Thank you. Security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.,88,13174
13174,3,15,Marshall ,"Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay? I can't have some big confrontation with Arthur. I need this job, i... I need the money.",89,13175
13175,3,15,Ted ,"Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow, tell him off and then quit?",90,13176
13176,3,15,Marshall ,"It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it.",91,13177
13177,3,15,Barney ,"Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.",92,13178
13178,3,15,Barney ,"Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened.",93,13179
13179,3,15,Bilson ,"You made yourself look bad, you made this company look bad, and quite frankly, you made our friends, the North Koreans, look bad! And I'll tell you something else, Blauman, if you think for one moment...",94,13180
13180,3,15,Blauman ,"You know what, Bilson? You can kiss my ass.",95,13181
13181,3,15,Barney ,"Oh, snap.",96,13182
13182,3,15,Bilson ,What?,97,13183
13183,3,15,Blauman ,"You heard me. I don't need to take your crap anymore. My cousin's website went public today, and I made a pile of money on the ipo, so you know what I think Of this whole damn company?",98,13184
13184,3,15,Ted ,"Oh, my God.",99,13185
13185,3,15,Marshall ,He peed on the conference table?,100,13186
13186,3,15,Blauman ,"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second till I get started? Come on. Come on.",101,13187
13187,3,15,,"Barney, pouring some water in a glass: Does this help?",102,13188
13188,3,15,Barney ,"Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website tanked. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.",103,13189
13189,3,15,Marshall ,That's it? that's the end of the story?,104,13190
13190,3,15,Barney ,"No, no, of course not... he died.",105,13191
13191,3,15,Marshall ,"How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?",106,13192
13192,3,15,Barney ,"Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming.",107,13193
13193,3,15,Marshall ,Chain of screaming?,108,13194
13194,3,15,Barney ,"Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.",109,13195
13195,3,15,Ted ,I thought it was a chain of screaming.,110,13196
13196,3,15,Barney ,"It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle.",111,13197
13197,3,15,Marshall ,I don't scream at Lily.,112,13198
13198,3,15,Lily ,"And I don't scream at my kids, none of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.",113,13199
13199,3,15,Robin ,So it's not a circle.,114,13200
13200,3,15,Barney ,"Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?",115,13201
13201,3,15,Marshall ,"Lily, I need your take on this. What... what should I do?",116,13202
13202,3,15,Lily ,"Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...",117,13203
13203,3,15,Barney ,"Oh, God.",118,13204
13204,3,15,,"Lily:...When dealing with a bully, the most important thing is to be constructive and positive.",119,13205

13206,3,15,Arthur ,"Hello, Marshall.",121,13207
13207,3,15,Lily ,"I have the ninja report right here. But Arthur, in the future, if you want someone to do their best work, try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation, but through encouragement, inspiration and respect.",122,13208
13208,3,15,Arthur ,"Well said, Marshall, I needed to hear that. By the way, I saw your wife's picture in your office. That is one tasty slice.",123,13209
13209,3,15,Lily ,"Oh, you're damn right. You know what I'm gonna do when I get home?",124,13210
13210,3,15,Arthur ,"Oh, yeah.",125,13211
13211,3,15,Lily ,I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...,126,13212
13212,3,15,Arthur ,That's it.,127,13213
13213,3,15,,Lily:...just throw her on the bed...,128,13214
13214,3,15,Arthur ,That's where she belongs.,129,13215
13215,3,15,,Lily:...and drive her home like a pack of sled dogs!,130,13216
13216,3,15,Lily ,"It's bad, guys. Mama needs it bad.",131,13217
13217,3,15,Marshall ,"You're right, baby, it's about respect. That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight. Can you give me that speech again?",132,13218
13218,3,15,Lily ,I'm gonna drive her home like a pack of...,133,13219
13219,3,15,,"Marshall:No, the other part, please.",134,13220

13221,3,15,,"Ted from 2030: And it seemed like that was the end of it, but it wasn't, because the next night...",136,13222
13222,3,15,Lily ,"Which of these carpets would look better in the new apartment? I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft. It would feel great on your bare feet......or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat rolling down your trembling bosom.",137,13223
13223,3,15,Ted ,"Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?",138,13224
13224,3,15,Marshall ,"Shh, don't say my name. Lily can't know it's me. Just pretend you're talking to Stella. Be all lovey dovey.",139,13225
13225,3,15,Ted ,"Hey, Stella. Sweetie, how's it going?",140,13226
13226,3,15,Marshall ,"Not good, not good at all.",141,13227

13234,3,15,Lily ,You hitting that?,149,13235
13235,3,15,Marshall ,"I'm in trouble, Ted. Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.",150,13236
13236,3,15,Ted ,"Um... it's a new car, so just be careful...",151,13237

13240,3,15,Ted ,"Look, just tell me what happened first.",155,13241
13241,3,15,Marshall ,"Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech that Lily told me to give, be firm but respectful? Well, it didn't totally go that way.",156,13242
13242,3,15,Ted ,"There is a lot of ketchup on that burger. Sorry, what happened?",157,13243
13243,3,15,Marshall ,"After we all finished talking last night, I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.",158,13244

13256,3,15,Barney ,"Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.",171,13257
13257,3,15,Marshall ,Who would I even scream at?,172,13258
13258,3,15,Barney ,I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries.,173,13259

13308,3,15,Barney ,"No, I'm kidding... keep going.",223,13309
13309,3,15,Marshall ,"Bob Barker's not your father! You've concocted this delusional idea that a game show host is your real father, and he's not! You were abandoned, Barney! You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it, and so now you never allow yourself to feel anything, and that's how you survive in this corporate world, and if I keep heading down this path, I'm gonna turn into you!

13324,3,15,Marshall ,What?,239,13325
13325,3,15,Lily ,"Marshall, our future isn't money or an apartment. And it's definitely not you being miserable at that horrible job. I'm just happy to have my husband back. We'll figure the rest out.",240,13326

13488,3,16,Lily ,What's revertigo?,153,13489
13489,3,16,Ted ,"It's a stupid, made-up word with no meaning.",154,13490
13490,3,16,Marshall ,"No. It's a phenomenon where, when you're around people from your past, you start behaving like them.",155,13491
13491,3,16,Lily ,Oh. One example of that springs to mind. I think we all know what it is.,156,13492

13540,3,16,Robin ,"Um, can I make an observation?",205,13541
13541,3,16,Michelle ,"Oh. I know. Whenever I'm around Lily, she just brings out that side of me. There's a psychological term for the phenomenon.",206,13542
13542,3,16,Marshall ,Revertigo?,207,13543
13543,3,16,,"Michelle:No. Actually, it's associative regression. You see, the neural pathways that... Oh, no, you did not just put on my jam! Oh. Put your hands up, girl!",208,13544

13550,3,16,Robin ,"It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again.",215,13551
13551,3,16,Barney ,"Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome.",216,13552
13552,3,16,Robin ,"Right. Of course, the-the first being you.",217,13553

13557,3,16,Robin ,"Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?",222,13558
13558,3,16,Barney ,"Of course. So, should I just put it in?",223,13559
13559,3,16,Robin ,"Yeah, why not?",224,13560
13560,3,16,Robin ,"This was my big artistic follow-up to""Let's Go to the Mall."" It kind of tanked.",225,13561
13561,3,16,Barney ,Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more.,226,13562
13562,3,16,Robin ,"Oh, I'm so glad.",227,13563

13564,3,16,Robin ,Yeah.,229,13565
13565,3,16,Barney ,"You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then?",230,13566
13566,3,16,Robin ,"Yeah, you're right. I was lame.",231,13567
13567,3,16,Barney ,"Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad.",232,13568
13568,3,16,Robin ,He was my sidekick. He had to be.,233,13569
13569,3,16,,Ted from 2030: And so they watched it again... And again... And again. They watched it over and over that night until finally... (Robin and Barney kiss) they stopped watching.,234,13570
13570,3,17,,"Ted from 2030: Well, kids, here we are. We've arrived, my 30th birthday. The long-awaited story of...the goat. That week started just like any other. Barney woke up in some girl's bed.",1,13571
13571,3,17,Barney ,"In my experience, the way this normally goes is, we lie here for a while, make a little awkward chitchat.",2,13572
13572,3,17,Robin ,Check.,3,13573
13573,3,17,Barney ,"Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery, rocket test flight I've got to be at, slip out of the apartment and never call you again.",4,13574
13574,3,17,Robin ,"And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, ""who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?""",5,13575
13575,3,17,Barney ,"Actually, you usually say that out loud. So...I just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend",6,13576
13576,3,17,Robin ,And I just slept with my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.,7,13577
13577,3,17,Barney ,Best friend.,8,13578
13578,3,17,Robin ,"Okay, here's the deal, Barney. The second my feet touch the ground, this never happened.",9,13579
13579,3,17,Barney ,"Okay. Wait. Right click, save as... Into the.bpeg folder, and okay. This never happened. It's a good plan.",10,13580
13580,3,17,Robin ,Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.,11,13581
13581,3,17,Barney ,"Okay. Right. So, Robin?",12,13582
13582,3,17,Robin ,"Yes, Barney?",13,13583
13583,3,17,Barney ,Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?,14,13584
13584,3,17,Robin ,"I'm gonna shower... till June, and, um, since you were never here to begin with, you won't be here when I get out.",15,13585
13585,3,17,Barney ,Okay. This never happened. Never happened. Never... happened.,16,13586
13586,3,17,,Ted from 2030: But pretending it never happened wouldn't be that easy.,17,13587
13587,3,17,Ted ,"So, tell us, what was it like?",18,13588
13588,3,17,Barney ,What?,19,13589
13589,3,17,Ted ,"Penetrating that barrier. You and I are the first ones to hit it. Well, not the first ones, certainly, but the first ones at this table.",20,13590

13593,3,17,Marshall ,"Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts.",24,13594
13594,3,17,Lily ,"It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there. I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there.",25,13595
13595,3,17,Barney ,What are you talking about?!,26,13596
13596,3,17,Ted ,"The big three-oh. You know, my 30th birthday's this friday. Did you forget? What kind of friend is this guy?",27,13597
13597,3,17,Barney ,"Ha-ha right. A great friend, by the way. The best. Is it my imagination, or are these drinks getting smaller? If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, ""try again."" How you doing there, Robin?",28,13598
13598,3,17,Robin ,I'm good.,29,13599
13599,3,17,Ted ,"Oh, so, I made a a decision. I'm going to go through all my old stuff, And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore. Hmm. Barney, you want my xbox?",30,13600

13623,3,17,Barney ,A little.,54,13624
13624,3,17,Marshall ,I'll take it.,55,13625
13625,3,17,Marshall ,"Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say, this might be a little bit over my head. For one thing, I'm fairly certain that if these contracts aren't executed precisely, we will be at war with Portugal.",56,13626
13626,3,17,Barney ,"Forget that. That's a Tuesday for me. New shredder. This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds. From sky mall. It's all from sky mall. Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall. Want a hot dog?",57,13627

13636,3,17,Barney ,You can't. you can't tell anyone. Attorney-client privilege.,67,13637
13637,3,17,Marshall ,Why are you doing this to me?!,68,13638

13651,3,17,George ,So what if I did? There's no rule against it.,82,13652
13652,3,17,Benjamin ,"Well, there should be. There should be a set of rules that govern the way bros comport themselves among other bros.",83,13653
13653,3,17,George ,"But who shall write such a document? I have to go to Me, D.C.,and pose for the dollar bill.",84,13654

13662,3,17,Marshall ,"Yeah, because you slept with Robin.",93,13663
13663,3,17,Barney ,"No, that was awesome. I feel bad because the Bro Code clearly states ""No s*x with your bro's ex."" But if you, my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere, then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.",94,13664
13664,3,17,Marshall ,And you would pay me for that?,95,13665
13665,3,17,Barney ,"No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork. Technically, you'll be paid by a toy factory in Pyongyang.",96,13666
13666,3,17,Marshall ,"Barney, I'm no shrink, okay, but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?",97,13667
13667,3,17,Barney ,"Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation, I'd hire the guy we pay to hint notize us before depositions. Now, get cracking!",98,13668

13693,3,17,Robin ,"Ted is never finding out about this, you understand? Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything. And don't even think about opening that can until I'm out of the splash zone.",124,13694
13694,3,17,Barney ,"Fantastic, you're here. Give me the good news.",125,13695

13715,3,17,Marshall ,"Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it. The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong. And the only way you're ever gonna feel any better about it is if you tell Ted what you did.",146,13716

13842,3,18,Willie ,Hello?,46,13843
13843,3,18,Barney ,Hanging up on you once wasn't enough. (And then Barney hangs up),47,13844
13844,3,18,Stella ,"So I lanced this thing on this guy's back, and I'll be honest with you, I didn't even know what it was, and then it exploded like a volcano. Plus everywhere.",48,13845
13845,3,18,Ted ,"Let's have s*x. Right now, I'll lock the door.",49,13846
13846,3,18,Stella ,"Oh, there is no lock on that door.",50,13847

13849,3,18,Ted ,I'm sorry. We're waiting. It's cool.,53,13850
13850,3,18,Stella ,You've been so patient Ted. The truth is... I'm kind of nervous. I have a confession to make.,54,13851
13851,3,18,Ted ,I was afraid of this. You're 14.,55,13852
13852,3,18,Stella ,"No, um... it's kind of embarrassing, but it's been a while since I was intimate with anyone.",56,13853
13853,3,18,Ted ,Wow. It's funny that you say that. Me too.,57,13854
13854,3,18,Stella ,Really? How long it's been for you?,58,13855
13855,3,18,Ted ,It's been a while.,59,13856
13856,3,18,Stella ,Tell me.,60,13857
13857,3,18,Stella ,Me too!,61,13858
13858,3,18,Ted ,It's been five months for you too?,62,13859
13859,3,18,All (except Ted) ,Five years!!??,63,13860
13860,3,18,Marshall ,"Wow. Stella hasn't had s*x since 2003. Let's just put this in context. The last time Stella had s*x, the movie, Seabiscuit, had just galloped into the theaters... and our hearts.",64,13861
13861,3,18,Lily ,"Five years! God, if I even went one year, I would be out on the street selling it for a nickel.",65,13862
13862,3,18,Marshall ,"The last time Stella had s*x, the world was just learning about SARS.",66,13863
13863,3,18,Robin ,"Well, Ted, what else did she said? Did she gave you any kind of explanation?",67,13864
13864,3,18,Stella ,"Look, after Lucy was born, I dated a little, but it was hard to find a guy I could trust enough. Sooner or later, every one of them gave me a reason not to.",68,13865
13865,3,18,Ted ,But nobody in five years?,69,13866
13866,3,18,Stella ,"Look, Ted, guys regret the girls they didn't sleep with. Girls regret the guys they do sleep with. And for the past five years, I've had no regrets. Ted, you're staring at my boobs.",70,13867
13867,3,18,Ted ,"In my defense, they were staring at me.",71,13868
13868,3,18,Lily ,So what does this mean for you? Is she ever wanna want to get intimate?,72,13869
13869,3,18,Ted ,Actually...,73,13870
13870,3,18,Stella ,"But the truth is, I really do want to do this with you. I don't think I'd regret it at all.",74,13871
13871,3,18,Ted ,Your pillow talk's a little rusty.,75,13872
13872,3,18,Stella ,"You know what I mean Ted, I'm ready.",76,13873
13873,3,18,Ted ,"That's great. Like ""right now"" ready? (She laughs)",77,13874
13874,3,18,Ted ,"So, her sister's driving up to baby-sit Lucy, and we're getting a hotel room in the city Saturday night.",78,13875
13875,3,18,Marshall ,"The last time Stella had s*x, The Da Vinci Code had just come out.",79,13876
13876,3,18,Robin ,Well that's doesn't seem like that long ago.,80,13877
13877,3,18,Marshall ,"Not the movie, the book.",81,13878
13878,3,18,Robin ,Wow.,82,13879
13879,3,18,Ted ,"It's a lot of pressure, isn't it?",83,13880
13880,3,18,Lily ,You know what? It's not. This woman needs it bad. Anything you do is going to be fireworks. I remember my longest drought...,84,13881
13881,3,18,Lily ,(V.O.) It was that summer I lived in San Francisco. I hadn't had been with Marshall since two months and 19 days. (There is a shock. And Lily likes the sensation which that gets her.),85,13882
13882,3,18,Lily ,"Oh, San Francisco!",86,13883
13883,3,18,Ted ,"I don't know Lily, after five years, her expectations have gotta be pretty high.",87,13884
13884,3,18,Marshall (watching on Internet) ,Notable deaths in 2003... Oh my God... Nell Carter. Did you guys know that Nell Carter had died?,88,13885
13885,3,18,Ted ,I really gonna have to bring my A-game to satisfy this woman.,89,13886
13886,3,18,Robin ,"Yeah, it'll be pretty hard now that she's dead.",90,13887
13887,3,18,Ted ,Not Nell Carter... Stella.,91,13888
13888,3,18,Marshall ,"Dude, relax, it's all about expectations management. Do you know why I hated Jerry Maguire so much?",92,13889
13889,3,18,Ted ,Because you're dead inside?,93,13890
13890,3,18,Marshall ,"No, because you built it up for, like, two weeks, saying it was the greatest movie ever. With Stella, do the opposite: lower expectations.",94,13891
13891,3,18,Ted ,"Right, right, and then no matter what happens, she'll be happy.",95,13892
13892,3,18,Marshall (in the phone) ,"Hey, buddy. I'm married, Barney, I cannot be your new wingman. (Marshall hangs up, then Robin's phone rings, she picks up the phone and say directly...)",96,13893
13893,3,18,Robin ,No. (And hangs up),97,13894
13894,3,18,Barney ,"Hey, Randy. Could you come here for a minute? (Randy releases a box. And comes in Barney's office by running) Good news. I'm calling you up to the majors. Starting tomorrow night, how would you like to be my new wingman?",98,13895
13895,3,18,Randy ,"Uh... Just need to check my calendar. Be right back. (Then he goes in the lane, and dances. He comes back.) Tomorrow works.",99,13896
13896,3,18,Ted ,I have a surprise appetizer for us today. Check it out. Potato skins.,100,13897
13897,3,18,Stella ,Fancy?,101,13898
13898,3,18,Ted ,"Yeah. Right? God, it's been forever since I had potato skins. I remember them as being pretty much the most delicious things ever. (He eats the potato skin) Huh. That's surprising.",102,13899
13899,3,18,Stella ,What?,103,13900
13900,3,18,Ted ,"This potato skin. It's good but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head. Even though potato skin performed admirably, and is a totally respectable size... I couldn't enjoy it because of my own unrealistic expectations.",104,13901
13901,3,18,Stella ,"Hmm, Ted, I see what you're doing. You're trying to lower my expectations for tonight. Is this a lengh thing?",105,13902
13902,3,18,Ted ,No.,106,13903
13903,3,18,Stella ,Quick on the draw?,107,13904
13904,3,18,Ted ,No.,108,13905
13905,3,18,Stella ,Unexpected number of testicules?,109,13906
13906,3,18,Ted ,"No. It's just that this is a big deal for you. I mean, it's like your virginity: the sequel. (She laughs)",110,13907
13907,3,18,Stella ,Virginity 2: Eletric Boogaloo?,111,13908
13908,3,18,Ted ,"Exactly, and I don't want to mess it up. I don't want you to ever wonder if was worth it.",112,13909
13909,3,18,Stella ,"Oh Ted, of course it's gonna be worth it. Stop worrying. It's you and me. It already has everything it needs. (They kiss each other)",113,13910
13910,3,18,Ted ,"""Unexpected number of testicules?""",114,13911
13911,3,18,Stella ,It happens. I knew a guy in med school... we used to joke that we was one ball away from getting walked. (They laugh),115,13912
13912,3,18,Barney ,Hey.,116,13913
13913,3,18,Randy ,What up bro-seph Lieberman?,117,13914
13914,3,18,Barney ,"No, uh-uh. Randy, we never use the word ""bro"" in the name of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate.",118,13915
13915,3,18,Randy ,"(He takes out his memo pad) Goodbye ""Geraldine Ferrar-bro"".",119,13916
13916,3,18,Barney ,"You know what? I'm excited about this, Randy. You will be my next masterpiece. It's like with Ted. When I first met him, he was an even bigger loser than you.",120,13917
13917,3,18,Randy ,What a loser.,121,13918
13918,3,18,Barney ,"But tonight, I'm going to make you the greatest wingman in the history of wingmen.",122,13919
13919,3,18,Randy ,"Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro. Yeah. I've been reading your blog for years. You are like a God to me. That's why tonight is going to be legendary... wait for it... dary.",123,13920
13920,3,18,Barney ,"Oh, okay, Randy, let's do this. (Barney wants to pick up two young woman)",124,13921
13921,3,18,Randy ,Ok.,125,13922
13922,3,18,Barney ,You ready?,126,13923

13946,3,18,Ted ,Told them what?,150,13947
13947,3,18,Stella ,You told them that I haven't had s*x in five years. (She seems embarrassing),151,13948
13948,3,18,Marshall ,You haven't had s*x in five years??!! That is a shocking revelation that we're just finding out right now!,152,13949

13956,3,18,Ted ,You can trust me.,160,13957

Hey, Muffin. Whoa, I think he remembers me from the last time he was here. Take Muffin to Exam Room 3. I'll meet you there. I went in, expecting the worst.

14226,4,1,Barney ,"Are you kidding? That was a great joke. It's smart, funny, beautiful, the whole package. It's everything you're afraid to let yourself want. In a joke. ""Bogeyman with a teleprompter."" Classic.",25,14227
14227,4,1,Lily ,"Okay, what is so urgent that you called me and begged me to come over at 7:22 in the morning?",26,14228
14228,4,1,Barney ,"I could tell you knew something was up with me, and you're right. But I can't tell you what it is. I should tell you, but I can't! I have to. I never will! I'm going to. Let's just drop it. What's up with you?",27,14229

14251,4,1,Ted ,Really?,50,14252
14252,4,1,Marshall ,It's just that everything with you has moved so fast. You've only known each other a few months. Don't you think maybe you should slow things down a little bit? Get to know each other better?,51,14253

14255,4,1,Barney ,"I'm sorry, I don't follow you. That's like saying, ""How can an ant carry ""20 times its body weight, but root beer floats are still delicious?"" Are the two even related? Really?",54,14256

14311,4,1,Lily ,Just ask her out.,110,14312
14312,4,1,Barney ,"Robin, I was wondering if... Nothing. Gotta go. Bye. That was just a practical joke. I'm not really in love with Robin. You should've seen the look on your face.

14319,4,1,Ted ,You've got to calm down.,118,14320
14320,4,1,Marshall ,"I told you. You didn't know this girl well enough. What if... you show it to her, she doesn't like it?",119,14321
14321,4,1,Ted ,"Dude, it's just a movie.",120,14322
14322,4,1,Marshall ,"Star Wars is your all-time favorite movie, and whether or not Stella likes it is actually important. It's like, it's a test of how compatible you guys are.",121,14323
14323,4,1,Ted ,It's just a movie. It's just a movie!,122,14324
14324,4,1,Ted ,"If Stella doesn't like this movie, I can't marry her.",123,14325
14325,4,1,Marshall ,You can't.,124,14326
14326,4,1,Ted ,You want to watch it again?,125,14327
14327,4,1,Marshall ,I do.,126,14328
14328,4,1,Barney ,Where are the boys? I thought this was a group thing.,127,14329

14330,4,1,Barney ,Why?,129,14331
14331,4,1,Lily ,"Because... they're not in love with Robin, and neither am I. I mean, she's great and sweet. I'm not going to pretend that I haven't noticed her body, but this is off topic. Good luck.",130,14332
14332,4,1,Barney ,"Wait, wait, I can't do this. She'll never take me seriously. She thinks I'm some womanizing idiot.",131,14333
14333,4,1,Lily ,We both know you're more than that. Show Robin the Barney I met the other day.,132,14334
14334,4,1,Barney ,"You mean the insecure, touchy-feely she-male who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?",133,14335
14335,4,1,Lily ,Ted hit that for over a year.,134,14336
14336,4,1,Barney ,Wish me luck.,135,14337
14337,4,1,Ted ,"I just thought it'd be fun to watch a movie tonight, and since you've never seen Star Wars, I figured why not? No big deal. It's pretty good.",136,14338
14338,4,1,Stella ,Sounds like a plan. I'm gonna grab a beer. You want one?,137,14339
14339,4,1,Ted ,"The movie's already started, so...",138,14340
14340,4,1,Stella ,It's some words flying through space. I'm not going to read that anyway.,139,14341

14342,4,1,Marshall ,Off to a bad start.,141,14343
14343,4,1,Ted ,What are you doing down there?,142,14344

14345,4,1,Ted ,"What are you doing, hiding behind the couch? You need to get a job.",144,14346
14346,4,1,Marshall ,"I really do, don't I?",145,14347

14350,4,1,Robin ,Why are you acting like this?,149,14351
14351,4,1,Barney ,Like what?,150,14352
14352,4,1,Robin ,"You're being super nice. It's... freaking me out. Be... gross, be inappropriate. Be Barney.",151,14353
14353,4,1,Barney ,"I'm being Barney, and I think tonight's going to be de... wait for it... lightful. Delightful.",152,14354
14354,4,1,Robin ,Right. So I went to the chiropractor yesterday. That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour.,153,14355
14355,4,1,Barney ,Is insurance going to cover that? Sometimes they don't.,154,14356
14356,4,1,Robin ,"That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man.",155,14357
14357,4,1,Barney ,Your teeth look fantastic.,156,14358

14360,4,1,Ted ,Nothing.,159,14361
14361,4,1,Stella ,You were staring at me.,160,14362
14362,4,1,Ted ,You look really beautiful tonight.,161,14363
14363,4,1,Stella ,"You don't look so bad yourself, mister. She kisses him on the neck",162,14364
14364,4,1,Ted ,"Great scene, great scene. Star Wars fun fact number seven... George Lucas based the film's structure on Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. He also owes a debt to Campbell's work with comparative mythology.",163,14365
14365,4,1,Stella ,"Yeah, Ted, I'm losing wood over here. What's going on?",164,14366
14366,4,1,Ted ,Nothing.,165,14367
14367,4,1,Stella ,"Wait, it's really important to you that I like this movie, isn't it? I'm not gonna like it with you staring at me the whole time. Go to your room and I will come get you when it's over. Go.",166,14368
14368,4,1,Marshall ,"Should I leave, too?",167,14369
14369,4,1,Ted ,"What part, what part?",168,14370
14370,4,1,Barney ,Thanks.,169,14371
14371,4,1,Robin ,Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?,170,14372
14372,4,1,Barney ,"I don't always want to be that guy. Sometimes I want to be someone you can have an actual conversation with. Now, tell me something about you that I don't know yet. Seriously.",171,14373
14373,4,1,Robin ,"There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply.",172,14374
14374,4,1,Barney ,Why not?,173,14375
14375,4,1,Robin ,Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel.,174,14376
14376,4,1,Barney ,We both know you're more than that. Promise me you'll apply.,175,14377
14377,4,1,Robin ,It's not as easy...,176,14378

14382,4,1,Marshall ,"Great scene! Okay, we should have just heard... but Stella didn't make a peep.",181,14383
14383,4,1,Ted ,I'm gonna take a look. She's not even watching. She's texting.,182,14384
14384,4,1,Marshall ,I'll tell her you still want to be friends.,183,14385
14385,4,1,Ted ,"I don't believe this. I believe, she knows this is important to me. She's blatantly...(Ted looks at his phone) ""Stop watching me, jackasses.""",184,14386

14392,4,1,Stella ,I loved it.,191,14393
14393,4,1,Ted ,Yes! I am marrying a woman who is not only hot but loves Star Wars. That's the dream.,192,14394
14394,4,1,Stella ,What was that?,193,14395
14395,4,1,Ted ,"I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me through the space-time continuum. We did it. We did it, you m*st*rb*t*ng little b*st*rd. Champagne for everybody. Ted leaves the room.",194,14396
14396,4,1,Stella ,It was so good.,195,14397
14397,4,1,Marshall ,"You hated it, didn't you?",196,14398
14398,4,1,Stella ,"It's so stupid. First of all, how do they understand that walking bear they hang around with all the time?",197,14399
14399,4,1,Marshall ,Wookiee.,198,14400
14400,4,1,Stella ,"He goes nin nin nin... They're all like, ""That's a good point, Bear, ""let's try that.""",199,14401
14401,4,1,Marshall ,"He's a Wookiee, and his kind is actually more intelligent than they appear. That is Ted's favorite movie of all time. He watches it when he's home sick with the flu. He watches it on rainy Sunday afternoons in the fall. He watches it on Christmas Eve. Ted watches Star Wars in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad. Do you really think that you can pretend to like a movie that you actually hate for the rest of your life?",200,14402
14402,4,1,Stella ,I do.,201,14403
14403,4,1,Marshall ,"Then, Ted's a lucky guy. Bear.",202,14404
14404,4,1,Barney ,"So, here's the deal.",203,14405
14405,4,1,Robin ,"April, have... you met Barney? April just finished her shift, she's looking to blow off some steam.",204,14406
14406,4,1,Barney ,Would you excuse us for one sec? What are you doing?,205,14407
14407,4,1,Robin ,"You were so nice to me tonight, I wanted to return the favor, wingwoman-style. So, as I was saying, Barney is the Yankees' new second-baseman. And Barney, April asked if tomorrow, you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match. You can't make this stuff up. So, you two kids have fun.",206,14408
14408,4,1,April ,So are you... nervous about the game?,207,14409
14409,4,1,Barney ,"Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not. I'm just some guy who's in love with the girl that just left, and she's never going to feel the same way. So I'm just going to go.",208,14410
14410,4,1,Barney ,And that was it.,209,14411
14411,4,1,Lily ,"I'm so sorry, Barney. You can't give up. You know, it may take some time, but once Robin sees the new you...",210,14412

The streets got a little cleaner, the rents got a little higher, and one by one, the crappy old places we loved began to disappear. The Elbow Room, an old punk rock club, became a drugstore.

And then... a pickle the most... playful... little pickle, and then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce, and a... a patty... of ground beef, so... exquisite...swirling in your mouth, breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savories so... delightful.

15290,4,5,Ted ,What does that mean?,188,15291

15314,4,5,Stella ,I dreamed that Tony is spontaneous like that.,212,15315
15315,4,5,,"Ted (2030): Seriously, kids, do not invite your ex to your wedding.",213,15316
15316,4,6,,"Ted (2030): Children, on your wedding day should be the happiest of your life, the culmination of a perfect love story. My marriage, at least the first has not gone so well.",1,15317
15317,4,6,Ted ,"It's funny when I think about it. I was sure that Stella was good. When she left me, I was so devastated. But you helped me overcome that. Now the hard part is over. I came out a little louder. You know, I do not think further of it. This is the work of time, I guess.",2,15318

15322,4,6,Barney ,"Assumption. He is not pretending to be happy. Ted is really happy. He did not want to marry from the start. Ted had the best train dodge since Stand by Me Well, not the first kid, but others.",7,15323

15461,4,6,Barney ,The blue line?,146,15462
15462,4,6,Robin ,"You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that ""crease"" speaks for itself.

15463,4,6,Lily ,You do not think you'd feel better if you talked to him?,148,15464
15464,4,6,Robin ,"That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what?

You kidding me? Have you learned anything these past 8 years? You'll be sorry. You know it? You'll be sorry, and you can do anything about it because it is too late.

Mine was always there, waiting for me.",205,15521
15521,4,7,Barney ,"I'm not impressed by the talent here tonight. And more I drink, the less it is attractive. I'm a whiskey and Coke in the Cantina scene in Star Wars.",1,15522

19635,5,2,Marshall ,"Thanks, man.",25,19636
19636,5,2,Barney ,You're a terrible couple. Lily has taken all the man out of you. I used to think that's just every relationship. But what I've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the same time.,26,19637
19637,5,2,Marshall ,"Okay, right. So, if Robin knew that you were here, she would be completely fine with it?",27,19638
19638,5,2,Barney ,"Are you kidding? She'd sprint down here with a purse full of singles and a poncho for the 10:30 Jell-O show. BT-Dub, I called ahead it's lime.",28,19639

19647,5,2,Marshall ,I do! It's just not that easy.,37,19648
19648,5,2,Barney ,False! I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck's mudflaps. Took me less than a mile.,38,19649
19649,5,2,Marshall ,"Not everyone is you, okay, Barney? Even when I do start to have a dirty thought like that... it seems so much like cheating on Lily, that I feel guilty. So first, I need to have a different fantasy.",39,19650

19656,5,2,Priest ,"And so,Marshall, to honour Lily, you must find that busty delivery girl from that one time and plow her like a cornfield.",46,19657

19684,5,2,Ted ,"Wait, you... You dressur cats up in weird costumes.",74,19685
19685,5,2,Jen ,"They're not weird. See, you're being snobby again.",75,19686

19698,5,2,Jen ,Huh. I had no idea.,88,19699
19699,5,2,Ted ,"This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. 'Cause let's be honest, we are scaring people off, Jen.",89,19700

19730,5,2,Ted ,I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that.,120,19731

19738,5,2,Robin ,I'm not cool with it.,128,19739
19739,5,2,Barney ,Because they understand that it's healthy for us to do that from time to time.,129,19740
19740,5,2,Robin ,It's disgusting.,130,19741
19741,5,2,Barney ,Because it's harmless.,131,19742
19742,5,2,Robin ,Did one of your whores tell you that?,132,19743

19748,5,2,Marshall ,"Lily, Sometimes I think about other women. Okay, it happens. But even when I do, I feel so guilty that I have to imagine you... passing away first, because even in a fantasy world, I could never cheat on you. You're... you're just my life, baby. And I love you.",138,19749

19796,5,2,Marhsall ,"I wish that I could, but I've been doing this for so long, I'm all confused about death and s*x. It's gotten to the pot where every time I drive past a cemetery, I'm sportin' a partial.",186,19797
19797,5,2,Lily ,"All right, we got to fix this.",187,19798

20019,5,3,Robin ,That's right now.,184,20020
20020,5,3,Ted ,"Now, as you can see, well over 50% of the blankets have been dragged onto her side. Make no mistake. Robin Scherbatsky is a classic, textbook... cover hog. Any questions?",185,20021
20021,5,3,Robin ,"Yeah, I have one.",186,20022
20022,5,3,Ted ,"Yes, Robin?",187,20023

20024,5,3,Barney ,"I got this. So, emperor penguins-- crazy, huh?",189,20025
20025,5,3,Robin ,What the hell do you two think you're doing?,190,20026
20026,5,3,Barney ,"Marshall, did you sells out?",191,20027
20027,5,3,Marshall ,"I was vulnerable, I said good-bye to a very dear friend today.",192,20028
20028,5,3,Robin ,"Dude, it's a barrel!",193,20029
20029,5,3,Ted ,Aw! You're giving Mabel away?,194,20030
20030,5,3,Robin ,I have so many questions. Why would you do this? What were you thinking? Who the hell is that guy? (showing a guy in the classroom).,195,20031
20031,5,3,Ted ,"Oh, that's Shin-Ya. He's sort of been auditing the class.",196,20032
20032,5,3,Robin ,"""Auditing""?",197,20033
20033,5,3,Ted ,"Well, tried to explain to him it wasn't a real class, but I don't think he speaks much English.",198,20034
20034,5,3,Barney ,"On the bright side, he came in handy standing in for you during the role-playing exercises.",199,20035
20035,5,3,Robin ,Wait. You did role-playing exercises where I was played by Shin-Ya?,200,20036
20036,5,3,Shin-Ya," (speaking Chinese) They made me wear a wig, It was very demeaning.",201,20037
20037,5,3,Robin ,"You know, I can't believe you, Ted. You actually think you're some kind of an expert on me?",202,20038
20038,5,3,Barney ,Hey! He is an expert. He's a great teacher!,203,20039
20039,5,3,Lily ,(sneezing): Kiss ass.,204,20040
20040,5,3,Robin ,"You know, half the stuff in this notebook is patently wrong.",205,20041

20044,5,3,Robin , (embarassed) Oh. Yeah...,209,20045
20045,5,3,Ted ,Don't wanna leave out the righty.,210,20046
20046,5,3,Robin ,"Oh, uh, no. Um, the right one's ticklish, I guess. But the left one, yeah, I'm glad you're back there. Because that is just some sweet, sweet lovin'.",211,20047
20047,5,3,Ted ,Noted.,212,20048
20048,5,3,Ted ,That was a lie?,213,20049
20049,5,3,Robin ,We had just started dating. I was being nice.,214,20050
20050,5,3,Robin ,"(to Barney) And you. You know, I got it into my head this week that you were cheating on me. I even broke open your briefcase to look for evidence.",215,20051
20051,5,3,Barney ,That is a huge violation of my privacy! Go on.,216,20052
20052,5,3,Robin ,"You know, in a way, I was right. You cheated. You can't get some crib sheet on dating me. That's not how it works. If we didn't figure out how to be with each other in a real, honest way, I don't see the point of even trying.",217,20053
20053,5,3,Robin ,What do you want?,218,20054
20054,5,3,Ted ,Look. All that stuff I told Barney... It was personal between you and me. I'm really sorry.,219,20055
20055,5,3,Robin ,I guess I'm impressed by how much you remembered.,220,20056
20056,5,3,Ted ,"It's funny. When you date someone, it's like you're taking one long course in who that person is and then, when you break up, all that stuff becomes useless. It's the emotional equivalent of an English degree. I guess I just liked the idea of putting all my Robin Scherbatsky knowledge to good use, you know?",221,20057
20057,5,3,Robin ,"Well, since you know me pretty well... am I fooling myself with this whole Barney thing?",222,20058
20058,5,3,Ted ,"I don't know. I will say this, though. I've seen Barney work very hard to get women. I've seen him work very hard to get rid of women. I've never seen him work this hard to keep one around. I was going to give him an A. Well, B+ -- Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve.",223,20059
20059,5,3,Barney ,"Hey. Before you say anything, I am done with this stupid Robin 101, okay? Here, I'll get rid of the notebook. (he throws it on the barrel) But there's... there's something that I did want to say to you. Robin, I have been with a lot of women, blondes, brunettes, redheads, big boobs, small",224,20060
20060,5,3,Robin ,You're an idiot.,225,20061
20061,5,3,Robin ,You know...,226,20062
20062,5,3,Barney ,Hmm?,227,20063
20063,5,3,Robin ,"That notebook, um, does contain a lot of personal info, and I think it has my home address.",228,20064
20064,5,3,Barney ,And your work address.,229,20065
20065,5,3,Barney ,Whoa.,230,20066

20074,5,4,Marshall ,"You know, I've always wondered why those tweed jackets have elbow patches.",3,20075
20075,5,4,Barney ,"Because the people who wear them are constantly going, ""Aw, geez, why can't I get laid?""",4,20076
20076,5,4,Ted ,You are wrong. The ladies dig the professor look.,5,20077
20077,5,4,Robin ,"You know, there is something to that. I remember thinking my tenth grade math teacher was very sexy. I wonder if Harold's still in jail. What? Tax evasion. Among other things.",6,20078

20174,5,4,Barney ,"Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, ""where do you live?""And she said, ""one block south."". I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you",103,20175
20175,5,4,Ted ,"Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?",104,20176

20401,5,5,Barney ,"Not only are you wrong, but you are belligerently sticking to your g*ns and insulting me in the process. Robin Scherbatsky- you are an American.",118,20402
20402,5,5,Woman ,Look who's back from the wishing well.,119,20403
20403,5,5,Ted ,"It didn't work, I'm still here. Marshall, what are we doing? We should be on the road.",120,20404
20404,5,5,Marshall ,"Ok, Ted, we're not in college anymore, okay? We don't have to drive all night.",121,20405
20405,5,5,Lily ,"Besides, they have a spa. What kind of treatments do you offer?",122,20406
20406,5,5,Woman ,"All our spa treatments are designed for couples. Would you be interested in the two person, cornmeal body scrub?",123,20407
20407,5,5,,Ted (2030): And then finally it happened. Marshall and Lily globbed into one big married glob.,124,20408
20408,5,5,Marshall and Lily, We'd love cornmeal body scrub!,125,20409
20409,5,5,Ted ,Whoa. I got to dial back on the Tantrum.,126,20410
20410,5,5,Robin ,"Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all. (She throws one bottle on the floor) Maybe I'll rob a liquor store. Maybe I won't. My choice. Learn English! The Hoser Hut. I could duck in for a drink. No, no, that life's behind me. Forget it. Well, I could in for just one beer. What's the harm in that? It's a free country. (She crosses the road and enter into the bar) *O Canada Our home and native land...* Oh, God, I miss it. *True patriots love...*",127,20411
20411,5,5,Ted ,"Hey, man.",128,20412
20412,5,5,Marshall ,Shh.,129,20413
20413,5,5,Ted ,Sorry about what I said before. You want to go to the store and get some beer?,130,20414
20414,5,5,Marshall ,Lily is asleep. I suppose I could reschedule my pedicure. What the hell? But only light beer because we have a couple hike in the morning.,131,20415
20415,5,5,Marshall ,"Dude, why are we pulling to the highway? Ted, where exactly are we going to get this beer?",132,20416
20416,5,5,Ted ,Chicago.,133,20417
20417,5,5,Marshall ,"What are you doing? We can't just leave Lily. When she wakes up, she's going to freak!",134,20418
20418,5,5,Ted ,She'll have a back rub and a crumpet. She'll be fine. Relax. Have some fun.,135,20419
20419,5,5,Marshall ,I just abandoned my wife. How am I supposed to have fun?,136,20420
20420,5,5,,"Marshall and Ted, singing: *And I would walk 500 miles. And I would walk 500 more...*",137,20421
20421,5,5,Ted ,"Hey, you really think Lily's pissed?",138,20422
20422,5,5,Marshall ,"If she's pissed, she's pissed.",139,20423
20423,5,5,Ted ,Pfft.,140,20424
20424,5,5,,"Ted (2030): When Barney finally tracked down your Aunt Robin, it wasn't a pretty sight.",141,20425

20427,5,5,Barney ,You went Canadian.,144,20428
20428,5,5,Robin ,How Canadian?,145,20429
20429,5,5,Barney ,This Canadian. (He opens the curtains) Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky- you're in Toronto.,146,20430
20430,5,5,Robin ,"Oh, God. Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut... And I met this women's curling team.",147,20431
20431,5,5,Robin ,"We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams/Rich title double bill in Toronto.",148,20432
20432,5,5,Robin ,"How did you find me, anyway?",149,20433
20433,5,5,Barney ,"You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic...",150,20434
20434,5,5,Robin ,Canada isn't across the Atlantic.,151,20435
20435,5,5,Barney ,"You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours.",152,20436
20436,5,5,Robin ,"Barney, I'm not taking the test.",153,20437
20437,5,5,Barney ,"God, you're still drunk.",154,20438

20439,5,5,Barney ,"Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee, in you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test. But, before any of that, we're gonna do it on this bed 'cause... hotel room. Okay, let's get some coffee.",156,20440
20440,5,5,Ted ,Kind of cross.,157,20441
20441,5,5,Marshall ,You're making me wonder if this pizza is worth the 22 hour drive.,158,20442
20442,5,5,Ted ,Just like old times!,159,20443
20443,5,5,Marshall ,I feel so young again except for the chest pains.,160,20444
20444,5,5,Ted ,But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust?,161,20445
20445,5,5,Man ,It's no big secret. It's made of cornmeal.,162,20446
20446,5,5,Marshall ,Cornmeal...,163,20447
20447,5,5,Lily ,We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!,164,20448
20448,5,5,Ted ,I can't believe you guys are closing.,165,20449
20449,5,5,Man ,I can't believe we're still open. Gotcha! These are getting bigger.,166,20450
20450,5,5,Barney ,It's like an entire country without a tailor.,167,20451
20451,5,5,Robin ,"Yeah, give me two coffees.",168,20452

20457,5,5,Robin ,I'm not American.,174,20458
20458,5,5,Women ,"American money? Didn't watch the Leafs game? No ""please"" or ""thank you"" for the coffee? You sure don't seem like a Canadian.",175,20459
20459,5,5,Barney ,What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.,176,20460
20460,5,5,Robin ,"Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either.",177,20461
20461,5,5,Barney ,And there's kids playing hockey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you.,178,20462
20462,5,5,Marshall ,I don't want this anymore.,179,20463
20463,5,5,Ted ,"Dude, don't look at it. That's a rookie mistake.",180,20464
20464,5,5,Marshall ,We shouldn't have left Lily.,181,20465
20465,5,5,Ted ,"Well, if you're so worried, why don't you give her a call?",182,20466
20466,5,5,Marshall ,"I have. I left her, like, 20 messages. I said, ""I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's all Ted's fault!""",183,20467
20467,5,5,Ted ,"What exactly is ""Ted's fault""?",184,20468
20468,5,5,Marshall ,"This! This whole thing! We were having a perfectly nice trip, and then you kidnapped me. You didn't even let me, put on underwear!",185,20469
20469,5,5,Ted ,"We never used to put on underwear! That was the fun of a bro's trip to Gazzola's! We left everything, and everyone behind. It was just you and me! But now it's like you've disappeared into Lily.",186,20470
20470,5,5,Marshall ,That is not true.,187,20471
20471,5,5,Ted ,"It is true. You're not upset because you're worried she's mad. You're upset because you'd rather be with her, eating muffins than here with me, eating this delicious... I think one of my mushrooms just crawled away.",188,20472
20472,5,5,Marshall ,"Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's living. Car keys, please.",189,20473
20473,5,5,Barney ,"Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back.",190,20474
20474,5,5,Robin ,"When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country.",191,20475
20475,5,5,Barney ,"Okay, that's it. (He climbs on a chair) Attention, Canada! I am Barney from America. And I'm here to fix your backward-ass country. Number one: get real money. Don't know what board game this came from, but it's a ""jhoke"". Number two- and this is the biggie- Quit letting awesome chicks like Robin Scherbatsky get away because, guess what? You don't want her? I'm planting my flag in her- if you know what I mean, which you probably don't- and getting her the hell out of here. You may now return to being pointless. (He sits down and three men arrive behind him) Ah, this coffee is excellent. Oh. Hey, fellas. It's called a ""tie"".",192,20476
20476,5,5,Kenny ,"Sparky was my best friend, but after I married Helen, old Spark started to feel a little left out. For so long, it had been just me and him, but now he suddenly felt like Helen had taken his place. What Sparky didn't realize was, even though I loved Helen, I still loved him, too. I had room in my heart for both of them. But maybe I should have put aside some special ball-tossing time just for the two of us t o make sure Sparky knew that he was a good boy. I wish now I had, 'cause old Sparky ran out in front of a Cadillac and got splattered like a watermelon in one of them Gallagher shows.",193,20477
20477,5,5,Marshall ,"I'm sorry, ted!",194,20478
20478,5,5,Ted ,"I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. I never should have been mad at you!",195,20479
20479,5,5,Marshall ,"No, I never should have brought lily. She pees all the time, even at the apartment. Still bros?",196,20480
20480,5,5,Ted ,"Best bros. Hey, you want to crank some Van Halen just like old times?",197,20481
20481,5,5,Marshall ,"Hells, yeah!",198,20482
20482,5,5,Ted ,Or listen to the Sparky book again?,199,20483
20483,5,5,Marshall ,Listen to the Sparky book again.,200,20484
20484,5,5,Ted ,Okay. Let's listen to it again.,201,20485
20485,5,5,Barney ,"Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday.",202,20486
20486,5,5,Robin ,"Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, ""Yeah, America's cool.""",203,20487
20487,5,5,Barney ,Hmm.,204,20488
20488,5,5,Robin ,"And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, ""Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too."" I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian.",205,20489
20489,5,5,Barney ,"Wait, you can do that?",206,20490
20490,5,5,Robin ,"Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two.",207,20491
20491,5,5,Barney ,I see.,208,20492
20492,5,5,Robin ,You understand?,209,20493
20493,5,5,Barney ,"No, I can see out of my left eye again.",210,20494

20495,5,5,Lily ,Hmm? Yeah?,212,20496
20496,5,5,Marshall ,I'm so sorry that we left you.,213,20497
20497,5,5,Lily ,"Did you go somewhere, sweetie?",214,20498
20498,5,5,,"Ted (2030): Yes, kids, it turns out Crumpet Manor had pampered Lily into a nearly comatose state of relaxation. She didn't even notice we were gone.",215,20499
20499,5,5,Lily ,"Mmm... Oh, oh, oh... Yeah...",216,20500
20500,5,5,Lily ,"So, I had a great time, too.",217,20501
20501,5,5,Marshall ,That's good. And I'm so sorry you didn't get any pizza.,218,20502
20502,5,5,Lily ,"Oh, that's okay.",219,20503
20503,5,5,,"Ted (2030): And if she didn't mean it then, she certainly meant it 19 minutes later.",220,20504
20504,5,5,Marshall ,"God, my stomach! Damn you, Gazzola's!",221,20505
20505,5,5,Ted ,It's like a hot ball of lead!,222,20506
20506,5,5,Marshall ,"Baby, cut it out of me.",223,20507
20507,5,5,Marshall ,"That was a wild trip, huh, Ted?",224,20508
20508,5,5,Ted ,I know. It was kind of crazy. But how great is it to drink some Tantrum again?,225,20509
20509,5,5,Marshall ,"You know who had fun, was Lily. Lily drank like, four cans of the stuff. Right Lil'? Where's Lily?",226,20510
20510,5,5,,"Lily, on the roof of the car: Tantrum! I have to pee.",227,20511

20512,5,6,Robin ,This is nonsense. They are still playing the bagpipes.,2,20513
20513,5,6,Ted ,I know. It's been 6 hours. That must be the fact that Stan Tantric bagpipes.,3,20514
20514,5,6,Robin ,"It does not stop him from screaming to play louder, but it seems that there is rather strong. I have a glass of water in my room that vibrates like Jurassic Park.",4,20515

20516,5,6,,Ted (2030): I decided to go to the bar to be quiet. It was not really that.,6,20517

20523,5,6,Barney ,"She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum.",13,20524
20524,5,6,Ted ,There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.,14,20525
20525,5,6,Barney ,They have a big problem.,15,20526
20526,5,6,Ted ,"I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... ""little known"" because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Robin, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever.",16,20527

20531,5,6,Barney ,Big Tiger. You holding up? Want a hug? You mean yesterday? You're safe here.,21,20532
20532,5,6,Ted ,"According to Barney, Lily asking you to do your own dishes right away is a sign that your marriage falls apart.",22,20533
20533,5,6,Marshall ,"Why? Lily loves a clean sink so I do the dishes right away, what's the problem?",23,20534
20534,5,6,Barney ,I'll tell you what's the problem. You know how I was always the best single? Now I'm the best in relationship. Even better than you and Lily.,24,20535
20535,5,6,Marshall ,"Look at you. You got a girlfriend for 5 minutes and you think playing in the big leagues. Adorable. Son... I'm in a relationship for your ponytail and that you were playing the guitar with Dave Matthews Mom. I am a good boyfriend when I sleep. I can do a killer foot massage, hand and prepare a great chamomile on the other, which would make you cry. Damn, I know more about how to make popcorn and watch movies with Sandra Bullock in that you'll ever know, but thank you to worry, blue.",25,20536
20536,5,6,Barney ,Let me ask you a question.,26,20537

20538,5,6,Barney ,"Do you mind you, if the sink is full of dirty dishes?",28,20539
20539,5,6,Marshall ,Not really.,29,20540
20540,5,6,Barney ,"So what is the problem of Lily, not yours.",30,20541
20541,5,6,Marshall ,"But if I said that, we will play, so...",31,20542
20542,5,6,Barney ,"You argue. Robin, we do not fight.",32,20543
20543,5,6,Ted ,Of course I do.,33,20544
20544,5,6,Barney ,"No. And here's the secret, every time we say we're going to argue...",34,20545
20545,5,6,Robin ,"Why is there a bag of pants marked ""April 2008"" in your closet?",35,20546
20546,5,6,Ted ,So when you think you will play and you get up you go?,36,20547
20547,5,6,Barney ,It works in 100% of cases. No fighting if you're not there.This is what Gandhi said.,37,20548
20548,5,6,Ted ,This is not true.,38,20549
20549,5,6,Marshall ,I can not believe Robin supports it.,39,20550
20550,5,6,Barney ,Do not worry. It also has a good way to avoid arguments.,40,20551
20551,5,6,Robin ,The ties go to the machine?,41,20552
20552,5,6,Marshall ,You're leaving. Robin begins to coat. I never heard anything so stupid.,42,20553

20554,5,6,Marshall ,Call me crazy.,44,20555
20555,5,6,Ted ,Mad.,45,20556
20556,5,6,Marshall ,"But when you have a problem with Lily, it is discussed.",46,20557
20557,5,6,Barney ,"There's so much to do with the mouth. Why spoil it by talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say on the dishes if I was married to Lily.",47,20558
20558,5,6,Lily ,"Barney, you came home!",48,20559
20559,5,6,Marshall ,Go to the basics!,49,20560
20560,5,6,Barney ,Okay.,50,20561
20561,5,6,Barney ,"Thank you, doll.",51,20562
20562,5,6,Lily ,"Honey, you're going to wash it?",52,20563
20563,5,6,Barney ,"I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, ""Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel"" is what you will paint the?",53,20564
20564,5,6,Lily ,No. Of course not.,54,20565
20565,5,6,Barney ,"Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing.",55,20566
20566,5,6,Lily ,Thank you explained that. I get confused easily.,56,20567
20567,5,6,Barney ,It's because you're a woman.,57,20568
20568,5,6,Lily ,I do not even know why we laugh!,58,20569
20569,5,6,Barney ,Of course not.,59,20570
20570,5,6,Ted ,Are you kidding me.,60,20571
20571,5,6,Marshall ,"Wait, Ted. Listen to the man.",61,20572
20572,5,6,Barney ,"Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy artillery.",62,20573
20573,5,6,Barney ,"Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes.",63,20574
20574,5,6,Lily ,You're right. I'll do the dishes. Just after doing this.,64,20575
20575,5,6,Barney ,"Now, turn around.",65,20576
20576,5,6,Ted ,You beat him or I do it?,66,20577
20577,5,6,Marshall ,He's right.,67,20578
20578,5,6,Ted ,"No. Marshall, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Barney Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003.",68,20579
20579,5,6,Barney ,The piercing was cool.,69,20580
20580,5,6,Marshall ,"It was cool, huh?",70,20581
20581,5,6,Ted ,Stay with me! Barney is wrong.,71,20582
20582,5,6,Marshall ,"No, not at all. I hate doing the dishes right away.",72,20583
20583,5,6,Ted ,You just said the opposite!,73,20584
20584,5,6,Marshall ,I hate it! I hate it from the depths of my soul! I hate it! I hate it I hate it!,74,20585
20585,5,6,Barney ,You're welcome.,75,20586
20586,5,6,Ted ,Okay. There you are. You're gonna tell me the truth. Barney said that you did ever played.,76,20587
20587,5,6,Robin ,I think that's true.,77,20588

With improved technology, the profession's sexiest moment was changing. I'm sure it's a hernia. You can double-check? And then the man grabbed the heavens. So girls sexy stiletto heels began and became a flight attendant. I'm right and ready to fire. Then the man said, ""Life is hard. I should start taking lots of drugs.

23004,5,17,Barney ,"I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners.",25,23005
23005,5,17,Ted ,"It looks like she has read this book, Of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail. What? It was this book that helps girls find a husband. It is that of Robin. I just laminated. Okay! Barney, when you were with this girl, she subtly used the word ""s*x""?",26,23006
23006,5,17,Woman ,"I'm in the inter-gender-ing, and I have some sex-seconds before the light turns green. And then, everyone honks, and it really s*x, but I can not run because a jogger slips and falls in the Sacraments of sex-horse.",27,23007

23011,5,17,Female ,12 microns. I like the tight fibers.,32,23012
23012,5,17,Barney ,"Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle.",33,23013
23013,5,17,Barney ,She did it too!,34,23014
23014,5,17,Ted ,"And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, ""I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week? """,35,23015
23015,5,17,Barney ,"You try this shit of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail.",36,23016
23016,5,17,Woman ,"It's not crap. Sure you're alone, look at you, poor trail, is a brilliant book. And it scares the guys who only want the ass.",37,23017
23017,5,17,Barney ,Did you just say you got a kid!,38,23018
23018,5,17,Woman ,You'd be surprised how many assholes we cross. That is why my book says to never sleep at first date.,39,23019

23022,5,17,Woman ,Or the fourth.,43,23023
23023,5,17,Barney ,Just tell me how!,44,23024
23024,5,17,Female ,17.,45,23025
23025,5,17,Barney ,"Excuse me, someone is using this stool?",46,23026
23026,5,17,Ted ,That is: no s*x before hot date 17th.,47,23027
23027,5,17,Lily ,"If you're not going to take her 17th hot date, you should give up.",48,23028
23028,5,17,Barney ,"I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted...",49,23029
23029,5,17,Ted ,From Robin is Robin.,50,23030

23032,5,17,Robin ,Saturday night?,53,23033
23033,5,17,Marshall ,It invites you to come out? Say yes! Say yes!,54,23034

23036,5,17,Don ,"Robin, you okay?",57,23037
23037,5,17,Marshall ,"I just have a cold. That's why for my voice. (She goes into the kitchen and tries to pick up the phone) But great for Saturday night. One can go to a restaurant grill, and you could bring a first side for my friends Marshall. I gotta go. Kisses.",58,23038
23038,5,17,Robin ,But what are you doing?,59,23039
23039,5,17,Marshall ,"You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you.",60,23040
23040,5,17,Barney ,I can not believe. Friends... This is it! She wrote the book! It must be named Anita. My plan was to sleep with her but it changes everything. New plan: I'll sleep with her.,61,23041
23041,5,17,Lily ,"That girl that Barney hunting, it seems a somewhat anti-Barney. I like the way the universe has decided to collect.",62,23042
23042,5,17,Robin ,"Actually, Anita Barney went to see him because I have requested.",63,23043
23043,5,17,Lily ,You told to go and see Anita Barney? How you know her?,64,23044
23044,5,17,Robin ,It was my show.,65,23045
23045,5,17,Robin ,"But, uh... if you had to summarize your book in less than 30 words...",66,23046
23046,5,17,Anita ,"I would summarize in one, Robin. And that word is ""no.""By saying no constantly and consistently, it gives a power, simultaneously transforming any fool in human wreck, subject, and whining.",67,23047
23047,5,17,Robin ,"Is not this the dream of all women? After the break, we'll talk about your new book, Of course you have not yet retirement plan, look at you, poor trail, scheduled for June We come back after the break.",68,23048
23048,5,17,Mike ,It's good. You want a coffee?,69,23049
23049,5,17,Robin ,"Absolutely, Mike, great idea.",70,23050
23050,5,17,Mike ,You?,71,23051

23055,5,17,Anita ,"That Barney needs a lesson. Give me the order, and I will destroy it.",76,23056
23056,5,17,Robin ,That's to say?,77,23057
23057,5,17,Anita ,"I will use the power of ""no"" to destroy your friend Barney.Say it.",78,23058
23058,5,17,Robin ,"Come on, it does not really work, though?",79,23059
23059,5,17,Mike ,"I knew not what you wanted when I caught you a cappuccino, espresso, latte, decaf... and a Turkish coffee.",80,23060
23060,5,17,Anita ,"Thank you, Mike. Think about it.",81,23061
23061,5,17,Robin ,"I never thought that I would think, but... I thought about it.",82,23062
23062,5,17,Barney ,"This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger. (Robin phone) I put on the StairMaster and...",83,23063

23066,5,17,Robin ,"I know it was stupid, but, see, at that time, I was still depressed over the break. I was in my phase of mourning. It means a lot of tape and long nights at the sh**ting range.",87,23067
23067,5,17,Lily ,I hope this was not the same nights.,88,23068
23068,5,17,Robin ,"Serious, Lily. I do not remember everything.",89,23069

23076,5,17,Barney ,Shit. I read this entire book and I find no fault. What will I do?,97,23077
23077,5,17,Ted ,There is another option... but you're not ready.,98,23078

23079,5,17,Ted ,"If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date.",100,23080
23080,5,17,Barney ,A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?,101,23081

23500,5,19,Lily ,Forget the weapon. It is on that now.,94,23501
23501,5,19,Ted ,The monkeys attack people? It really is a jungle out.,95,23502
23502,5,19,Lily ,This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a gang?I hope he will climb to see us.,96,23503
23503,5,19,Barney ,Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet?,97,23504
23504,5,19,Marshall ,Because I saw that the monkey did and I wanted more after.,98,23505

23516,5,19,Marshall ,Okay. That's what happened.,110,23517
23517,5,19,Barney ,"No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana...",111,23518
23518,5,19,Marshall ,"I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well.",112,23519
23519,5,19,Barney ,You're right. The banana was on the floor.,113,23520
23520,5,19,Marshall ,Was not... Was not banana banana.,114,23521

23523,5,19,Robin ,"Come on, Barney. I know that Marshall has not been mugged by a monkey.",117,23524
23524,5,19,Marshall ,"This part is right. It is not unusual, right? Thailand, China, Costa Rica, people are attacked by monkeys all the time.They are gatherers. Because of their dynamic inter-social, have a predisposition to flight, gives them a genetic advantage.",118,23525
23525,5,19,Lily ,You've been mugged by a monkey!,119,23526
23526,5,19,Ted ,It might be curious. You were wearing a yellow hat?,120,23527
23527,5,19,Ted ,What? Him in your program? And my model?,121,23528
23528,5,19,Robin ,No one wants to see a guy who comes to play with dolls.,122,23529
23529,5,19,Ted ,"First, it was not what you think. Secondly, you got a guy playing with dolls.",123,23530
23530,5,19,Robin ,"So, your dolls are favorites of Rhinebeck prices next month.",124,23531
23531,5,19,Men ,"Only if they are holding up well. Last year, I found one of her frolicking with GI Joe. This is not funny. What were you thinking? And if you were pregnant?",125,23532
23532,5,19,Ted ,And you invited back for a second interview.,126,23533
23533,5,19,Robin ,"Because the FBI wanted to be occupied while they searched his home. Come on, Marshall. I need history. It has everything.

23548,5,19,Woman ,You've just mugged?,142,23549
23549,5,19,Barney ,"Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?",143,23550

23558,5,19,Robin ,Who knows someone who has been mugged by a monkey?,152,23559
23559,5,19,Marshall ,"Nobody except the good people of Thailand, China, Costa Rica and many other countries where the crime committed by the monkeys is a common nuisance.",153,23560
23560,5,19,Robin ,"The best is that it is possible that the story goes on national TV. Guys, this story of the monkey attacker can make me famous.",154,23561
23561,5,19,Marshall ,"Me too. Guys, it will not. I can not do that.",155,23562

23565,5,19,Marshall ,Not at all.,159,23566

23584,5,19,Barney ,I still say that it happened.,178,23585
23585,5,19,Ted ,"Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.",179,23586
23586,5,19,Barney ,"Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body.",180,23587
23587,5,19,Ted ,"It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them.",181,23588

23595,5,19,Barney ,"31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie.

23609,5,19,Barney ,"Dude, what do you do?",203,23610
23610,5,19,Ted ,"I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.",204,23611
23611,5,19,Barney ,Now I want a weapon.,205,23612
23612,5,19,Marshall ,The monkey is there.,206,23613

23614,5,19,Man ,"Because of this incident, we will send Captain Bobo in a nature reserve.",208,23615
23615,5,19,Lily ,I bet he will love it.,209,23616
23616,5,19,Man ,"No, ma'am. You see, we will separate him from his wife, Milly. They have been together long.",210,23617
23617,5,19,Marshall ,The name of his companion is Milly?,211,23618
23618,5,19,,Ted (2030): And then the interview began.,212,23619
23619,5,19,Robin ,"In your own words, describe what happened.",213,23620
23620,5,19,Marshall ,"Well... I'd love to tell you what happened, Robin. But... I really want to know what's under that sheet.",214,23621
23621,5,19,Robin ,We talk about that. We speak your aggression.,215,23622
23622,5,19,Marshall ,"People are attacked every day in New York, Robin, do we often see what's under that sheet? You can shoot it?",216,23623
23623,5,19,Robin ,We come back.,217,23624
23624,5,19,Mike ,It's good.,218,23625
23625,5,19,Robin ,What are you doing?,219,23626
23626,5,19,Marshall ,I have not really been attacked by a monkey. I invented it for that Lily buys a g*n.,220,23627
23627,5,19,Lily ,You have not been attacked by a monkey?,221,23628
23628,5,19,Marshall ,"What are you talking, baby? Of course I do.",222,23629
23629,5,19,Robin ,"Great, tell it to America. Five minutes.",223,23630
23630,5,19,Marshall ,Not five minutes. I have not been attacked by a monkey.,224,23631
23631,5,19,Lily ,It's good. I buy a g*n.,225,23632
23632,5,19,Marshall ,No. I got mugged.,226,23633

23634,5,19,Marshall ,No! I have not been mugged!,228,23635
23635,5,19,Barney ,You know if it was attacked?,229,23636
23636,5,19,Ted ,I have no idea.,230,23637
23637,5,19,Man ,"Did you or not, was attacked by Captain Bobo?",231,23638
23638,5,19,Lily ,Tell us just what happened.,232,23639
23639,5,19,Robin ,"Yes, tell us the truth.",233,23640
23640,5,19,,Ted (2030): And that's when Marshall realized that there was one thing to say.,234,23641
23641,5,19,Marshall ,Okay! That is the truth. I go back... back to bed.,235,23642
23642,5,19,,"Ted (2030): And that was it. We never knew what really happened to the portfolio of Marshall. But we know that. Aunt Lily has never had a weapon, Robin's credibility remained intact, and Bobo and Milly lived together at the Central Park Zoo.",236,23643
23643,5,19,Robin ,"Shit. Okay, put a microphone.",237,23644
23644,5,19,Ted ,Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.,238,23645
23645,5,19,Barney ,It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good.,239,23646
23646,5,19,Ted ,"Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you.",240,23647
23647,5,19,Barney ,"Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way.",241,23648
23648,5,19,Ted ,I doubt it.,242,23649

23651,5,19,Male 2, It has one of my dolls!,245,23652
23652,5,19,Man ,"Bobo, just there, Bobo.",246,23653

23661,5,20,Clint ,"Ted, your mother is really a woman... really erotic boy.",3,23662
23662,5,20,Ted ,Please do not.,4,23663
23663,5,20,Clint ,"As a painter, slash, composer, slash, voluntary combatant with fear. I find it incredibly... sensual. But you have s*x own memories of your mother, right?",5,23664
23664,5,20,Ted ,"Please, stop.",6,23665
23665,5,20,Clint ,"Exciting her nipple, receiving her milk. You follow me?Fine.",7,23666
23666,5,20,Mother ,I can not believe I'm with this man.,8,23667
23667,5,20,Ted ,"Mom, mom, it's good. You're not obliged to ask you with him. There's full of guys...",9,23668
23668,5,20,Mother ,It's so cool! And he chooses!,10,23669
23669,5,20,Ted ,"Yeah! Finally, I... I'm glad you're happy.",11,23670
23670,5,20,Clint ,"Oh, well... because that was an ad to make you... Son.",12,23671
23671,5,20,,"Ted (2030): Yes, my mother was lapping. I married for the second time before I get married once. I was so happy for them.f*cking happy. While weddings can be magical. As far as I know, I'll end up dancing with my future wife in this marriage.",13,23672
23672,5,20,Woman ,"And if you do not boil the jars of jam, it will be a haven for bacteria.",14,23673
23673,5,20,,Ted (2030): It was not her.,15,23674
23674,5,20,Lily ,"Oh, congratulations!",16,23675
23675,5,20,Marshall ,We're so happy for you!,17,23676
23676,5,20,Mother ,I feel like my 19 years. It is as if the past 35 years had never happened.,18,23677

23678,5,20,Clint ,"Son, to show you that your mother and I will always be there for you, I want you to have this beautiful picture I have painted.",20,23679
23679,5,20,,"Ted (2030): Children, there was no guitar.",21,23680

23690,5,20,Barney ,You're currently whining?,32,23691
23691,5,20,Robin ,"I know it's stupid, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?",33,23692
23692,5,20,Barney ,"Not as much as me, Robin. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.",34,23693
23693,5,20,Barney ,"And then I just tell you guys what Robin has done, but you were there for. I must tell you the rest of the wedding. Aunt Meredith!",35,23694
23694,5,20,,"Ted (2030): Children, I can not exaggerate how horrible it is to be a single guy in his mother's second marriage.",36,23695

23707,5,20,Lily ,"Seriously, Ted is fine? I mean, I know that the weekend was hard, but hey... it's weird radio silence.",49,23708
23708,5,20,Robin ,I know. His mother called such five times to ask where he was.,50,23709
23709,5,20,Barney ,Sorry Robin. They are all out of pretzels. And I know how you're emotional. (He gives her a stack of paper towels) Shh. Leave it alone.,51,23710
23710,5,20,Robin ,"Okay! Okay, I... I cried during the song Clint.",52,23711
23711,5,20,Barney ,She cried to the song of Clint.,53,23712
23712,5,20,Ted ,"Hi, guys.",54,23713
23713,5,20,Lily ,"Ted, where were you?",55,23714
23714,5,20,Robin ,Is that okay?,56,23715
23715,5,20,Ted ,"Oh, that's fine. I'm in top form. Go. We'll take a look!",57,23716
23716,5,20,Marshall ,"Hey, man, you would not possibly let someone who does not like a kind of mania old driving license?",58,23717
23717,5,20,Lily ,"Yeah, but where we're going to end?",59,23718
23718,5,20,Ted ,"First, let me tell you what happened on the wedding day.",60,23719
23719,5,20,Ted ,"Watching my mother to marry, I realized how I was late in relation to it on my life. I'm just going to leave here. So I walked into my hotel room and I went on a website where I go sometimes when I have trouble sleeping.",61,23720
23720,5,20,All ,"Oh! Oh! Oh! Ted, come! Oh, my god!",62,23721
23721,5,20,Lily ,We do not want to know what you do on the internet when you feel alone.,63,23722
23722,5,20,Ted ,I have not spent... It is not that part of the night I was talking about.,64,23723
23723,5,20,Ted ,"I was on my favorite site for real estate auction... Come on, we all did... visit some properties on the site.",65,23724
23724,5,20,Ted ,Guys... I just bought the house of my dreams.,66,23725
23725,5,20,Lily ,"What, are you saying that you bought the house?",67,23726
23726,5,20,Ted ,"I mean, I put an online auction and I won the next day and I was accepted. I have just finalized all the paperwork.",68,23727
23727,5,20,Barney ,"And that was fine with Blair Witch, and she tried to haggle on closing costs?",69,23728
23728,5,20,Marshall ,"Try not to laugh with you that, man.",70,23729
23729,5,20,Ted ,"So, I thought this piece would be the desktop. You see, a place just for dad. I mean, kids can come if they read a book, but no toy. This is not about to hold my love. It is rather a question of drawing a boundary.",71,23730
23730,5,20,Robin ,Whoa.,72,23731
23731,5,20,Lily ,"Ted, you're barge. It will take years and a small fortune for it to be liveable.",73,23732
23732,5,20,Ted ,"I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move.",74,23733
23733,5,20,Barney ,"Is it in the room with us right now, Ted?",75,23734
23734,5,20,Ted ,"Okay, okay. I know. I have not found Ms. Mosby yet, but I will get it. Knock on wood.",76,23735
23735,5,20,Marshall ,"Look out, man.",77,23736
23736,5,20,Lily ,"Ted, you can not go on like this where you will make your life. It does not work like that.",78,23737
23737,5,20,Robin ,"Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done.",79,23738
23738,5,20,Barney ,The dumbest thing that ON've ever done.,80,23739
23739,5,20,Marshall ,"Okay, well. Ted let alone a little, right?",81,23740
23740,5,20,Ted ,Thank you.,82,23741
23741,5,20,Marshall ,"Okay? We all did stupid stuff in our lives. For example, I remember once when I put the rocket in the bathroom and tried to put them to dry in the microwave.",83,23742
23742,5,20,Robin ,"My God, you had to be completely stuffed.",84,23743
23743,5,20,Barney ,"No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened.",85,23744

23751,5,20,Marshall ,"Drum roll, please. I was... Drunk!",93,23752
23752,5,20,Barney ,"You know, I'm glad Robin have guessed. Because it is really sensitive and fragile. I talk about the times she cried during the song Clint. And while I whisper, I hope she hears me.",94,23753
23753,5,20,Robin ,It was not me!,95,23754
23754,5,20,Lily ,What?,96,23755
23755,5,20,Robin ,It's not me who cried during the song Clint.,97,23756
23756,5,20,Robin ,Are you crying?,98,23757
23757,5,20,Barney ,"I know it's silly, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?",99,23758
23758,5,20,Robin ,Not as much as me.,100,23759
23759,5,20,Barney ,I shall spin you 500 dollars if it happened to you instead of me.,101,23760
23760,5,20,Robin ,$ 500? No worries.,102,23761
23761,5,20,Barney ,"Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done.",103,23762
23762,5,20,Barney ,"Wait, you're...",104,23763
23763,5,20,Man going," Hi, I'm here for inspection.",105,23764
23764,5,20,Ted ,"Oh, great! I began to think that you would not come.",106,23765
23765,5,20,Man ,"Well I'm here for a while, but I think the bell does not work.",107,23766

23770,5,20,All ,Hey! Hey! Hey!,112,23771
23771,5,20,Marshall ,"Okay! Well! Well, just remember that we all did stupid stuff in our lives, okay? For example, once I tried to cycle on an extension ladder to a roof of a two-story house. The only question is I was a kid or drunk? Drum roll, please.",113,23772
23772,5,20,Marshall ,I was...,114,23773
23773,5,20,Mother ,Marshall is dead! Marshall died!,115,23774
23774,5,20,Marshall ,"A kid! Mom, are you? You always make a fuss about nothing.",116,23775
23775,5,20,Ted ,"Hey, check the porch, huh? Go. I will put a gate there.Every Sunday here, it'll be a huge party sausage.",117,23776
23776,5,20,Marshall ,Hmm... sausage party?,118,23777
23777,5,20,Ted ,"Burgers, burgers will be made.",119,23778
23778,5,20,Lily ,"Ted, stop that. You can not keep this house. This is a huge mistake.",120,23779
23779,5,20,Ted ,"Lily, listen to me. I had a plan, right? A woman, a house, children, and it turned out that the universe is really shit to what is the wife and children. So what is the thing I can control? The house I bought. It's not a huge mistake.",121,23780
23780,5,20,Marshall ,"Exactly. Now, I currently drive the car of my brother in the opposite direction on I-94. Now that was a big mistake. I was... a kid.",122,23781
23781,5,20,Robin ,"Wow, Barney. You've been crying about this guy or what?",123,23782
23782,5,20,Man ,"Yeah, you have leaky pipes. But on the bright side, the pond in your basement drowned rats the biggest and slowest.The others, well... They go by.",124,23783
23783,5,20,Lily ,"You see, you should have waited to see all the problems that home.",125,23784
23784,5,20,Ted ,"You can always have problems with any decision, but you can not let that stop you. First day in college, Marshall knew he wanted to spend his life with you. And if someone was there to contradict his decision?",126,23785
23785,5,20,Marshall ,"I know this is our second hot date but, Lily Aldrin, I will marry you.",127,23786
23786,5,20,Man ,"Not so fast. (He brings Lily in the room) was some form of problem here. These hips are not suitable for a baby Eriksen.And that thing she does not have the right filter. This is a maintenance problem that never leave. And I know you think like this gothic look now. But basically, you've always imagined with a Spanish style? I would recommend you take a look at the options in the lease.",128,23787
23787,5,20,Ted ,"But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.",129,23788
23788,5,20,Barney ,"It was Robin! ""What! ""Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know.",130,23789
23789,5,20,Robin ,"Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?",131,23790
23790,5,20,Barney ,Of course.,132,23791
23791,5,20,Robin ,"I made a mistake in letting you go, right? Your pen1s is huge.",133,23792
23792,5,20,Lily ,"Boy, you've almost had us still.",134,23793
23793,5,20,Marshall ,You're always a little too far.,135,23794
23794,5,20,Barney ,Shit.,136,23795
23795,5,20,Man ,"Well, good news. I think we all will soon be out of here.",137,23796
23796,5,20,Ted ,Really?,138,23797
23797,5,20,Man ,"Yes, I ended up downstairs and outside. Now, I could continue to look and see what I could do except black mold, bearing walls damaged, frayed electrical son, lead paint, water damage, fire damage, sun damage, off the cares, the floor is rotting... Oh, look at that, not termites. The chimney cracked, bats, rats, spiders, raccoons, the tramp, the gutter parts, the old fuse box, paint the kitchen which is not bad, but really swear the plates with the plans working. Or I could advise you not to buy this miserable house Guantanamo Bay, and suggest you break all by before a wind blowing through all son of bitches from here.",139,23798
23798,5,20,Ted ,And if I had already bought the son of a bitch?,140,23799
23799,5,20,Man ,I'll see at the top if all goes well.,141,23800
23800,5,20,Marshall ,He said he had found a tramp?,142,23801
23801,5,20,Ted ,"Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here.",143,23802
23802,5,20,Barney ,I see a complaint.,144,23803
23803,5,20,Man ,Found termites.,145,23804

24805,6,1,Ted ,"Oh, man! That guy is cool. His hair's all cool, he's got a cool belt.",136,24806
24806,6,1,Robin ,"Well, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy. Who's feeling nachos?",137,24807
24807,6,1,Barney ,"Oh, look at you, Robin. You're jealous.",138,24808
24808,6,1,Robin ,Jealous?,139,24809
24809,6,1,Barney ,"Yeah, jealous, because she's got it, and you've lost it.",140,24810
24810,6,1,Robin ,I have not lost it.,141,24811
24811,6,1,Barney ,You lost it.,142,24812
24812,6,1,Robin ,"I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want.",143,24813
24813,6,1,Barney ,"Robin, girls are like cartons of milk. Each one has a hotness expiration date, and you've hit yours. I'm not saying the occasional guy won't still open the fridge, pick you up, give a sniff, shrug and take a sip anyway But it's all downhill from here.",144,24814
24814,6,1,Robin ,I don't have to take this. But I do have to take this.,145,24815
24815,6,1,Marshall ,"Okay, so you just want me to call my dad and tell him that we're not having a baby?",146,24816
24816,6,1,Lilly ,That's about the size of it.,147,24817
24817,6,1,Marshall ,"Okay, out of curiosity,when do we tell him about the baby?",148,24818
24818,6,1,Lily ,We'll tell him about the baby when there's a baby to tell him about.,149,24819
24819,6,1,Marshall ,"So, he just gets no notice? He just walks into his boss's office, and says, ""I just had a grandson. I'm gonna be out for three months.""",150,24820
24820,6,1,Lily ,Out for three months?,151,24821
24821,6,1,Marshall ,Yeah. He and my mom are coming to live with us when the baby's born. We talked about this.,152,24822
24822,6,1,Lily ,"No, we didn't.",153,24823
24823,6,1,Marshall ,"I meant, me and my dad.",154,24824
24824,6,1,Lily ,"You know what, Marshall? Why don't you have a baby with your dad?",155,24825
24825,6,1,Marshall ,"Oh, okay, Lily.Why don't you have a baby with your butt?",156,24826
24826,6,1,Lily ,What?,157,24827
24827,6,1,Marshall ,I can't think straight! Why do you have to wear that shirt? This is not how I thought this night was going to go!,158,24828
24828,6,1,Cindy ,Ted?,159,24829
24829,6,1,Ted ,"Oh, God, this sucks! Do you think she saw me?",160,24830
24830,6,1,Cindy ,"Hi, Ted!",161,24831
24831,6,1,Barney ,"Yeah, she definitely saw you.",162,24832
24832,6,1,Cindy ,Can I see you for a minute... in private?,163,24833
24833,6,1,Ted ,"Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her.",164,24834
24834,6,1,Barney ,"Okay, will do. And dibs.",165,24835
24835,6,1,Lily ,"Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right?",166,24836
24836,6,1,Barney ,"Oh, you don't want my opinion on that.",167,24837
24837,6,1,Lily ,Why not?,168,24838
24838,6,1,Barney ,"If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him.",169,24839
24839,6,1,Lily ,That was really...,170,24840
24840,6,1,Barney ,"Whoa, a hottie with a body! Boing...!",171,24841
24841,6,1,Lily ,Brief.,172,24842
24842,6,1,Barney ,"No. Lily, look. (looking at Robin standing at the bar) You saucy little minx. You sundressed up.",173,24843
24843,6,1,The man, Hi.,174,24844
24844,6,1,Robin ,"14 seconds! 14 seconds, and already some dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off. I... still... got... it. All right, buddy, you proved my point. Now scram. Nice belt, by the way.",175,24845
24845,6,1,Barney ,"Robin, you do look super hot.",176,24846
24846,6,1,Robin ,"Oh, do I?",177,24847
24847,6,1,Barney ,"Yeah, you do.",178,24848
24848,6,1,Robin ,Thanks.,179,24849
24849,6,1,,"Ted from 2030: I braced myself for what was next: rage, fury, a possible shanking.",180,24850
24850,6,1,Cindy ,"Thank you, Ted. After things didn't work out with us, I got really sad for a while. But then I realized, you're not what I wanted, Ted, and I'm not what you wanted. I'm sorry I was such a jerk. I feel like I should make it up to you somehow. You know, buy you a beer or Yankees tickets, or...",181,24851
24851,6,1,Ted ,"Or set me up with one of your friends. No, I'm kidding. That would be weird.",182,24852
24852,6,1,Cindy ,"No, it wouldn't.",183,24853
24853,6,1,Ted ,"It wouldn't, would it? Any one of those three. Whichever's easiest and right nearby. And not the beer.",184,24854
24854,6,1,Cindy ,I should get back.,185,24855
24855,6,1,Ted ,Totally.,186,24856
24856,6,1,Cindy ,Come say good-bye before you leave.,187,24857
24857,6,1,Robin ,Say good-bye before you leave?,188,24858
24858,6,1,Ted ,Her words exactly.,189,24859
24859,6,1,Barney ,"Dude, you are so in. That is so awesome. A high five doesn't even cut it. High six!",190,24860
24860,6,1,Ted ,"She didn't see us high-six, did she?",191,24861
24861,6,1,Barney ,No. Good. That was pretty lame.,192,24862
24862,6,1,Ted ,"Yeah, let's never do that again.",193,24863
24863,6,1,Lily ,Marshall?,194,24864
24864,6,1,Marshall ,"What? Lily, what? Are there more members of my family that you want to crap all over?",195,24865
24865,6,1,Lily ,Here's the thing.,196,24866
24866,6,1,Marshall ,"I'm sorry. Hold on. Just... It's my dad. Lily, it's my dad, okay? I love him, and if he calls me, I'm gonna answer the phone! Hey, Dad.",197,24867
24867,6,1,Marvin ,"Hey, hey. I know it's late, but I just had to call. How'd it go?",198,24868
24868,6,1,Marshall ,"Dad, this is...",199,24869
24869,6,1,Marvin ,Did you do everything the books say? Did you put the pillow under her back?,200,24870
24870,6,1,Marshall ,"Dad, I'm in the middle of something right now.",201,24871
24871,6,1,Marvin ,Did it feel like a boy? You can tell.,202,24872
24872,6,1,Marshall ,"He's insane. My dad is insane. I'm so sorry, Lily. He's just... He's so... enthusiastic. It's ridiculous, you know? Like, who's like that?",203,24873
24873,6,1,Lily ,"You. You're like that. You and your dad both care so much. It's... it's why women fall in love with the Eriksen men to begin with. But right now, it's a lot of pressure.",204,24874
24874,6,1,Marshall ,"Baby, I'm not trying to pressure you one bit.",205,24875
24875,6,1,Lily ,What if I can't have a baby? That could happen. I could totally let you down. Has that thought not occurred to you?,206,24876
24876,6,1,Marshall ,"Not even for one second. Not having a baby would suck, but the idea of you letting me down... that's impossible. That would be like aliens landing. That's a bad example, because that could happen. It probably already has. I saw this, episode... All right.",207,24877
24877,6,1,Ted ,I'm doing this. I am going over there. Wish me luck.,208,24878
24878,6,1,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, nothing in this life quite compares to the sweet, terrifying exhilaration of making your move. When you just put it all on the line and go for it. And that night, by golly, Cindy went for it. So no, kids, that girl wasn't your mother. She ended up being someone else's mother. In fact, they both did.",209,24879
24879,6,1,Robin ,"Like I said, she's here on a date.",210,24880
24880,6,1,,Ted from 2030: So that was not the day I met your mother. The day I met your mother was the day of a wedding.,211,24881
24881,6,1,Ted ,"Okay, maybe I'm a little nervous.",212,24882
24882,6,1,Marshall ,"Dude, it's just a wedding toast.",213,24883
24883,6,1,Ted ,"I know. I just... I want it to be great, you know? I want this whole day to be great.",214,24884
24884,6,1,Marshall ,It will be.,215,24885
24885,6,1,Lily ,Best man? You're being summoned.,216,24886
24886,6,1,Ted ,"Geez, what now?",217,24887
24887,6,1,Marshall ,"Ted, seriously, relax. Everything's... Okay, and it's raining.",218,24888
24888,6,1,Ted ,Yeah. You were saying?,219,24889
24889,6,1,Marshall ,"You didn't happen to bring an umbrella, did you?",220,24890
24890,6,1,Ted ,No. I didn't bring an umbrella.,221,24891
24891,6,1,Marshall ,"I mean, everyone told us that it might take a while, but... We thought we might be the exception to the rule. Anyways, we're getting back on that horse. I mean, feeling good about the future. Obviously, this goes without saying, but you won't tell Lily about any of this, right?",222,24892
24892,6,1,Ted ,No! Of course! Absolutely!,223,24893
24893,6,2,Barney ,"So, this chick and I are going at it behind the Central Park Zoo. The Bonobo chimps start giving us a standing O, and just when I'm about to give her the same thing... What up?... I... I can't. I just... I can't. Guys, I know you count the minutes until you can escape from your humdrum lives by hearing how awesome mine is, and I love doing that for you, but I just can't tonight.",1,24894
24894,6,2,Robin ,What's wrong?,2,24895
24895,6,2,Barney ,I don't want to talk about it.,3,24896
24896,6,2,Robin ,"Okay. Hey, you guys see Deadliest Catch last night?",4,24897
24897,6,2,Ted ,Did I ever! Deadliest Catch ever!,5,24898
24898,6,2,Barney ,"All right, I'll tell you! My mother is selling the house I grew up in. All of my childhood memories gone, just like that!",6,24899
24899,6,2,Ted ,"That sucks. I've been there, buddy.",7,24900
24900,6,2,Marshall ,What are you talking about? Your mother still lives in the house you grew up in.,8,24901
24901,6,2,Ted ,"With her new hippie husband, Clint. The comfort of home is a little ruined when someone turns your old room into what I'm pretty sure is a Tantric s*x temple. With all the bamboo, pot smoke and '60s music, it's like my old G.I. Joes are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback.",9,24902
24902,6,2,Barney ,"Anyway, I need you guys to come out to Staten Island on Saturday and help box everything up.",10,24903
24903,6,2,Lily ,You expect us to spend a whole day packing up your mom's house?,11,24904
24904,6,2,Barney ,Of course not. It's a two-day job.,12,24905
24905,6,2,Robin ,Pass.,13,24906
24906,6,2,Ted ,Same.,14,24907
24907,6,2,Marshall ,Unsubscribe.,15,24908
24908,6,2,Barney ,"You guys are adorable. You seriously believe that I, Barney Stinson, can't talk you into this? I got the Queen to give me a fist bump.",16,24909
24909,6,2,Ted ,No one believes that story.,17,24910
24910,6,2,Lily ,"You may be able to talk the brain surgeons you pick up into doing whatever you want, but it's not gonna work on us.",18,24911
24911,6,2,Lily ,How did he do that?,19,24912
24912,6,2,,Ted from 2030: So there we were helping Barney pack up his childhood home.,20,24913
24913,6,2,Barney ,"Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box.",21,24914
24914,6,2,Ted ,"Yeah, that's what your mom said.",22,24915
24915,6,2,Barney ,How dare you!,23,24916
24916,6,2,Ted ,"No, she actually said that.",24,24917
24917,6,2,Lauretta ,"Oh, dear, I thought I told you, that's just not going to fit in there.",25,24918
24918,6,2,James ,"Someone order something tall, dark and awesome?",26,24919
24919,6,2,Everyone ,James!,27,24920
24920,6,2,Barney ,Bro!,28,24921
24921,6,2,Ted ,How you doing?,29,24922
24922,6,2,James ,Hey!,30,24923
24923,6,2,Lauretta ,"Oh, my goodness!",31,24924
24924,6,2,James ,Mama.,32,24925
24925,6,2,Lauretta ,Look at my two sons. So big and strong and handsome.,33,24926
24926,6,2,Barney ,Mom. Stop.,34,24927
24927,6,2,Lauretta ,"And how is my delicious little grandson? Oh, did he get the clothes I sent him?",35,24928
24928,6,2,James ,"Check it. Huh? How cute is that, right? When was the last time you saw a diaper poking out of a Dolce and Gabana suit?",36,24929
24929,6,2,Barney ,Tuesday at work. Some of the senior partners are really getting up there.,37,24930
24930,6,2,Robin ,"So, Ted, yesterday at work, I totally talked you up to that super-hot makeup girl, Liz.",38,24931
24931,6,2,Ted ,Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. What did you say?,39,24932
24932,6,2,Robin ,"Oh, you know, how funny you are...",40,24933
24933,6,2,Ted ,Guilty.,41,24934
24934,6,2,Robin ,Handsome.,42,24935
24935,6,2,Ted ,"Who, me?",43,24936
24936,6,2,Robin ,Incredible lover.,44,24937
24937,6,2,Ted ,Really?,45,24938
24938,6,2,Robin ,"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I was all like, ""He knows a woman's body better than she knows her own, endless waves of pleasure just cresting and breaking for hours and hours..."" Blah, blah, blah. ""Orgasms so intense that you just black out."" All that stuff.",46,24939
24939,6,2,Ted ,"Robin, how can I possibly live up to that review?",47,24940
24940,6,2,Robin ,"What? You know what you're doing down there. Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it. We know this.",48,24941
24941,6,2,Ted ,"But that is not the point. I mean, you broke the first rule of setting people up: undersell. It's like, if someone's never seen The Karate Kid, you don't say, ""It's the greatest movie ever."" You say, ""Uh, it's pretty good"" And then they see it, it blows their freakin' mind. Because Cobra Kai sensei's all like, ""Sweep the leg!"" And Daniel-san's all like... (high-pitched vocalizations, (mitates whooshing sounds)",49,24942
24942,6,2,Robin ,Maybe I did oversell you a bit.,50,24943
24943,6,2,James ,Thank you guys so much for helping us out with this stuff.,51,24944
24944,6,2,Lily ,"Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world?",52,24945
24945,6,2,Barney ,"I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",53,24946
24946,6,2,Barney ,"I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",54,24947
24947,6,2,Marshall ,That sounds plausible.,55,24948
24948,6,2,Barney ,"Hey. It's true. Tell him, James.",56,24949
24949,6,2,James ,"Oh, yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap. He would hit it from the outside, hit it from the inside... He sucked. Coach cut him from the team, and Mom fed him that story so he'd feel better.",57,24950
24950,6,2,Barney ,"Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this...",58,24951
24951,6,2,Barney ,"""Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10:00 in the morning, she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool. Love, Postmaster General.",59,24952
24952,6,2,Barney ,Thank you.,60,24953
24953,6,2,Marshall ,Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot?,61,24954
24954,6,2,James ,"Constantly. I mean, she put more effort into some lies than others.",62,24955
24955,6,2,Barney ,Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?,63,24956
24956,6,2,Loretta ,"Oh, I don't know... That guy.",64,24957
24957,6,2,Robin ,"Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too?",65,24958
24958,6,2,James ,"No. No, no. I heard Flip Wilson, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Meadowlark Lemon... The list goes on. I still can't get a straight answer about who my real dad is. And Barney's no help. He still believes every lie that my mom told us growing up. Not me. I caught on early.",66,24959
24959,6,2,Barney ,Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth...,67,24960
24960,6,2,Ted ,Damn. Loretta really lied a lot to her kids.,68,24961
24961,6,2,Lily ,"Well, she's not alone. Whenever Marshall was acting too hyper, his mom would suddenly decide he was ""sick"" and give him cough medicine until he passed out.",69,24962
24962,6,2,Marshall ,"I'm pretty sure that's what stunted my growth. I hit 6'4"" in the fifth grade, and then I just stopped.",70,24963
24963,6,2,Lily ,And then there's the most popular parental lie in history. Santa.,71,24964
24964,6,2,Marshall ,"Yeah, but that's a good lie. Like when we tell Ted he'll meet the right girl and settle down.",72,24965
24965,6,2,Ted ,I always find that reassuring.,73,24966
24966,6,2,Marshall ,"You will meet her, buddy.",74,24967
24967,6,2,Ted ,You think so?,75,24968
24968,6,2,Marshall ,Yeah!,76,24969
24969,6,2,Lily ,"Santa's still a lie, and I'm not lying to our kids.",77,24970
24970,6,2,Marshall ,"Baby, it's Santa. Don't you want our kids going to sleep on Christmas Eve with their hearts full of hope, their heads full of crazy cough syrup nightmares, knowing that downstairs Kris Kringle is stuffing their stockings full of joy and stuffing his belly full of milk and lutefisk that they left him?",78,24971
24971,6,2,Lily ,Milk and lutefisk? Santa doesn't get cookies in Minnesota?,79,24972
24972,6,2,Marshall ,"Yeah, that's just what Santa needs at 3:00 a.m. when he's battling a snowstorm over the Rockies: a sugar crash. No. Santa needs protein.",80,24973
24973,6,2,Lily ,I'm not lying to our kids.,81,24974
24974,6,2,Barney ,Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class.,82,24975
24975,6,2,James ,"Funny how all these girls have the exact same handwriting as the Postmaster General, Mom, and... home run king, Frank Aaron.",83,24976
24976,6,2,Barney ,"Yeah, school girls... The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't... Who's Sam Gibbs?",84,24977
24977,6,2,James ,No idea. Why?,85,24978
24978,6,2,Barney ,Mom addressed this and never sent it.,86,24979
24979,6,2,James ,What's in it?,87,24980
24980,6,2,Barney ,"Hey. (laughs) It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote... ""Your son.""",88,24981
24981,6,2,Loretta ,"Okay, everyone, lunch is ready. Who wants Sloppy Joes?",89,24982
24982,6,2,James ,"Mom, who's Sam Gibbs?",90,24983
24983,6,2,Loretta ,That doesn't sound familiar. Who wants Sloppy Joes?,91,24984
24984,6,2,James ,"There's a picture of me and Barney in an envelope addressed to him. And you wrote ""your son"" on the back.",92,24985
24985,6,2,Loretta ,"Oh, no, that... It says ""Yourson."" For Yourson, North Dakota. That's where we took the picture. Lovely town. We went kayaking, and you two rescued the mayor's dog, which had wandered into the rapids. That mayor, Sam Gibbs, asked for your picture so the city could make statues of you both. I guess I never sent it. That's embarrassing. Now, how about those Sloppy Joes?",93,24986
24986,6,2,James ,"If this picture was taken in North Dakota, then why is our old swing set in the background?",94,24987
24987,6,2,Loretta ,"I don't know! I did my best as a single parent, and it wasn't always easy, and I'd recommend putting the coleslaw right on top of the Sloppy Joe, because it's delicious that way!",95,24988
24988,6,2,James ,Can you believe her?,96,24989
24989,6,2,Barney ,"I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom!",97,24990

24991,6,2,Ted ,How?,99,24992
24992,6,2,Robin ,"I sent her another email. ""Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound like I was trying to oversell Ted. The truth is, he is a genuinely nice, down to earth guy, and I think you two would really hit it off.""",100,24993
24993,6,2,Ted ,Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect. That totally takes the pressure...,101,24994

24996,6,2,Robin ,"""I'll be honest. The first few times aren't going to be that great. He's going to say 'Are you finished?' more times than a waiter in a busy restaurant.""",104,24997
24997,6,2,Ted ,Stop!,105,24998
24998,6,2,James ,"Listen to me. There is no Yourson, North Dakota. Mom... And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor. He might be one of our fathers.",106,24999
24999,6,2,Barney ,"Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker.",107,25000
25000,6,2,James ,"Barney! You... You've got to stop living in these fairy tales that Mom told us! Bob Barker is not your father. Sam Gibbs might be, but Bob Barker is absolutely, unequivocally not your father.",108,25001
25001,6,2,Marshall ,"I suppose you have a problem with the Easter Bunny, too.",109,25002
25002,6,2,Lily ,Not now.,110,25003
25003,6,2,James ,"This address isn't too far. Are you coming with me, or not?",111,25004
25004,6,2,Barney ,"So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy.",112,25005
25005,6,2,James ,You're just too scared to face the truth. You're living in a dream world.,113,25006
25006,6,2,Marshall ,Maybe we shouldn't have brought these Sloppy Joes.,114,25007

25010,6,2,Ted ,I just want to hit that perfect middle ground.,118,25011
25011,6,2,Robin ,"How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out? ""Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, and really rich, but lacks bladder control."" Oh, damn.",119,25012
25012,6,2,Ted ,What?,120,25013
25013,6,2,Robin ,That last bump just made me hit send.,121,25014

25019,6,2,Barney ,"For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop. Just... just give me a second, okay?",127,25020
25020,6,2,James ,I thought you said that he... Stop.,128,25021
25021,6,2,Barney ,"Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really... you know. I'm not crazy. I just... I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up.",129,25022
25022,6,2,James ,Come here.,130,25023

25032,6,2,Barney ,"Papa! Look at us!nIt's like three of the same guy. Oh, my God, this explains why I was always so awesome at basketball. Guys, I'm black! Sorry. African-American. No. I'm allowed to say either. I got to go get my camera!",140,25033
25033,6,2,James ,"That is my younger brother, Barney. He just thought he'd meet his real dad today, and clearly, he's not taking it so well.",141,25034
25034,6,2,Sam ,"Oh, my head's kind of spinning, too. I mean, Loretta and I only saw each other for a couple of months. You were two before I even knew you existed, and at that point, your mother made it very clear she was going to raise you on her own. I felt I had to respect her wishes, but I always wanted to meet you.",142,25035
25035,6,2,Ted ,"Wait. Barney and James are two years apart. If Sam only knew Loretta for a few months, he couldn't possibly be Barney's father.",143,25036
25036,6,2,Robin ,He's also quite the detective.,144,25037
25037,6,2,Lily ,Don't worry. We'll... We'll snap Barney out of this when he gets back.,145,25038
25038,6,2,Marshall ,"Or, he could just let him have this one.",146,25039
25039,6,2,Ted ,What?,147,25040
25040,6,2,Lily ,Are you kidding?,148,25041
25041,6,2,Marshall ,"Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home, he finally admitted Bob Barker's not his dad, and then he watched James meet his real father. It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon. Can't we just let the guy be black for a day?",149,25042
25042,6,2,Barney ,"Here, Ted. Capture the moment!",150,25043
25043,6,2,Ted ,"I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl.",151,25044
25044,6,2,Barney ,"Man... I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about.",152,25045

25050,6,2,Robin ,"Hey, look at that! Liz still wants to meet you. That's great!",158,25051
25051,6,2,Ted ,I guess. Wait a minute. You said Liz was a total ten. Why would she want to meet the incontinent freak show you described? You oversold her!,159,25052
25052,6,2,Robin ,Maybe a little.,160,25053
25053,6,2,Ted ,You said she was a ten.,161,25054
25054,6,2,Robin ,I did not specify on what scale.,162,25055
25055,6,2,Ted ,You said she looked like a movie star.,163,25056
25056,6,2,Robin ,"She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear.",164,25057

25065,6,2,Barney ,"Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I... I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top?",173,25066
25066,6,2,Loretta ,"Listen... I always wanted to be enough for you boys. I think that's why it always hurt whenever you asked about your dads, because I was always trying so hard to be both parents for you. But I was being selfish. You deserve the truth. So here it is. Sam is not your father.",174,25067
25067,6,2,Barney ,Are you sure?,175,25068
25068,6,2,Loretta ,"Yes. He's black, dear. But if you want, I can tell you who your father really is.",176,25069

25074,6,2,Loretta ,"Oh, you know what, dear? Apparently, there was a mix-up with the mail. I just got this letter from the Postmaster General. ""Dear Barney, I sincerely apologize ""for losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party.""",182,25075

25120,6,3,Barney ,"Golden rule: I do not buy dinner to get the yes. Dinner's a very intimate activity. It requires a level of connection and eye contact that s*x just doesn't.

25125,6,3,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, you may remember that, a few years earlier, I was chosen to design the new Manhattan headquarters for Goliath National Bank. It was the opportunity every architect dreams about. And when the project was ultimately scrapped... it broke my heart.",45,25126
25126,6,3,Barney ,"Do you remember how awesome it was to be co-workers... Nay, bro-workers?",46,25127
25127,6,3,Ted ,Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean...,47,25128
25128,6,3,Barney ,"Ted Mosby, it's back on. We're gonna build your building.",48,25129
25129,6,3,Marshall ,"This is awesome... You're designing our new headquarters. Now, there will be voices that tell you a hockey rink on the roof is unfeasible. You've got to shut those voices out.",49,25130
25130,6,3,Ted ,"Actually, I think I'm gonna say no.",50,25131
25131,6,3,Robin ,No? Are you kidding me?,51,25132

25134,6,3,Marshall ,"Dude, none taken. Yes, GNB is, the Empire from Star Wars. But the Death Star's gonna get built either way. And don't you think the architect of the Death Star is pretty psyched to have that thing on his space resume? I mean, yes, his design was flawed in the sense that a single bullet fired into a particular vent would explode the whole thing.",54,25135
25135,6,3,Ted ,"For all we know, that was the contractor's fault.",55,25136
25136,6,3,Marshall ,"But that won't happen on your watch... you know why? Because you're Ted Mosby! And you are gonna design the most beautiful, ventless, Rebel-proof building in Manhattan, with clearly marked emergency stops for every trash compactor on the detention level.",56,25137
25137,6,3,Ted ,"Look, I know this is hard to understand, but right now, I have a quiet, simple, happy little life. And I like it that way. I know what my answer has to be.",57,25138

25148,6,3,Ted ,This morning.,68,25149

25150,6,3,Marshall ,"So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job?",70,25151
25151,6,3,Barney ,Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes.,71,25152
25152,6,3,Ted ,Am I wrong or is that exactly what Barney says when he's putting the moves on a girl?,72,25153
25153,6,3,Marshall ,"Exactly. I mean, it's almost like he's putting the moves on you.",73,25154
25154,6,3,Ted ,"Yeah, more like the opposite. He's been ignoring me all night. Barney wants me to take the job so bad he's putting the moves on me?",74,25155
25155,6,3,Marshall ,"I hope that's his end game. Actually, I don't. I like you two together.",75,25156
25156,6,3,Ted ,"I don't buy it. That's crazy, even for Barney.",76,25157
25157,6,3,Marshall ,"Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl?",77,25158

25160,6,3,Barney ,They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy.,80,25161
25161,6,3,Marshall ,The backhanded compliment to lower her self-esteem... a proven winner.,81,25162

25173,6,3,Robin ,"It's not that easy, okay? You're not just deleting a number, you're deleting a part of your life. You know, all those memories, all those experiences. It's like you're admitting they're gone forever.",93,25174
25174,6,3,Lily ,"I know, sweetie. I know. Delete it!",94,25175
25175,6,3,Robin ,"Okay, if it's that easy, I'm gonna delete one of your numbers from your phone, see how you like it.",95,25176
25176,6,3,Lily ,"My ""plezh."" If you can find a number in there that I don't call regularly, I'll gladly delete it.",96,25177
25177,6,3,Robin ,Super Kicks Karate.,97,25178
25178,6,3,Lily ,"No, not that one. That's my dojo.",98,25179
25179,6,3,Robin ,You have a dojo?,99,25180
25180,6,3,Lily ,I took an introductory karate class.,100,25181
25181,6,3,Lily ,"Ops, wrong room. Where do the grown-ups go for the real karate class?",101,25182
25182,6,3,Boy ,"What's the matter, lady? You scared?",102,25183
25183,6,3,Lily ,Of you? Please. I'm a kindergarten teacher.,103,25184
25184,6,3,Boy ,I hated kindergarten. All three times.,104,25185
25185,6,3,Lily ,But I'm totally gonna sign up for more lessons.,105,25186
25186,6,3,Robin ,How long ago did you take that class?,106,25187
25187,6,3,Lily ,"I don't know. It was around the time when everyone was going, ""Wassuuuuuuup!""",107,25188
25188,6,3,Robin ,"How do you even remember that? Lily, this is a number that you will never dial again.",108,25189
25189,6,3,Lily ,I might.,109,25190
25190,6,3,Robin ,"No, no. But you keep it in your phone because it reminds you of a version of yourself that you could be, even if it's a version of yourself that you'll never become. And that's okay.",110,25191
25191,6,3,Lily ,"No, it's not. Okay, you know what? There, gone. Your move, Scherbatsky.",111,25192
25192,6,3,Ted ,I finally know what your kind goes through. I get it now.,112,25193
25193,6,3,Robin ,"For the last time, I don't care how big it was, it is not the same as giving birth.",113,25194
25194,6,3,Marshall ,"No! Barney's been ""putting the moves"" on Ted.",114,25195
25195,6,3,Lily ,"Oh, that sucks. Although I like you two together.",115,25196
25196,6,3,Marshall ,"No, he's been doing it to try to get Ted to design the new GNB Tower.",116,25197
25197,6,3,Robin ,Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?,117,25198
25198,6,3,Barney ,"Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks! (...) Man, the courtside Knicks seats that are available to all upper level GNB employees are too close to the action. I keep getting sweat on my suit. It sucks! (...) Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks!",118,25199
25199,6,3,Ted ,He did.,119,25200
25200,6,3,Robin ,And the intense eye contact thing?,120,25201
25201,6,3,Barney ,"So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers?",121,25202
25202,6,3,Ted ,Okay. Yep.,122,25203
25203,6,3,Robin ,And the thing where he establishs intimacy through physical contact?,123,25204
25204,6,3,Ted ,You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese.,124,25205
25205,6,3,Barney ,That is so true.,125,25206
25206,6,3,Ted ,Yeah... Cream cheese has a mild flav-flavor so it... it balances out the spiciness of the jal... the spiciness of the... Dude!,126,25207
25207,6,3,Robin ,"So at any point in this did you say, ""Barney, I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. I am not taking that job""?",127,25208
25208,6,3,Ted ,"Well, I mean, not exactly in those...",128,25209
25209,6,3,Lily ,You're loving this.,129,25210
25210,6,3,Ted ,No.,130,25211
25211,6,3,Lily ,You are. You're loving the attention.,131,25212
25212,6,3,Ted ,"It's nice to be wanted, okay? And, yes, this is a new vest. Thank you all for noticing. Oh, that's right, you didn't. Barney did!",132,25213
25213,6,3,Robin ,"Oh, Teddy, you are so going to spread your legs and design that building.",133,25214
25214,6,3,Ted ,I am not that kind of architect. So get this...,134,25215
25215,6,3,Lily ,Robin never deleted Don's number.,135,25216
25216,6,3,Robin ,"Oh, everyone thinks it's so easy. Give me your phone. Let's delete one of yours.",136,25217
25217,6,3,Marshall ,"Okay. No problem. If you can find a number that I don't need or shouldn't have in here, be my guest, but good luck. I keep my phone tight.",137,25218
25218,6,3,Robin ,Edwin.,138,25219
25219,6,3,Marshall ,"Oh, no, not that one. That's the booker for the club that my band plays at. You know, my all-lawyer funk band... you remember... The Funk, the Whole Funk and Nothing but the Funk.",139,25220
25220,6,3,Robin ,You guys played one gig four years ago. I'm deleting it.,140,25221
25221,6,3,Marshall ,"No, no, we're gonna... we're gonna play another gig again. Probably really soon. It's just we all got super busy, and... We're not going to play another gig again, are we?",141,25222
25222,6,3,Lily ,"Probably not, baby.",142,25223
25223,6,3,Robin ,"See, it's hard to hit that delete button, isn't it?",143,25224
25224,6,3,Marshall ,"Well, it's just that without that number in my phone, I'm just a corporate lawyer working 60 very un-funky hours a week.",144,25225
25225,6,3,Robin ,"Sorry, Marshall. But if I have to, you have to.",145,25226
25226,6,3,Lily ,Okay. Your turn.,146,25227
25227,6,3,Ted ,"Barney, I gotta tell you something.",147,25228
25228,6,3,Barney ,"Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you?",148,25229
25229,6,3,Ted ,Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower.,149,25230
25230,6,3,Barney ,"Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else.",150,25231
25231,6,3,Ted ,"Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, ""pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more."" It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, ""Oh, God, I never should have said no.""",151,25232
25232,6,3,Marshall ,"It's not a move, dude. I executed the paperwork for the new architect this morning. Barney wasn't lying.",152,25233
25233,6,3,Ted ,"Oh, God, I never should have said no! Come on, GNB didn't really hire a new architect. This is just one of Barney's moves.",153,25234
25234,6,3,Marshall ,"It's not a move, dude. The senior partners were getting impatient. I thought you didn't even want the job.",154,25235
25235,6,3,Ted ,I didn't! I don't! I don't. I don't!,155,25236
25236,6,3,Ted ,"Okay, I'll do it!",156,25237
25237,6,3,Barney ,"What? Ted, it's too late.",157,25238
25238,6,3,Ted ,I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.,158,25239
25239,6,3,Barney ,"Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank...",159,25240
25240,6,3,Marshall ,"Okay, it's a move.",160,25241
25241,6,3,Ted ,What?,161,25242
25242,6,3,Barney ,Dude!,162,25243
25243,6,3,Marshall ,"There is no other architect. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied. I was being Barney's wingman, and I never get to be the wingman.",163,25244
25244,6,3,Ted ,You guys lied to me?,164,25245
25245,6,3,Barney ,You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here.,165,25246
25246,6,3,Marshall ,I can do better. Take me back. You son of a bitch!,166,25247
25247,6,3,Ted ,"Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me.",167,25248
25248,6,3,Barney ,We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job.,168,25249
25249,6,3,Ted ,"No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women...",169,25250
25250,6,3,Barney ,236.,170,25251
25251,6,3,,"Ted:...before me fell for. Wow, respect.",171,25252
25252,6,3,Marshall ,"No... Ted... you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me.",172,25253
25253,6,3,Barney ,"Come on, Ted! This is your dream.",173,25254
25254,6,3,Ted ,"No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no.",174,25255
25255,6,3,Robin ,"Hey, guys.",175,25256
25256,6,3,Lily ,"Where's the poop, Robin?",176,25257
25257,6,3,Robin ,"How do you do that? You are like a bomb-sniffing dog, except with poop. You are a poop-sniffing dog.",177,25258
25258,6,3,Marshall ,I think that's just called a dog.,178,25259
25259,6,3,Lily ,"Where's the poop, Robin?",179,25260
25260,6,3,Robin ,Fine. I called Don again.,180,25261
25261,6,3,Robin ,"Hey, Don! It's Robin again. Look, I am sorry for all the calls. It's just, I saw you on the news, and it made me a little crazy for a minute. I guess I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought. But I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to k*ll you. No... No, I'm not. I am happy for you. And that Asian slut on your Facebook page. She's dead, too.",181,25262
25262,6,3,Lily ,I thought you deleted his number.,182,25263
25263,6,3,Robin ,"I did, but it turns out, I memorized it. You can't delete contacts from your brain, Lily.",183,25264
25264,6,3,Lily ,"Well, you have to try. If you ever want to have closure...",184,25265
25265,6,3,Robin ,"I am never going to have closure. Okay? Closure doesn't exist. Okay, one day, Don and I are moving in together, and the next thing I know, he's on a plane to Chicago. It just... ended. And no matter how much I try to forget that it happened, it will have never not happened. Don and I will always be a loose end. We'll always be...",185,25266
25266,6,3,Ted ,"Unfinished. Gaudi, to his credit, never gave up on his dream, but that's not usually how it goes. I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy, weird church from getting built. Most of the time, it's just too difficult or too expensive, or too scary. It's only once you've stopped that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it. But it's always there. And until you finish it, it will always be...",186,25267
25267,6,3,Ted ,"Hey, Barney. Hey, Rachel. Rachel, why aren't you in class?",187,25268
25268,6,3,Rachel ,Why aren't you in class?,188,25269
25269,6,3,Barney ,"Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class? You son of a bitch. I'll call Marshall. We'll draw up the contract.",189,25270
25270,6,3,Ted ,Not so fast. I'm not that easy.,190,25271
25271,6,3,,Ted from 2030: And so I made Barney break his golden rule. I made him take me out to dinner before I finally gave him the thing he always got. Yes. And even though it didn't happen right away...,191,25272

25280,6,3,Man ,I knew this day would come.,200,25281
25281,6,4,Barney ,I cannot stop staring at that girl's face.,1,25282
25282,6,4,Ted ,Face. Huh. That's your weirdest nickname for boobs yet.,2,25283
25283,6,4,Barney ,"No, Ted, I'm really looking at her face.",3,25284
25284,6,4,Lily ,Aw... That's actually really sweet.,4,25285
25285,6,4,Barney ,"Puffy cheeks, smudged mascara, slightly red nose... That girl was just crying. She's so sad and defenseless. Anyone have a condom?",5,25286
25286,6,4,Everyone ,"Oh! Oh, God! No, no, no!",6,25287
25287,6,4,Lily ,That's it! You know what? Five-minute time-out! Corner booth! Now.,7,25288

25289,6,4,Robin ,"I don't know, it could be cool. I've never seen Woody Allen.",9,25290
25290,6,4,Marsall ,"What?! Robin, how can you be a New Yorker and never have seen Woody Allen?",10,25291
25291,6,4,Robin ,I have seen plenty of other famous people. Last week I saw... Maury Povich.,11,25292
25292,6,4,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, you know talk show host Maury Povich. It was uncanny how often we saw this guy.",12,25293
25293,6,4,Lily ,"Dude, everyone sees Maury Povich.",13,25294
25294,6,4,Marsall ,"Maury Povich is everywhere. I'm sorry, Robin, but you're not a real New Yorker until you've seen Woody Allen.",14,25295
25295,6,4,Robin ,"I am, too, a real New Yorker.",15,25296
25296,6,4,Ted ,That's adorable. You're from Canada.,16,25297
25297,6,4,Robin ,I have been here for almost six years. It's not like I just got off a boat.,17,25298
25298,6,4,Lily ,"A boat! Oh, wait, that is how you say it.",18,25299
25299,6,4,Ted ,I'd say you're not a real New Yorker until you've stolen a cab from someone who needs it more than you do.,19,25300
25300,6,4,Lily ,"No, you're not a real New Yorker till you've cried on the subway and not given a damn what anyone thinks.",20,25301

25305,6,4,Marshall ,"Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's, and Robin thinks that we should go see him.",25,25306

25552,6,5,Barney ,How can you speak of such things?,62,25553
25553,6,5,Lily ,"You're kidding. Barney, every time I mention a woman you don't know, the first thing you say is, ""Boobs?"" Not the complete sentence, ""Does she have big boobs?"" Which also would not be great. Just: ""Boobs?""",63,25554
25554,6,5,Barney ,I do not do that.,64,25555
25555,6,5,Lily ,My friend Lori from work...,65,25556
25556,6,5,Barney ,Boobs? Damn it. But... seriously. Boobs?,66,25557
25557,6,5,Lily ,"So why is it okay for guys to talk about boobs, but the moment we bring up a topic like Max's small pen1s... I'm gonna pretend this conversation never happened.",67,25558
25558,6,5,Marshall ,Impossible. Max's pen1s is stuck in my brain like a splinter. Like a splinter-sized splinter.,68,25559
25559,6,5,Barney ,"Speaking of disappointing weenies... Ted, tell them what you told me.",69,25560
25560,6,5,Ted ,I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building.,70,25561
25561,6,5,Barney ,"I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin... Wait a minute. Who's the girl?",71,25562
25562,6,5,Robin ,Duh. Of course there's a girl.,72,25563
25563,6,5,Ted ,What? I... There's no g-girl. Why would you even... Her name is Zoey.,73,25564
25564,6,5,Barney ,Boobs?,74,25565
25565,6,5,Woman ,"Beautiful building, right?",75,25566
25566,6,5,Ted ,"Look, mister, you are very convincing, and I am very flattered. Confused, even. But I'm not looking...",76,25567
25567,6,5,Woman ,I'm not a drag queen. But you definitely have me rethinking this eye shadow.,77,25568
25568,6,5,Ted ,"Not only is she funny, hot and genetically female, but get this...",78,25569
25569,6,5,Woman ,"Look at the Palladian windows, the rusticated stonework, the marble cornices...",79,25570
25570,6,5,Ted ,She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream!,80,25571
25571,6,5,Barney ,Whose dream?,81,25572
25572,6,5,Ted ,We wound up talking for hours.,82,25573
25573,6,5,Woman ,I love how old parts of the city are. Hmm. It makes me feel connected to history.,83,25574
25574,6,5,Ted ,Old is always better. I can't wait to be old.,84,25575
25575,6,5,Woman ,"Me, too. You can wear elastic everything. Your lipstick doesn't have to stay inside the lines.",85,25576
25576,6,5,Ted ,You can shoplift and pretend you're just confused.,86,25577
25577,6,5,Woman ,You could nap anywhere. Uh-huh. Even while driving. It's gonna be great. I can't wait to be all run-down and weathered and wrinkly.,87,25578
25578,6,5,Ted ,"Well, I'd say you got a pretty long wait.",88,25579
25579,6,5,Woman ,"That's sweet. It would be sweeter if you hadn't thought I was a tr*nny before, but it's still sweet.",89,25580
25580,6,5,Barney ,"Oh, Ted, that's so romantic. I want to fill a pillowcase with dead batteries and beat you with it.",90,25581
25581,6,5,Woman ,"Hey, Ted, can I ask you something",91,25582
25582,6,5,Ted ,Anything.,92,25583
25583,6,5,Woman ,"Will you sign this petition? Save The Arcadian"" We are gonna stop the bastards at Goliath National Bank from demolishing it. Will you support us?",93,25584
25584,6,5,Barney ,And you said...?,94,25585
25585,6,5,Ted ,Where do I sign?,95,25586
25586,6,5,Barney ,"Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs?",96,25587
25587,6,5,Ted ,This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,97,25588
25588,6,5,Barney ,"And what did this ""Zoey"" say when she found out that you're the one tearing down her beloved Arcadian? That you, Ted Mosby, are the Architect Of Destruction?",98,25589
25589,6,5,Marshall ,Whoa! Sweet wrestling name alert.,99,25590
25590,6,5,Ted ,"Well... Uh, it's a... it's a funny thing about that...",100,25591
25591,6,5,Zoey ,"So what do you do, Ted?",101,25592
25592,6,5,Ted ,I'm a veterinarian.,102,25593
25593,6,5,Ted ,What? I panicked!,103,25594
25594,6,5,Barney ,This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl.,104,25595
25595,6,5,Ted ,I don't do that.,105,25596
25596,6,5,Ted ,"Well, off to meet Steph. We're adrenaline junkies! [...]Penelope is taking me to the Battle of Gettysburg. We're gonna eat squirrel! [...] (Ted enters the living room, dressed up as a wizard) Look, she's really hot, okay?",106,25597
25597,6,5,Ted ,Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.,107,25598
25598,6,5,Barney ,Asian girls love them some Jews.,108,25599
25599,6,5,Ted ,And Marshall never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily.,109,25600
25600,6,5,Lily ,"Um, I think you got that backwards there, Chief.",110,25601
25601,6,5,Marshall ,And you're welcome.,111,25602
25602,6,5,Ted ,"The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?",112,25603
25603,6,5,Barney ,"No. Technically, they were eggs.",113,25604
25604,6,5,Ted ,"Did you just say ""eggs""?",114,25605
25605,6,5,Barney ,"I don't recall saying ""eggs.""",115,25606
25606,6,5,Max ,"So I walk into my boss's office and suddenly I realize, ""Holy crap, I'm about to quit""""",116,25607
25607,6,5,,"Marshall, thinking: Small pen1s. You have a small pen1s. Oh, that's super interesting, but you have a small pen1s. Damn it, Marshall! Okay. Okay. Think of any two words other than ""small"" or ""pen1s"". Got it: small pen1s. Damn it!",117,25608
25608,6,5,Robin ,"Yeah, I-I think it is so cool that you started your own law firm.",118,25609
25609,6,5,Max ,"Well, right now it's a pretty small practice.",119,25610
25610,6,5,Marshall ,"Hey, hey. I bet it's not that small.",120,25611
25611,6,5,Max ,"Bro, it's... pretty small.",121,25612
25612,6,5,Marshall ,"Yeah, but, uh, you know what they say. The important thing is-is how you use it, you know? ""The motion of the ocean."" That whole thing.",122,25613
25613,6,5,Robin ,"He said it's small, Marshall, and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on.",123,25614
25614,6,5,Marshall ,I'm just saying that I bet it's bigger than he thinks. And thick.,124,25615
25615,6,5,Max ,"Nah. Everything about it is tiny. The office is tiny. The conference room is tiny. Plus, I got a very small staff.",125,25616
25616,6,5,Robin ,Let's order!,126,25617
25617,6,5,,Ted from 2030: As I was mustering the courage to call Zoey and tell her my true identity...,127,25618
25618,6,5,Ted ,Zoey... I'm Batman. Hmm. That'd be cool.,128,25619
25619,6,5,,Ted from 2030:...the strangest thing happened.,129,25620
25620,6,5,Zoey ,I need your help. (They go outside. Zoey opens the back doors of a truck) Just to warn you. What I'm about to show you is not a hundred percent legal.,130,25621
25621,6,5,Ted ,Wasn't expecting bunnies.,131,25622
25622,6,5,Zoey ,"I stole them, Ted. My animal rights group liberated these guys from an evil cosmetics company. And I figured, ""Hey, Ted's a vet. He can check them out and make sure they're okay.""",132,25623
25623,6,5,Ted ,Absolutely. Just let me run up and get my bag of vet supplies. Okay. Why would I say that?,133,25624
25624,6,5,Max ,"Well, I know what I'm getting.Oh? Oh?The porterhouse. I've had it here before. It is like this. It's huge.",134,25625
25625,6,5,Marshall ,"Well, spare no expense, buddy. Dinner is on me, and-and get dessert. Maybe this molten chocolate lava cake? I just want you to be happy.",135,25626
25626,6,5,Max ,"Thanks, man. Next time, it is on me. Aw. Excuse me. I'll be right back. All right.",136,25627
25627,6,5,Robin ,Totally.,137,25628
25628,6,5,Marshall ,We'll just be here. (He gives a hug to Max)You're great.,138,25629
25629,6,5,Max ,"Ah. Thanks, bro. It's, uh.... it's going on a while.",139,25630
25630,6,5,Marshall ,I know.,140,25631
25631,6,5,Max ,Thanks.,141,25632
25632,6,5,Lily ,"Damn, baby, be cool!",142,25633
25633,6,5,Robin ,You're acting like he has six months to live.,143,25634
25634,6,5,Marshall ,It's your fault! You ladies and your salty sailor talk!,144,25635
25635,6,5,Robin ,"Oh, come on! What about you men and your locker room talk?",145,25636
25636,6,5,Marshall ,Locker room talk. Do you want to know what it's like in a men's locker room?,146,25637
25637,6,5,Marshall ,It's just a bunch of uncomfortable dudes trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. And one old guy just letting it all hang out.,147,25638
25638,6,5,Lily ,Are you suggesting that guys don't talk about s*x?,148,25639
25639,6,5,Marshall ,"Yes, we do, but you know what we say? ""I hit that.""""I got some.""""I tapped it."" ""I squeezed those."" Discreet and efficient.",149,25640
25640,6,5,Robin ,Not to mention classy.,150,25641
25641,6,5,Marshall ,"Thank God that I'm not dating. If I thought that Lily talked in that much detail about our s*x life, I'd probably k*ll myself. Oh, no. What did you tell her?",151,25642
25642,6,5,Lily ,"Oh, nothing. We don't talk about you!",152,25643
25643,6,5,Marshall ,Are you sure?,153,25644
25644,6,5,Robin ,Yeah. That argument has no traction whatsoever.,154,25645
25645,6,5,Ted ,You just broke in and stole these guys? Aren't you worried about getting arrested?,155,25646
25646,6,5,Zoey ,Nah. I've been arrested lots of times. Chinese Democracy.,156,25647
25647,6,5,Ted ,Wow. You're a little bit crazy.,157,25648
25648,6,5,Zoey ,"Well, I'm usually crazy for a good cause. I can't just sit by while voiceless people or animals, r even buildings et screwed over. 'm certainly not going o just sit by hile GNB turns The Arcadian nto a soulless metal box.",158,25649
25649,6,5,Ted ,"Yeah. Yeah. Although I hear there's a lovely rooftop patio where folks can enjoy a nice bag lunch, so...",159,25650
25650,6,5,Zoey ,"Ted, I will find the bastards at GNB responsible for this, and I promise you, I will take them down.",160,25651
25651,6,5,Barney ,"Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?!",161,25652
25652,6,5,Ted ,"Solid C-cup, perky bounce.",162,25653
25653,6,5,Barney ,Momentary grudging respect.,163,25654
25654,6,5,Ted ,"Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building.",164,25655
25655,6,5,Barney ,"Ted, that is never gonna happen.",165,25656
25656,6,5,Ted ,"Well, I can't tear down The Arcadian. I'm sorry, but I'm off the project.",166,25657
25657,6,5,Zoey ,"Hey, guys! I appreciate the great turnout, but just so we're all on the same page, this is not a rally to legalize marijuana.",167,25658
25658,6,5,Man ,"Oh, bummer!",168,25659
25659,6,5,Ted ,Hey.,169,25660
25660,6,5,Zoey ,"Hey, Ted. I'm so glad you came.",170,25661
25661,6,5,Ted ,"Well, you really got to me the other night. I want to get involved with ""Save The Arcadian.""",171,25662
25662,6,5,Zoey ,"Great. I'll grab you a picket sign. Hmm. Do you want ""GNB puts the douche in fiduciary..""...or ""It's always 4:20 somewhere""? Dudes, you forgot your signs!",172,25663
25663,6,5,,"Ted from 2030: As I looked up at that magnificent old structure, I realized I wasn't letting my feelings for Zoey mislead me. This building really was worth saving.",173,25664
25664,6,5,Zoey ,"Ted, everything okay? Yea... um... um... You work for GNB?",174,25665
25665,6,5,Man ,"Dude, why are you dressed like a wizard?",175,25666
25666,6,5,Ted ,"She was really hot, okay?",176,25667
25667,6,5,Ted ,How the hell could you do that?,177,25668
25668,6,5,Barney ,Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door.,178,25669
25669,6,5,Ted ,"The billboard, Barney.",179,25670
25670,6,5,Barney ,"I had to. Now that you have no shot with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal.",180,25671
25671,6,5,Ted ,You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting.,181,25672
25672,6,5,Barney ,"Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump!",182,25673
25673,6,5,Ted ,"Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?!",183,25674
25674,6,5,Barney ,Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail.,184,25675
25675,6,5,Ted ,You named the rabbit?,185,25676
25676,6,5,Barney ,"You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her. The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building. Dude, you can do whatever you want with it.",186,25677
25677,6,5,Ted ,You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want.,187,25678
25678,6,5,Barney ,So you're back in?,188,25679
25679,6,5,Ted ,Yeah.,189,25680
25680,6,5,,"Ted from 2030: That night, as I worked on a new design that just might solve all my problems... Marshall was visited by a disturbing vision.",190,25681
25681,6,5,Lily ,"Ugh, he thinks I like this...But it feels disgusting.",191,25682
25682,6,5,Robin ,"Uh, it looks disgusting.",192,25683
25683,6,5,Marshall ,"Uh, is this working for you?",193,25684
25684,6,5,Lily ,"""Uh, is this working for you?""",194,25685
25685,6,5,Robin ,"Oh, of course, because what woman doesn't like being slobbered on while some giant paws at her nether regions like Lenny from Of Mice and Men?",195,25686
25686,6,5,Lily ,"Oh, you're bad.",196,25687
25687,6,5,Robin ,More Cosmos?,197,25688
25688,6,5,Marshall ,I can't... I can't do this! I can't stop thinking about you and Robin!,198,25689
25689,6,5,Lily ,"Oh, I've had that a couple times. Just lean into it and let it fuel things.",199,25690
25690,6,5,Marshall ,"Look, no. You know what? Why don't you just... Why don't you just call Robin, okay, and have a good laugh about it? Whoa! Traction could have prevented that.",200,25691
25691,6,5,Zoey ,"Well, hope you don't mind, we made some changes to the billboard.",201,25692
25692,6,5,Ted ,"Well, that explains a few voicemails. Listen, Zoey, I think we can save The Arcadian. No. Maybe not in the way you were picturing, but I stayed up all night working on a new concept, all right? What if my design could incorporate The Arcadian's facade into the new GNB headquarters?",202,25693
25693,6,5,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, it was one of those moments in life where everything comes together... the girl, the building, everything, until...",203,25694
25694,6,5,Ted ,Are you married?,204,25695
25695,6,5,Zoey ,"Yeah. So you were saying, the facade will be completely preserved?",205,25696
25696,6,5,Ted ,This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,206,25697
25697,6,5,Ted ,"Yeah, it was about the girl.",207,25698
25698,6,5,Zoey ,"Ted, wh-wh-what are you doing?",208,25699
25699,6,5,Ted ,"This wouldn't work. Zoey, The Arcadian was a really great building once, but it's falling apart, and it's full of snakes.",209,25700
25700,6,5,Zoey ,Snakes?,210,25701
25701,6,5,Ted ,I don't recall saying snakes.,211,25702
25702,6,5,Lily ,"Then he gets this panicked look on his face, says, ""I can't do this,"" and storms out.",212,25703
25703,6,5,Robin ,"Wow, that is weird.",213,25704
25704,6,5,Lily ,But here's the crazier part.,214,25705
25705,6,5,Marshall ,No. You know what? Papa don't back down from a fight. So why don't you tell Robin... about this!,215,25706
25706,6,5,Lily ,"It was amazing. He was passionate, animalistic, a complete stud.",216,25707
25707,6,5,Robin ,"Wow. So he's right there making you say all this, huh?",217,25708
25708,6,5,Lily ,"Yup. ""'You're like a Greek god, I moaned, as the..."" I can't read that, baby.",218,25709

25710,6,5,Lily ,"""As the musky scent of man and Marshall's sure-footed traction intoxicated and overpowered me.""",220,25711
25711,6,5,Robin ,That sounds real.,221,25712
25712,6,5,,"Ted from 2030: And as for Zoey, it was funny. I'd lied to her, then completely let her down. And I barely knew the girl. But there was something about her. I couldn't help but wonder if I'd ever see her again.",222,25713
25713,6,5,Zoey ,"Hey, Mosby! You're gonna have to come out of your hole at some point, you son of a bitch! Yeah! Legalize it! Dude! Ready. Aim. Fire!",223,25714
25714,6,5,,"Ted from 2030: Why, yes. Yes, I would see her again.",224,25715
25715,6,5,Marshall ,How's it going with Robin?,225,25716
25716,6,5,Max ,"Uh, I think I have to break up with her.",226,25717
25717,6,5,Marshall ,Really? Why? You with her?,227,25718
25718,6,5,Max ,"Yeah, well, there's this... kind of weird thing she likes to do in the bedroom.",228,25719
25719,6,5,Ted ,"Hey, what's not for everyone?",229,25720
25720,6,5,Marshall ,"Guys, come on. What is it?",230,25721
25721,6,5,Max ,"Come on, bro. This is a locker room.",231,25722
25722,6,5,Marshall ,"I... What do you think it was, Murray?",232,25723

25724,6,6,Marshall ,"So, have you guys landed on a name yet?",2,25725
25725,6,6,Stuart ,"We're trying, but it's tougher than you think. You see, I like ""Tiffany.""",3,25726
25726,6,6,Claudia ,And I don't want my daughter to have a whore's name.,4,25727
25727,6,6,Stuart ,That's my mother's name.,5,25728
25728,6,6,Claudia ,I know.,6,25729
25729,6,6,Stuart ,"Oh, I got it. How 'bout we name the baby after you-- ""Frigid Shrew.""",7,25730
25730,6,6,Claudia ,"Oh, that's good. No, no, no, no. Let's call her ""Vodka."" Then at least we know you'd hold her tight and never let her go!",8,25731
25731,6,6,Stuart ,Don't knock the vodka. Wouldn't have a kid without it.,9,25732
25732,6,6,Marshall ,"Stuart, you are so... That's not gonna be us, right? I mean, how hard can it be to name a baby?",10,25733

25937,6,7,Ted ,What?,6,25938
25938,6,7,Lily ,Getting that kid's nose surgically removed from your ass.,7,25939
25939,6,7,Ted ,"It's not her nose that's in my ass, Lily, it's her heart. My class loves me; I-I'm really making an impression on those guys. I'd like to make impression on those guys.",8,25940
25940,6,7,Barney ,"Man, I love the office Halloween party. It is so much sluttier than the office Christmas party. Though not as freaky as the office President's Day Rave. Or the office Tu B'Shvat Pajama Jammy-Jam.",9,25941

25942,6,7,Marshall ,"Hey, Randy. Uh, you want a beer?",11,25943

25953,6,7,Marshall ,"Look at them heading home after their dirty, filthy hookups.",22,25954

26013,6,7,Marshall ,"Okay, that, that right there. That attitude is exactly why I won't be in your video. Because GNB doesn't care. They hand out pink slips like they're hors d'oevres. Just last week, I was talking to Arthur...",82,26014

26021,6,7,Robin ,Fine. It's Bill Pepper.,90,26022
26022,6,7,Lily ,Bill Pepper? Mm-hmm. Kind of a coincidence there happens to be a bill and a pepper shaker here on the table. Any chance you and Bill had a three-way with Fork Napkin? It's someone we know!,91,26023
26023,6,7,Ted ,"So, I'm assuming you all read the chapters on the Greek Revival architecture. Any questions?",92,26024

26037,6,7,Lily ,He and that little stuffed horsey raised all kinds of hell. But I have a simple method for shutting down troublemakers. You know that '98 Taurus that's always parked outside? The one with the really annoying alarm?,106,26038
26038,6,7,Ted ,We're familiar with it.,107,26039
26039,6,7,Lily ,"Well, when a kid like Johnny acts up in my class...",108,26040
26040,6,7,Lily ,Shuts them right up.,109,26041

26046,6,7,Marshall ,That's the Hermanson contract?,115,26047
26047,6,7,Randy ,"The Hermanson contract? Oh, man, this is the Filbert contract. Damn it! No... (He shredds the file once again) Anyway, what's your thing?",116,26048
26048,6,7,Marshall ,I need the Filbert contract!,117,26049
26049,6,7,Randy ,"Well, I'll do what I can. But in my experience, twice shredded is fairly permanent.",118,26050
26050,6,7,Marshall ,"Sorry, Randy, but... this just isn't working out.",119,26051
26051,6,7,Barney ,"Marshall popped his cherry! Oh! Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster. I mean, it reflected badly on the company. He was an embarrassment. A huge embarrassment.",120,26052
26052,6,7,Lily ,You slept with Randy!,121,26053
26053,6,7,Robin ,What?!,122,26054

26055,6,7,Lily ,"Your co-host is getting super-popular because of her stupid commercial, ""Boats! Boats! Boats!"" So, when you arrived at the GNB party after we left, you were feeling vulnerable and drunk. Then, from across the not-so-crowded conference room, your eyes met. And as we all remember... Randy has a unique condition.",124,26056
26056,6,7,Robin ,"Yeah, your nose is bleeding like a faucet.",125,26057
26057,6,7,Randy ,"Oh, God, this happens every time I get an erection. I am so sorry.",126,26058
26058,6,7,Robin ,That's...exactly what happened.,127,26059
26059,6,7,Barney ,"See, Marshall, if getting fired is an execution, at least the guy had a last meal. I promise you, tomorrow you'll feel a lot better.",128,26060
26060,6,7,Marshall ,"Randy, hey, what's going on?",129,26061
26061,6,7,Randy ,I just wanted to say no hard feelings.,130,26062
26062,6,7,Marshall ,Thank you. So where you headed now?,131,26063

26067,6,7,Marshall ,"Arthur, I'm here because I made a mistake. I fired Randy yesterday.",136,26068
26068,6,7,Arthur ,That was a mistake. You should have fired him a year ago.,137,26069
26069,6,7,Marshall ,"No, sir, that is what's wrong with this company. How can we say ""GNB Cares,"" and then turn around and treat someone like that? I mean, sure, he made a few mistakes but everybody makes mistakes. Like, like Tugboat here. Aw. I bet you he's made some mistakes. And you didn't fire Tugboat, did you?",138,26070
26070,6,7,Arthur ,"No, I got him fixed, and he calmed down.",139,26071
26071,6,7,Marshall ,Exactly-- kind of. Randy doesn't need to be fired. He needs to be fixed.,140,26072
26072,6,7,Arthur ,"Marshall, we do some pretty bad things around here, but I...",141,26073
26073,6,7,Marshall ,"No, sir, I'm saying instead of getting rid of someone when they screw up, we should... we should help them. We should nurture them.",142,26074
26074,6,7,Arthur ,"I changed the ice pack on his crotch every hour for three days. Wow, Eriksen, if you want to un-fire Randy, I support you, because to come in here and say what you just said, well, you've got a couple things that Tugboat doesn't.",143,26075
26075,6,7,Ted ,"Guys, Prof Rock is a really good mix, okay?",144,26076
26076,6,7,Student ,"A piece of New York history is being torn down, and all you could say was ""Boo freakin' hoo""?",145,26077
26077,6,7,Ted ,Boo... freakin'...,146,26078
26078,6,7,Zoey ,I may have mentioned our conversation over a session of hacky sack.,147,26079
26079,6,7,Ted ,"The one day I miss the sack circle, you guys sub her in?",148,26080
26080,6,7,Zoey ,Why'd you miss? Too busy tearing down the Statue of Liberty?,149,26081
26081,6,7,Ted ,No. I was returning a hot dog costume that you all enjoyed.,150,26082
26082,6,7,,"Ted from 2030: They were all turning against me, so I figured, what the hell.",151,26083
26083,6,7,Lily ,And did it work?,152,26084
26084,6,7,Ted ,"Like gangbusters. We're buddies again. After class, we hacked a little sack to the thumpin' strains of my Prof Rock CD. And no, none of them had heard the Pixies B-side. Actually, none of them had heard of the Pixies. Or a B-side.",153,26085
26085,6,7,Randy ,"Hey, guys.",154,26086
26086,6,7,Barney ,"Uh-oh. I know that smile. Lily, there's no easy way to say this. Marshall's dead. Randy m*rder*d him.",155,26087
26087,6,7,Lily ,No. I know why Randy is smiling. You're smiling because of Robin.,156,26088
26088,6,7,Randy ,Robin? Like how I think about her when I'm in the shower?,157,26089
26089,6,7,Ted ,"I'm trying to eat here, buddy.",158,26090
26090,6,7,Lily ,No. Because you slept with her on Halloween.,159,26091
26091,6,7,Randy ,"What? No. I went home, had a shower an-and went to bed.",160,26092
26092,6,7,Lily ,You didn't sleep with her?,161,26093
26093,6,7,Randy ,"No. Even in the shower, the farthest we ever get is hugging.",162,26094
26094,6,7,Lily ,So why are you smiling?,163,26095
26095,6,7,Randy ,I'll tell you why.,164,26096
26096,6,7,Marshall ,This just isn't working out.,165,26097
26097,6,7,,"Randy, thinking: I'm fired. Great. This is the candle kiosk at the mall all over again. Wait a minute. I can get a severance check. If I don't shred it, I can use that money to start my own brewery. Imagine a beer with my name on it. Randy Wharmpiss, this is the best day of your life.",166,26098
26098,6,7,Randy ,"Thanks to that severance check, this time next year, you'll all be enjoying a frothy mug of Wharmpiss.",167,26099

26100,6,7,,"Randy, wailing: No...!",169,26101

26102,6,7,Zoey ,"Hello, Professor. Ha-boom.",171,26103
26103,6,7,Marshall ,"I got you your job back, Randy. I thought that you'd be happy.",172,26104
26104,6,7,Randy ,But I don't belong here. I'm born to be a brewer! A... a hopsmeister!,173,26105
26105,6,7,Marshall ,"Well, then quit. No one's stopping you.",174,26106
26106,6,7,Randy ,I-I can't. I need my severance check.,175,26107
26107,6,7,Marshall ,"Well, I'm sorry Randy, but that's called fraud.",176,26108
26108,6,7,Randy ,It's not fraud. I'm just asking you to get me a lot of money to not work here and not tell anyone about it.,177,26109
26109,6,7,Marshall ,"Even if I wanted to fire you, after my talk with Arthur...",178,26110
26110,6,7,Randy ,"Oh, come on, Arthur can't remember that.",179,26111
26111,6,7,,"Arthur, entering the room: Marshall, what a memorable talk we had yesterday. Randy, on behalf of everyone at GNB, both in and out of prison, we're sorry. And I want to assure you you will never be fired again. You're going to work here until you die, huh? Green tie? (clears throat) Nice choice.",180,26112
26112,6,7,Randy ,Thanks. It brings out my eyes.,181,26113
26113,6,7,Arthur ,Yeah. I'll bring out your eyes.,182,26114
26114,6,7,Marshall ,"Listen, Randy, I'm sorry, but I broke my own moral code once and I felt evil. I will not let GNB change me. I will never fire anyone again ever.",183,26115
26115,6,7,Randy ,"Oh, we'll see about that.",184,26116

26117,6,7,Randy ,No!,186,26118
26118,6,7,Marshall ,What are you doing?,187,26119
26119,6,7,Randy ,"Oh, are you unhappy with my performance? Well, I guess I'm fired, then. I'd better turn in my I.D.",188,26120
26120,6,7,Marshall ,"No, it's actually, um, nice having some of this clutter off my desk. So thank you, Randy.",189,26121
26121,6,7,Randy ,And there's more.,190,26122
26122,6,7,Marshall ,"I don't know what I'm going to use this for, but it's great stuff.",191,26123
26123,6,7,Randy ,Now am I fired?,192,26124
26124,6,7,Marshall ,I've been meaning to clean out that file cabinet for ages.,193,26125
26125,6,7,Barney ,"I'm not even here. Randy, the coffee.",194,26126
26126,6,7,Marshall ,"Oh! Okay. Okay. Thank you, Randy. I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine.",195,26127
26127,6,7,Barney ,"Here, try this, but really go for it. Remember, this guy ruined your life.",196,26128
26128,6,7,Marshall ,That's just the pick-me-up I needed.,197,26129
26129,6,7,Barney ,"Speaking of pickups, can we try the first one again?",198,26130
26130,6,7,Lily ,Hello.,199,26131
26131,6,7,Ted ,It didn't work. They hate me. How do I get them to like me again?,200,26132
26132,6,7,Lily ,"You don't. Ted, you're their teacher. The only people that like their teachers...",201,26133
26133,6,7,Ted ,I like my teachers.,202,26134
26134,6,7,,"Lily:...are dorks. Except for you, Miles. Ted, you just have to learn to embrace their hatred. Because behind that hatred lies fear. And you can use use that fear, like I did with Johnny Marley.",203,26135
26135,6,7,Ted ,Was there more to that story?,204,26136
26136,6,7,Lily ,A little bit.,205,26137
26137,6,7,Ted ,"Lily, you're a psychopath.",206,26138
26138,6,7,Lily ,"A little bit. Oh, a panda!",207,26139
26139,6,7,,Ted from 2030: I thought about Lily's advice. And I figured fear was worth a try.,208,26140
26140,6,7,Zoey ,"Well, Professor Mosby, is there anything you want to say to us?",209,26141
26141,6,7,Ted ,"Anyone not in class tomorrow gets an ""F.""",210,26142
26142,6,7,Lily ,You said that?,211,26143
26143,6,7,Ted ,"Well, technically, they'd get an incomplete, but I thought ""F"" had a nice, scary ring to it. Right?",212,26144
26144,6,7,Lily ,Yeah.,213,26145
26145,6,7,Robin ,"Hey, guys.",214,26146
26146,6,7,Lily ,"Robin, who'd you sleep with?",215,26147
26147,6,7,Robin ,I told you-- Randy. He was a machine.,216,26148
26148,6,7,Lily ,"Where's the poop, Robin?",217,26149
26149,6,7,Robin ,"Fine. I didn't sleep with anyone. The thing is, ever since Becky did that commercial, everyone at work loves her. So, the day after Halloween, I was in a commercial.",218,26150
26150,6,7,Ted ,What... Why didn't you tell us?,219,26151
26151,6,7,Announcer ,"Bladder trouble; it's embarrassing, it's uncomfortable, and it can affect anyone.",220,26152
26152,6,7,Robin ,I'm going to the bathroom right now.,221,26153
26153,6,7,Announcer ,Neat and discreet adult diapers for anyone.,222,26154
26154,6,7,Robin ,"Say... ""Ah...""",223,26155
26155,6,7,Ted ,Wow! I can't wait to see it.,224,26156
26156,6,7,Robin ,"Well, hopefully you never will. They said that they might not even use it.",225,26157
26157,6,7,,Ted from 2030: It ran for seven years.,226,26158
26158,6,7,Randy ,"Okay, you win. Maybe trashing your office was a mistake. It's just, uh, as long as I can remember, making beer has been my dream. Wharmpiss? I know it sounds dumb to someone who's already achieved his dream, big-time lawyer at a huge corporation.",227,26159
26159,6,7,Marshall ,You think working here is my dream?,228,26160
26160,6,7,Randy ,"Of course. Anyways, I'll clean this stuff up. Have someone get that dead squirrel out of your desk.",229,26161
26161,6,7,Marshall ,Randy. This is delicious. You're fired.,230,26162
26162,6,7,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, the next morning, my class had the highest attendance it had ever had. And not long after that, Randy used his severance money to start a little brewery. Now you can have a Wharmpiss at every bar in America. And all because...",231,26163
26163,6,7,Marshall ,I care about making dreams come true. You got what you need?,232,26164
26164,6,7,Barney ,Yep. That's a wrap.,233,26165
26165,6,8,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, one morning in 2010, I opened the newspaper only to discover an op-ed written by Zoey Pierson. You remember Zoey.",1,26166
26166,6,8,Zoey ,Key Ted Mosby's car.,2,26167
26167,6,8,,"Ted from 2030: In those four column inches, she railed against me and my company, GNB, for wanting to tear down a beautiful old building: The Arcadian. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the piece ran on a Saturday, which as you both know, is Dad's crossword day.",3,26168
26168,6,8,Ted ,"She ruined crossword day! I can't believe this. She singles me out by name. Calls me a ""fat cat."" Me and my ""fat-cat friends."" We're not fat cats.",4,26169
26169,6,8,Barney ,"Exactly. I say, Marshall, my good man, how's my bow tie?",5,26170
26170,6,8,Marshall ,"Impeccable, old bean. To industry!",6,26171
26171,6,8,Barney ,"Ah, bully!",7,26172
26172,6,8,,"Ted from 2030: Okay, that night we weren't entirely un-fat-catty. You see, every year the Natural History Museum holds its Autumn Spectacular. It's attended by some of the most powerful and important people in New York, and, thanks to Goliath National Bank... us.",8,26173
26173,6,8,Marshall ,"Look at us, huh? In tuxedos? Can you imagine if our college selves saw us like this?",9,26174
26174,6,8,Ted ,They'd pelt us with their Phish bootlegs.,10,26175
26175,6,8,Marshall ,"Yeah, we were pretty anti-establishment back then. Oh, God, remember Russell?",11,26176
26176,6,8,Marshall ,"Nice monkey suit, Russell.",12,26177
26177,6,8,Russel ,"Come on, guys.",13,26178
26178,6,8,Marshall ,"Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you with that corporate noose around your neck. And don't even try showing up to the drum circle this weekend.",14,26179
26179,6,8,Ted ,"Oh, hey. You guys seen Russell? I'm supposed to drive him to his mom's funeral.",15,26180
26180,6,8,Robin ,I wish I knew you guys back then. You know why? Because you can't kick a story in the nuts.,16,26181
26181,6,8,Lily ,"Hey, we're still those people. One of these days, Marshall's going to quit his job and go to work for the NRDC, and save the world, right, baby?",17,26182
26182,6,8,Marshall ,"Absotively. But let's just remember, I mean, nobody's the same as they were in college. You know, it's like, I wear a suit to work every day.",18,26183
26183,6,8,Lily ,"Well, yeah, but you wear it ironically, like Ted's fanny pack.",19,26184
26184,6,8,Ted ,"Next time we go to Great Adventure, you're carrying your own sunblock.",20,26185
26185,6,8,Lily ,"Ooh! I love this exhibit. One time when I was a kid, this room was closed for cleaning, so I snuck under the rope.",21,26186
26186,6,8,Everyone ,Ooh.,22,26187
26187,6,8,Barney ,"Wow, that's pretty cool. When I was a kid, I knocked down the blue whale.",23,26188
26188,6,8,Marshall ,"Okay, the giant blue whale hanging from the ceiling?",24,26189
26189,6,8,Barney ,"I was six. My uncle Jerry brought me here for the day. He said, ""Don't touch anything"". To a kid. That's like someone telling us ""Don't look at that girl's perky and impossibly symmetrical knockers.""",25,26190
26190,6,8,Everyone ,Ooh.,26,26191
26191,6,8,Robin ,Not bad.,27,26192
26192,6,8,Barney ,"So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale. I'm surprised security didn't stop me on the way in.",28,26193
26193,6,8,Robin ,"Well, I'm sure they don't remember. I mean, it's been like 30 years since that completely made-up story didn't happen.",29,26194
26194,6,8,Barney ,It happened. And these people don't forget. This is not the Natural Stuff That Happened No More Than Five Minutes Ago Museum. Huh?,30,26195
26195,6,8,Arthur ,"Marshall, Barney, there you are. I want you to meet an old friend of mine from Exeter, George Van Smoot.",31,26196
26196,6,8,George ,"But you can, and should, call me The Captain.",32,26197
26197,6,8,Marshall ,The Captain?,33,26198
26198,6,8,Barney ,The Captain?,34,26199

26200,6,8,George ,"Well, ahoy.",36,26201
26201,6,8,Barney ,Ahoy.,37,26202
26202,6,8,Marshall ,"Ahoy, The Captain.",38,26203
26203,6,8,Arthur ,The Captain pretty much paid for this entire shindig.,39,26204
26204,6,8,George ,"Please, enjoy yourselves, have fun, but don't touch anything.",40,26205
26205,6,8,Marshall ,"Thank you, The Captain.",41,26206
26206,6,8,Barney ,Challenge accepted.,42,26207
26207,6,8,Lily ,"Wow. ""The future of Goliath National Bank""?",43,26208
26208,6,8,Marshall ,"I know, it's so, uh... You know, I totally forgot to tell you, but, um, the other day, Arthur offered me a five-year contract.",44,26209
26209,6,8,Lily ,"Oh, well, don't turn him down here in public. I broke up with Scooter at the prom. Right before the picture, too.",45,26210
26210,6,8,Lily ,"So whatever you do, don't tell him here tonight, 'cause...",46,26211
26211,6,8,Marshall ,I think I'm going to say yes.,47,26212
26212,6,8,Barney ,"Ah, that's the stuff.",48,26213
26213,6,8,Robin ,"I didn't realize you were small potatoes. And to be clear, I am referring to your testicles.",49,26214
26214,6,8,Barney ,Impressive. Try this on for size.,50,26215
26215,6,8,Robin ,You want to dance? Let's dance.,51,26216
26216,6,8,Barney ,I live for the dance.,52,26217
26217,6,8,Robin ,Get... your other hand... off my ass.,53,26218
26218,6,8,Barney ,"Sorry, sorry.",54,26219
26219,6,8,Lily ,"What do you mean, you're going to say yes?",55,26220
26220,6,8,Marshall ,I-I want to keep working at GNB.,56,26221
26221,6,8,Lily ,But I thought that you...,57,26222
26222,6,8,Ted ,"Guys, guys, guys? Architecture fun fact: If you stand right here, and you whisper, a person all the way across the other end of the room hears it like you're standing right next to them. It's one of the most sophisticated pieces of acoustical design in the world. Watch. (whispers): Diarrhea. Right? Right?",58,26223
26223,6,8,Lily ,But a five-year contract. I thought you hated GNB.,59,26224
26224,6,8,Marshall ,"Look, I don't hate all of it. Tonight's fun. Take a look around. I mean, this is pretty high-class.",60,26225
26225,6,8,,"Ted, whispering: Poo-poo. Poo-poo platter.",61,26226
26226,6,8,Ted ,"Zoey? Well, well, well.",62,26227
26227,6,8,Zoey ,You have got to be kidding me.,63,26228
26228,6,8,Ted ,"So, what are we protesting tonight? Rising cost of jet fuel? The government's oppressive top hat and monocle tax?",64,26229
26229,6,8,Zoey ,"And what are you doing here? Oh, right. Beautiful old building... you're here to knock it down. Can I finish my drink first?",65,26230
26230,6,8,George ,"Darling, there you are.",66,26231
26231,6,8,Zoey ,"Ted, this is my husband.",67,26232
26232,6,8,Ted ,"Yeah, old stuff's great.",68,26233
26233,6,8,Robin ,"Mmm. Ah, this Scotch is good. How's your drink?",69,26234
26234,6,8,Barney ,"This is ridiculous. We are two grown adults standing among the greatest collection of natural artifacts in the Western hemisphere, and look at what we're doing.",70,26235
26235,6,8,Robin ,You're right.,71,26236
26236,6,8,Barney ,Want to go touch a bunch of stuff?,72,26237
26237,6,8,Robin ,"Yeah, I do.",73,26238
26238,6,8,Ted ,"So, Captain. How'd you get that name, anyway?",74,26239
26239,6,8,George ,Gave it to myself. A real man chooses his own name.,75,26240
26240,6,8,Ted ,"Well, pleased to meet you, Captain. I'm Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville.",76,26241
26241,6,8,Zoey ,This is Ted.,77,26242
26242,6,8,George ,"Capital. Honey, I may cut out early. I have to go check up on the boat.",78,26243
26243,6,8,Ted ,"The boat? There's a boat? You must tell me about this boat, Captain.",79,26244
26244,6,8,George ,"Well, she's an 85-foot sloop.",80,26245
26245,6,8,Ted ,She!,81,26246
26246,6,8,George ,Do you like boats? Does the sea call to you like it calls to me?,82,26247
26247,6,8,Ted ,"Yes. The sea is all like, ""Ted, come hang out.""",83,26248
26248,6,8,George ,I like Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. You're coming on the boat sometime. Stepping off.,84,26249
26249,6,8,Ted ,"Man, I wish me and my dad were as close as you guys are.",85,26250
26250,6,8,Zoey ,Oh. You want to make this personal? Okay. Destroy Ted Mosby. Now it's personal.,86,26251
26251,6,8,Ted ,"No, if I wanted to make it personal, I'd call you a bored little trophy wife who likes to play activist when the shops on 5th Avenue are closed.",87,26252
26252,6,8,Zoey ,You're going down.,88,26253
26253,6,8,Ted ,"Down where? To the yacht club? Oh! I would love to. W-w-wait. I'm half Jewish, will that be a problem?",89,26254
26254,6,8,Lily ,So what about becoming an environmental lawyer? What about saving the world?,90,26255
26255,6,8,,"Ted, whispering: Wieners.",91,26256
26256,6,8,Marshall ,"That was a great dream. But we have a mortgage, and we're trying to have kids. We're grown-ups now, Lily.",92,26257
26257,6,8,Ted ,Wieners and gonads.,93,26258
26258,6,8,Lily ,What would College You say if he heard what you were saying right now?,94,26259
26259,6,8,Marshall ,"Honestly? Probably something pretentious, and pseudo-intellectual, like...",95,26260
26260,6,8,Ted ,Boogers.,96,26261
26261,6,8,Marshall ,"We all change, Lily. You know, you don't spell ""women"" with a ""Y"" anymore. And I'm okay with that. And you need to be okay with the fact that I may never become an environmental lawyer.",97,26262
26262,6,8,Lily ,So how long have you felt this way?,98,26263
26263,6,8,Marshall ,Honestly? Since my first day at GNB.,99,26264
26264,6,8,Ted ,Hershey squirts.,100,26265
26265,6,8,Robin ,"Hey. How do you like my date's tux? Ooh! Uh, a-thank you! Oh, none for him. He's stuffed.",101,26266
26266,6,8,Ted ,"Oh! Zoey! There you are. Oh, my God. You have a monocle. Is this real? Is this really happening?",102,26267
26267,6,8,Zoey ,Can you excuse us for a moment? Let's go for a walk.,103,26268
26268,6,8,Ted ,Good luck killing James Bond. (Zoey takes Ted away) Are we allowed in here?,104,26269
26269,6,8,Zoey ,What do you want from me?,105,26270
26270,6,8,Ted ,"I want my crossword day back. Okay? Go live your perfect little life, and leave me the hell alone.",106,26271
26271,6,8,Zoey ,My life isn't perfect.,107,26272
26272,6,8,Ted ,"Oh, please, what's your biggest problem? Having to sail back to the marina because the Captain's all out of white Zin? Oh. Great. Now you're crying. Like that's going to get my sympathy.",108,26273
26273,6,8,,Ted from 2030: It did.,109,26274
26274,6,8,Lily ,"You've known about this for two and a half years? So every time you've talked about wanting to be an environmental lawyer since then, that was a lie.",110,26275
26275,6,8,Marshall ,"Technically, I never lied. You asked me questions, and I responded with made-up words.",111,26276
26276,6,8,Lily ,What?,112,26277
26277,6,8,Lily ,"So, you'll probably quit GNB in a couple years, right?",113,26278
26278,6,8,Marshall ,Affirmatootly.,114,26279
26279,6,8,Lily ,And become an environmental lawyer?,115,26280

26283,6,8,Marshall ,Lawyered.,119,26284
26284,6,8,Lily ,"Okay, that's also a made-up word.",120,26285
26285,6,8,Marshall ,"Okay. Lily, what do you want from me? I want you to be the person I fell in love with.",121,26286
26286,6,8,Barney ,Niled it.,122,26287
26287,6,8,Museum guard, Excuse me.,123,26288
26288,6,8,Barney ,Thank God you're here. She's been messing with the exhibits.,124,26289
26289,6,8,Zoey ,I got married when I was 22 to a man who calls himself The Captain.,125,26290
26290,6,8,Ted ,He seems like a good guy. He wears those red pants.,126,26291
26291,6,8,Zoey ,"I hate boats, Ted. I do, I hate 'em. I can't be on them. I can't be near them. I can't even think about them without getting seasick. You want to know why I want to save that building? Because when I look up at The Arcadian, I see something big and solid, and right now everything else in my life just feels like I'm on a boat. I know it's crazy to care that much about a building.",127,26292
26292,6,8,Ted ,"It's not crazy at all. I'm the same way. Look, Zoey, The Arcadian should be a landmark, it should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate that we have to tear it down. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of wieners and gonads.",128,26293
26293,6,8,Zoey ,"Ted, that was... really easy.",129,26294
26294,6,8,Ted ,What?,130,26295
26295,6,8,,Ted's voice (on a recording): They're a bunch of wieners and gonads.,131,26296

26297,6,8,,"Ted from 2030: And in that moment, another headline appeared before my eyes.",133,26298
26298,6,8,Ted ,You tricked me.,134,26299
26299,6,8,Zoey ,"Well, it the bug room, Ted. Your ass just got bugged. Oh, the offer still stands. We simply must have you out on the boat sometime.",135,26300
26300,6,8,Guard ,"Well, aren't you two clever. Well, guess what, this museum has seen every kind of prank you can think of. Mummies playing poker, penguins sticking out of volcanoes, dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period hanging out with dinosaurs from the Jurassic period. One time a kid knocked down the blue whale. You name it...",136,26301
26301,6,8,Robin ,I'm sorry. Did you say someone knocked down the blue whale?,137,26302
26302,6,8,Guard ,"Oh no, not just someone. A six-year-old.",138,26303
26303,6,8,Barney ,"Oh, yeah, that story is legend... (phone ringing) Hold on....dary. And, um, would you happen to know what that young man's name was?",139,26304
26304,6,8,Guard ,"No. But I could, uh, check the files.",140,26305
26305,6,8,Barney ,Thank you.,141,26306

26308,6,8,George ,So I hear my wife got you pretty good.,144,26309
26309,6,8,Ted ,She caught me on tape trashing GNB.,145,26310
26310,6,8,George ,"Oh, that damn recorder. Try being married to that. ""But you said you'd get the corgis neutered this weekend."" ""I said no such thing."" ""Oh, yeah?"" Click. You're a good guy, Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. Tell you what, when Zoey goes to sleep, I'll find that tape and erase it for you. No hard feelings.",146,26311
26311,6,8,Ted ,Really? You'd do that to your own wife?,147,26312
26312,6,8,George ,"Sure. Why not? I mean, I'm glad she has these little causes, they keep her out of troubles, but when she throws a temper tantrum and it gets in the way of someone doing their job, that's a problem.",148,26313
26313,6,8,Ted ,"No, you know what? Don't erase the tape. And for what it's worth, I don't think she's throwing temper tantrums. I just think she's, you know, standing up for what she believes in. I respect that.",149,26314
26314,6,8,George ,"Hey, what about this? I'll take you out on the boat sometime. You've got to see this boat. She's breathtaking.",150,26315

26320,6,8,Guard ,Uncle Jerry. Says father. Even signed it and checked the box for father and everything.,156,26321
26321,6,8,Barney ,Jerry's my uncle.,157,26322
26322,6,8,College Marshall," Lily? Honey, what's wrong? You okay? Do you want a hit of this sandwich?",158,26323
26323,6,8,Lily ,I want you.,159,26324
26324,6,8,College Marshall, Awesome. Let me just put a sock on the doorknob.,160,26325
26325,6,8,,"Lily:No. I mean, I want you as opposed to who you've become. You've changed so much.",161,26326
26326,6,8,College Marshall, What? How have I changed? Did I cheat on you?,162,26327
26327,6,8,Lily ,No.,163,26328
26328,6,8,College Marshall, Did I stop writing poems for you?,164,26329
26329,6,8,Lily ,"Yes, but I'm okay with that.",165,26330
26330,6,8,College Marshall," Am I not as good at making the sweet, sweet love to you?",166,26331
26331,6,8,Lily ,"Actually, you're way better now. You last, like, two, three times as long.",167,26332
26332,6,8,College Marshall, You said that any longer would be too much.,168,26333
26333,6,8,Lily ,"It's okay. College Lily thinks those are orgasms. No, it's... it's none of that. It's just this new Marshall... Corporate Marshall... he wears suits all the time. He doesn't care about saving the world. He's not you. I want you back.",169,26334
26334,6,8,College Marshall," Well, you can't have me. Look at the sign. I'm extinct. I've gone the way of Jane's Addiction.",170,26335
26335,6,8,Lily ,"Actually, Jane's Addiction got back together.",171,26336
26336,6,8,College Marshall, They did?,172,26337
26337,6,8,Lily ,"Yeah, they've done a few tours, they put out a new album.",173,26338
26338,6,8,College Marshall, Are you serious?! That is awesome! Are they just as good?,174,26339
26339,6,8,Lily ,Sure.,175,26340
26340,6,8,College Marshall," Look, I know that Corporate Marshall wears a tie and everything, but it sounds like he hasn't changed where it counts.",176,26341
26341,6,8,Marshall ,Hey.,177,26342
26342,6,8,Lily ,Hi.,178,26343
26343,6,8,Marshall ,"Look, Lily, I know that you would have been okay if we were poor and I was trying to save the world, but will you still be okay if I make a lot of money and I spend all of it spoiling you and our kids?",179,26344
26344,6,8,Lily ,We'll make it work.,180,26345
26345,6,8,College Marshall, There he goes. The Marathon Man. Mr. Stamina himself. I can kiss better than that old man.,181,26346
26346,6,8,Robin ,So when was the last time you saw him?,182,26347
26347,6,8,Barney ,"It was that day... July 23, 1981. My mom got pretty mad that he let me destroy a New York City landmark.",183,26348
26348,6,8,Robin ,Moms.,184,26349
26349,6,8,Barney ,He never came around anymore after that. Think he moved away.,185,26350
26350,6,8,Robin ,"Well, maybe the security guy had it wrong. You never know...",186,26351
26351,6,8,Barney ,"But you do know, you do know. That's the thing. You know. He's my dad.",187,26352
26352,6,8,Robin ,"Barney, do you want...?",188,26353
26353,6,8,Barney ,"I don't want to do anything. Don't tell anyone about this, okay?",189,26354
26354,6,8,Ted ,"I'm serious. It's a great look. I think it could come back, but one question. Does it cost half as much as glasses?",190,26355
26355,6,8,Zoey ,Can I steal you for a second? You don't need to worry. I... What are you doing?,191,26356
26356,6,8,Ted ,"Oh, I thought we were...",192,26357
26357,6,8,Zoey ,Fine. I erased the tape.,193,26358
26358,6,8,Ted ,What?,194,26359
26359,6,8,Zoey ,I don't need it. I'm going to beat you fair and square.,195,26360
26360,6,8,Ted ,Thanks.,196,26361
26361,6,8,Zoey ,But it's good to know how easily you can be manipulated by a woman.,197,26362
26362,6,8,Ted ,"You look gross when you cry, you know that? Some women look cute. You look like a basset hound.",198,26363
26363,6,8,Zoey ,"Oh, laugh it up now. Because starting Monday, I got you in my crosshairs.",199,26364
26364,6,8,Ted ,"Bring it on, Princess.",200,26365
26365,6,8,Arthur ,"Eriksen... It's, uh, 3:00 a.m. You know what, you might as well not even go home.",201,26366
26366,6,8,,"Ted from 2030: And so Marshall stayed right on at Goliath National Bank. Of course, it wouldn't last forever. But that's another story.",202,26367
26367,6,9,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, in the fall of 2010, it seemed like Aunt Lily could only talk about one thing: babies.",1,26368
26368,6,9,Robin ,"Oh, God, I have been craving this burger all day.",2,26369
26369,6,9,Lily ,Do you know what plays a huge role in helping a woman conceive? Cervical mucus.,3,26370
26370,6,9,Robin ,"Oh, my God, I can't wait to see this movie. I hear it's really scary.",4,26371
26371,6,9,Lily ,"Oh, change of plans. I thought violent images wouldn't be good for my future fetus, so instead, I rented this video of a live water birth.",5,26372
26372,6,9,Robin ,They don't know what it is. It just showed up on my mom's X-ray.,6,26373
26373,6,9,Lily ,Look at this crib.,7,26374
26374,6,9,,"Ted from 2030: But all in all, it wasn't a problem. That is, until the night of Barney's boutonniere.",8,26375
26375,6,9,Marshall ,"Oh, you're wearing a flower.",9,26376
26376,6,9,Barney ,Thank you.,10,26377
26377,6,9,Marshall ,"Ah, didn't compliment. Just observed.",11,26378
26378,6,9,Barney ,I know. Isn't it?,12,26379
26379,6,9,Robin ,Why are you wearing that?,13,26380
26380,6,9,Ted ,Why does Barney do anything ever?,14,26381
26381,6,9,Barney ,"Exactly. Science. There is an 83% correlation between the times men wear boutonnieres and the times they get laid. Think about it. Proms, weddings. Grandmas' funerals. Thanks for the redhead, Nana. The ""everyday boutonniere"" by Stinson.",15,26382
26382,6,9,Robin ,"And nope. I'm sorry, Barney, but no girl is going home with a guy with a flower on his chest. Unless he's a clown, and she's in the trunk of his car.",16,26383
26383,6,9,Marshall ,Along with 50 other clowns. It's a clown car. Oh.,17,26384
26384,6,9,Barney ,"Robin, did you know that boutonniere is French for ""bootie is near?"" True story. Une histoire vraie.",18,26385
26385,6,9,Robin ,"Hmm! Did you know that Barney is French for ""sad little guy who works way too hard to get laid""""",19,26386
26386,6,9,Barney ,"Woman, you best check yourself.",20,26387
26387,6,9,Robin ,"Yeah, on the bright side, I guess suits are pretty boring without them, so...",21,26388
26388,6,9,Barney ,Madam... that is an insult that cannot be borne! I demand satisfaction!,22,26389
26389,6,9,Robin ,"What, are we gonna duel?",23,26390
26390,6,9,Barney ,"No. I'm going to show everyone this embarrassing video of you. It's Robin Sparkles III, y'all!",24,26391
26391,6,9,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, by this point, we knew Aunt Robin had been a teen pop sensation in Canada, known as Robin Sparkles. And we also knew that her Robin Sparkles character came from a Canadian TV show, which we'd never seen... until now.",25,26392
26392,6,9,Barney ,I cannot wait to see what's on this DVD!,26,26393
26393,6,9,Marshall ,"Oh, you haven't watched it yet?",27,26394
26394,6,9,Barney ,"No, of course not. I wanted my first time to be with someone I cared about.",28,26395
26395,6,9,Marshall ,"Sweet! I get that a lot. Well, once.",29,26396
26396,6,9,Lily ,"Hey, Robin, do you want to go get a Korean massage on Saturday?",30,26397
26397,6,9,Robin ,"Oh, I'd love to. I've got this knot in my neck that's so annoying.",31,26398
26398,6,9,Lily ,"Yeah, I figured I should get one now because once I get pregnant, no more massages. Just so annoying.",32,26399
26399,6,9,Barney ,Space Teens?! Is this a porno?,33,26400
26400,6,9,Robin ,"No, no. Dude, dude. Sweet! It's a kids' show.",34,26401
26401,6,9,Ted ,"I don't know. This does have all the earmarks of p*rn. Stripper pole, bad lighting, delusional girl who thinks it's a stepping stone to mainstream success.",35,26402
26402,6,9,Barney ,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big old bowl of pornflakes. Whoa! And who is this exquisite keytarist I assum you're about to make sweet love to?",36,26403
26403,6,9,Robin ,"Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life.",37,26404
26404,6,9,Barney ,"Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers? Get mad at each other and wrestle, but then end up kissing in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily.",38,26405
26405,6,9,Robin ,"Barney, you know what? If you're going to be disgusting, we're not watching this, okay?",39,26406
26406,6,9,Lily ,"Yeah. Come on, Barney. It's just a cute little story about... What exactly is this about?",40,26407
26407,6,9,Robin ,"Oh, two average Canadian teenagers who solve crimes in space using math.",41,26408
26408,6,9,Marshall ,That sounds ridiculous.,42,26409
26409,6,9,Robin Sparkles, So sue me. Like the producers of Milky Way Mathletes tried to.,43,26410
26410,6,9,Jessica Glitter," Great job using long division to catch that space burglar, eh?",44,26411
26411,6,9,Robin Sparkles," Well, what can I say? He'll be in galactic jail for the remainder of his life.",45,26412
26412,6,9,Robot ,"Sparkles, Glitter, we're about to enter an asteroid belt, eh.",46,26413
26413,6,9,Robin Sparkles, Brace for turbulence!,47,26414
26414,6,9,Lily ,"Oh. Oh. I have to say, as much as I hate to agree with Barney, this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia.",48,26415
26415,6,9,Robin ,"Okay, guys, come on. It's a kids' show! Like Electric Company or Sesame Street or, um...",49,26416
26416,6,9,Marshall ,You can't do that on television.,50,26417
26417,6,9,Robin ,Exactly.,51,26418
26418,6,9,Marshall ,No. You can't do that on television!,52,26419
26419,6,9,Ted ,"Robin, this show is so dirty, I don't know whether to hug you or run a shower for you so you can sit there alone, crying and clenching your knees.",53,26420
26420,6,9,Robin ,"It's just bad camera work, okay? Wayne, our camera guy... he wasn't that great.",54,26421
26421,6,9,Marshall ,"I don't know. I think he did a pretty good job, considering he was probably only using one hand.",55,26422
26422,6,9,Robin ,"You know what? I feel bad for you Americans, that you can look at this wondrous and educational adventure through space, and see something obscene. Can you just please try to look at this with the innocence of a child?",56,26423
26423,6,9,Man ,"Coming up. Here we go. Girls, if you want to get through the asteroid belt, you've got to use multiplication. To the joystick! Okay, Space Teens, let's multiply! Five times six?",57,26424
26424,6,9,Robin Sparkles, Oh. 30.,58,26425
26425,6,9,Man ,Yes! Oh! Seven times four?,59,26426
26426,6,9,Jessica Glitter, 28!,60,26427
26427,6,9,Man ,Keep going! Eight times nine?,61,26428
26428,6,9,Jessica Glitter, 72!,62,26429
26429,6,9,Man ,Don't stop now! Almost there! 23 times three?,63,26430
26430,6,9,Barney ,"I'm sorry. We got to ration this. It's like we're on a desert island, and this video is a really hot, naked chick, and she's got, like, seaweed on her and a seashell bra. You all feel me?",64,26431
26431,6,9,Lily ,"Hey, if you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her?",65,26432
26432,6,9,Robin ,"Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card from her every year, but we're not really friends anymore.",66,26433
26433,6,9,Lily ,But BFFs are forever.,67,26434
26434,6,9,Marshall ,"Oh, come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends with their high school friends.",68,26435
26435,6,9,Ted ,I'm still friends with Punchy.,69,26436
26436,6,9,Marshall ,"Dude, he lives in Cleveland. You see him once a year, at which point, he punches you really hard in the arm and tells everyone how you dookied your pants. I know, on paper he sounds great, but you guys aren't really friends.",70,26437
26437,6,9,Ted ,"Look, I may not see him a lot, but it doesn't matter. Observe.",71,26438
26438,6,9,Punchy ,Schmosby!,72,26439
26439,6,9,Ted ,Punchy!,73,26440
26440,6,9,Punchy ,"Hey, good talking to you, Ted.",74,26441
26441,6,9,Ted ,"Yeah, you, too. If you're ever in New York.",75,26442
26442,6,9,Punchy ,Definitely.,76,26443
26443,6,9,Ted ,We are just two peas.,77,26444
26444,6,9,Lily ,I don't get it. How can you and Glitter just stop being friends? Best friends don't do that.,78,26445
26445,6,9,Robin ,"Well, we did, okay? And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it. I got to go.",79,26446
26446,6,9,Lily ,Whoa. What do you think came between Robin and Jessica?,80,26447
26447,6,9,Ted ,"Much like our friends, the Space Teens, I think I can solve this crime with math. Okay... Okay, here is a Christmas card that Jessica sent Robin. Lily, how old would you say that kid is?",81,26448
26448,6,9,Lily ,"Four years, three months.",82,26449
26449,6,9,Ted ,Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago. Right around the time she and Robin stopped being friends.,83,26450
26450,6,9,Marshall ,Of course. Robin hates kids.,84,26451
26451,6,9,Barney ,The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat.,85,26452
26452,6,9,Ted ,"Thus, if I may... When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear, Robin said, ""To hell with this, I'm outta hare. Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her.",86,26453
26453,6,9,Marshall ,"That's got to be it, right, Lil? Lil?",87,26454
26454,6,9,Lily ,Robin's gonna dump me!,88,26455
26455,6,9,Marshall ,"Oh, sweetheart.",89,26456
26456,6,9,Ted ,When a second uterus plumped becomes...,90,26457
26457,6,9,Marshall ,Dude. Feel the room.,91,26458
26458,6,9,Robin ,No.,92,26459
26459,6,9,Ted ,We've been waiting all day!,93,26460
26460,6,9,Robin ,Just watch it without me.,94,26461
26461,6,9,Barney ,Two dudes on the couch together watching p*rn? That's kind of weird.,95,26462
26462,6,9,Robin ,"Okay, it's not p*rn, it's a kids' show.",96,26463
26463,6,9,Ted ,Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse.,97,26464
26464,6,9,Robin ,"Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off.",98,26465
26465,6,9,Barney ,We...,99,26466
26466,6,9,Robin ,I'm serious.,100,26467
26467,6,9,Robin Sparkles," Hey Jessica, how's your beaver?",101,26468
26468,6,9,Jessica Glitter, Great. How's your beaver?,102,26469
26469,6,9,Robin Sparkles, Busy as ever!,103,26470
26470,6,9,Robin ,Our characters had pet beavers.,104,26471
26471,6,9,Ted ,Sure.,105,26472
26472,6,9,Robin ,The beaver is the official animal of Canada. It's our national mascot.,106,26473
26473,6,9,Barney ,It's a noble creature.,107,26474
26474,6,9,Man ,"Okay, girls. Everyone knows a beaver's favorite food is wood. I just hope we brought along enough of it for our three-day galactic space journey. So let's do the math. If Robin's beaver devours six inches of wood every half hour, and Jessica's beaver devours eight inches of wood every 45 minutes, how much wood will I need to keep both of these beavers well-fed all weekend long? While you figure it out at home, how about we sing you a song about our beavers?",108,26475
26475,6,9,Robin ,"Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable!",109,26476
26476,6,9,Barney ,No arguments here.,110,26477
26477,6,9,Punchy ,'Sup Shmosby!,111,26478
26478,6,9,Ted ,"Punchy, what are you doing here?",112,26479
26479,6,9,Punchy ,"Well, yesterday you said if I was ever in New York. 'Sup, turds?",113,26480
26480,6,9,Ted ,"Okay, uh, uh, where are you staying?",114,26481
26481,6,9,,"Punchy:In your mom's pants. Trick. She's old. Hey, don't worry about me. I'm cool on the couch.",115,26482
26482,6,9,Robin ,Whoa. He's staying here? You're staying here?,116,26483
26483,6,9,Punchy ,"I know! It's so good, right? Feel like you're dreaming? But check your totem, brah. Punchy's here in the flesh. So, why don't we get one of these, Ted? Yeah. Remember these? High school? Junior high? Yeah. Elementary school? Remember those?",117,26484
26484,6,9,Punchy ,"Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied in your pants down by the lake? Unbelievable!",118,26485
26485,6,9,Robin ,"Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied on our couch in the form of your idiot high school friend? Unbelievable!",119,26486
26486,6,9,Ted ,Come on. I worry about the guy. He's had the same dead-end job at a car rental place for 15 years.,120,26487
26487,6,9,Robin ,Don't care.,121,26488
26488,6,9,Ted ,He's been stuck in Cleveland his whole life.,122,26489
26489,6,9,Robin ,Get a hotel.,123,26490
26490,6,9,Ted ,Robin... LeBron.,124,26491
26491,6,9,Robin ,"Okay, one night. Got to go.",125,26492
26492,6,9,Lily ,Where are you going? We just got here.,126,26493
26493,6,9,Robin ,"Oh, a Korean massage.",127,26494
26494,6,9,Lily ,By yourself?,128,26495
26495,6,9,Robin ,"Well, I figured you'd be busy, reading What to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect.",129,26496
26496,6,9,Lily ,"Guys, did you see that? She's going to a Korean massage without me. That's our thing. I'm telling you, she's gonna dump me, just like she dumped Glitter.",130,26497
26497,6,9,Marshall ,"Lily, come on. We don't even know that's what happened.",131,26498
26498,6,9,Ted ,"Um, hello, somebody already solved that crime using math, remember?",132,26499
26499,6,9,Marshall ,"Look, Lily. Robin is clearly getting tired of you constantly talking about babies.",133,26500
26500,6,9,Lily ,I don't.,134,26501
26501,6,9,Marshall ,"Lily, how old am I?",135,26502
26502,6,9,Lily ,384 months.,136,26503
26503,6,9,Punchy ,Busted!,137,26504
26504,6,9,Marshall ,"Okay. So before you Lily all over the place, maybe you should try hanging out with Robin and not talking about babies.",138,26505
26505,6,9,,Ted from 2030: So Lily did just that. She tried not to talk about babies.,139,26506
26506,6,9,Robin ,"Hey, Lily, what brings you to the crib?",140,26507
26507,6,9,Lily ,Crib...,141,26508
26508,6,9,Robin ,What's the matter? You look rattled.,142,26509
26509,6,9,Lily ,Rattled? I want to talk about babies.,143,26510
26510,6,9,Robin ,What?,144,26511
26511,6,9,Lily ,"Look, I know you don't care about this stuff, but I'm about to become a mother. And as a future mother, I'm gonna need the support...",145,26512
26512,6,9,Robin ,"Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet.",146,26513
26513,6,9,Lily ,What's that supposed to mean?,147,26514
26514,6,9,Robin ,"It means that a fertilized egg has not yet attached itself to the lining of your uterine wall. You see? I read your Facebook updates. God, it's like it's all you ever talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it!",148,26515
26515,6,9,Lily ,"Well, guess what? I've got some good news. When that baby comes, you don't have to see it. In fact, you don't have to see me. This whole friendship thing? Done.",149,26516
26516,6,9,Robin ,Great.,150,26517
26517,6,9,Lily ,Great.,151,26518
26518,6,9,Marshall ,For crying out loud. You broke up with Robin?,152,26519
26519,6,9,Lily ,"I had to. We were growing apart, and we're better off without each other.",153,26520
26520,6,9,Marshall ,"Okay, Lily, you sound about as convincing as you did the time you ""accidentally"" shredded my Joey Buttafuoco pants.",154,26521
26521,6,9,Lily ,No!,155,26522
26522,6,9,Marshall ,"Get on the phone, call Robin and fix this.",156,26523
26523,6,9,Lily ,I can't. The damage is done. Can you just hold me?,157,26524
26524,6,9,Marshall ,"You know what? No. I don't agree with what you did, and so I refuse to comfort you, despite how adorable you are when you cry.",158,26525
26525,6,9,Lily ,Okay.,159,26526
26526,6,9,Marshall ,"Okay. Maybe just one cuddle, but then that is it.",160,26527
26527,6,9,Punchy ,Times Square's the b*mb! I got so many great pictures of all the billboards.,161,26528
26528,6,9,Ted ,"Yeah. You know, there's more to New York than Times Square. There's the Village, the Lower East Side, Central Park...",162,26529
26529,6,9,Punchy ,They got better billboards then the ones in Times Square?,163,26530
26530,6,9,Ted ,No.,164,26531
26531,6,9,Punchy ,Times Square's the b*mb!,165,26532
26532,6,9,Ted ,"Here. You know what? Hold this, okay?",166,26533
26533,6,9,Punchy ,I'm going to go pee in the jar I got going in the alley.,167,26534
26534,6,9,Barney ,"Seriously, dude, he has got to go. You need to be like, ""You are the weakest link. Goodbye."" Punchy, the tribe has spoken. Please pack up your knives and go. Your work of art didn't work for us. Your time's up. I have to ask you to leave the mansion. You must leave the chateau. Your tour ends here. You've been chopped.",168,26535
26535,6,9,Ted ,"Okay, yeah. I know.",169,26536
26536,6,9,Barney ,"You've been evicted from the Big Brother house. Your dessert just didn't measure up. Sashay away. Give me your jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen. I'm sorry, you did not get a rose. You have been eliminated from the race. You are no longer in the running to be America's Next Top Model. You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen.",170,26537
26537,6,9,Punchy ,"Ted, come look at this. I found a little wounded bird in the alley.",171,26538
26538,6,9,Ted ,That's your scrotum.,172,26539
26539,6,9,Punchy ,"You know what it is, Ted. You know what it is. Come on, Ted. You always fall for that.",173,26540
26540,6,9,Ted ,"Yeah, he's gotta go.",174,26541
26541,6,9,Lily ,What are we doing in Madison Square Garden?,175,26542
26542,6,9,Marshall ,"Okay, you refused to talk to Robin. So I thought that you might like to talk to... the organist for the New York Rangers. Jessica Glitter?!",176,26543
26543,6,9,Lily ,How did you find Glitter?,177,26544
26544,6,9,Marshall ,"Simple, really. I used my powers of deduction. You see, I knew Glitter used to be a keytarist, which is basically a piano, so I just made a list of all the keyboard-based occupations and then I cross-matched them...",178,26545
26545,6,9,Jessica Glitter," His friend Barney looked me up, hoping to buy my Space Teens costume.",179,26546
26546,6,9,Marshall ,"Yo, Glitter... Be cool.",180,26547
26547,6,9,Jessica Glitter," So, is this the one who's best friends with Robin now?",181,26548
26548,6,9,Lily ,More like ex-best friends. Just like you.,182,26549
26549,6,9,Jessica Glitter, I'm sorry to hear that. I miss Robin.,183,26550
26550,6,9,Lily ,"Yeah, well, Marshall and I are about to get pregnant, and I know she stopped being friends with you when you had a baby, so...",184,26551
26551,6,9,Jessica Glitter," Oh, Robin didn't stop being friends with me. I stopped being friends with her.",185,26552
26552,6,9,Lily ,What? Why?,186,26553
26553,6,9,Jessica Glitter," Because I had a baby. Honey, when you have a baby, all that best friend stuff-- hockey, bow hunting for caribou, math...that all goes out the window. I mean, I tried to stay friends with her, but it just didn't happen. She took it pretty hard. I even thought she might try to k*ll herself.",187,26554
26554,6,9,Marshall ,Charge!,188,26555
26555,6,9,Lily ,Wow. You dumped her just because you had a baby? That's cold.,189,26556
26556,6,9,Jessica Glitter, Didn't you do the same thing? Minus the baby?,190,26557
26557,6,9,Lily ,"Oh, God. I gotta go. I gotta go apologize to Robin. I- I need to tell her I love her, and that she'll always be a priority.",191,26558
26558,6,9,Jessica Glitter," Be careful, Lily. I made those promises, too. And now I haven't even talked to her in five years. Sure, I thought about picking up the phone and calling her a hundred times, but I just never have the courage to actually...(Marshall is playing the piano) Hey. Go ahead.",192,26559
26559,6,9,Punchy ,"Hey, do you guys get Big Chuck and Little John out here?",193,26560
26560,6,9,Ted ,"Punchy, it's time to go back.",194,26561
26561,6,9,Punchy ,Back to Times Square?!,195,26562
26562,6,9,Ted ,"Uh, no. Back-Back to Cleveland.",196,26563
26563,6,9,Punchy ,"I don't know if I can do that, bro. I mean, yeah, I've been jonesing for a piece of Cleveland-style pizza, but I feel bad about leaving you out here. I worry about you, Ted.",197,26564
26564,6,9,Ted ,You worry about me?,198,26565
26565,6,9,Punchy ,"Yeah. The other day, when you called...",199,26566
26566,6,9,Punchy ,Schmosby!,200,26567
26567,6,9,Ted ,Punchy!,201,26568
26568,6,9,Punchy ,"Hey, good talking to you, Ted.",202,26569
26569,6,9,Ted ,"Yeah. You, too. If you're ever in New York...",203,26570
26570,6,9,Punchy ,Definitely.,204,26571
26571,6,9,Woman ,"Sweetie, who was that?",205,26572
26572,6,9,Punchy ,It was my friend Ted. He sounded kind of depressed.,206,26573
26573,6,9,Woman ,Is this the Ted who got left at the altar?,207,26574
26574,6,9,Punchy ,"Yeah. He's not doing so good. Poor guy lives in a tiny apartment in New York, nowhere near Times Square. He's got no family around. He's still single, doesn't have a backyard. It's just a bummer.",208,26575
26575,6,9,Woman ,"Maybe you should go visit him. Cheer him up a little. You know, buy him some shots, do the whole wounded bird trick.",209,26576
26576,6,9,Punchy ,You think that would work?,210,26577
26577,6,9,Woman ,Worked on me.,211,26578
26578,6,9,Ted ,"Wow. She sounds pretty great, Punchy.",212,26579
26579,6,9,Punchy ,"She's my angel. In fact, uh... We're getting married.",213,26580
26580,6,9,Ted ,Wow! Wow! That's... I'm-I'm really happy for you.,214,26581
26581,6,9,Punchy ,"Thanks, Ted. Thanks. Actually, that's the other reason why I came out here. I wanted to see if you'd be my best man.",215,26582
26582,6,9,Ted ,Of course I will.,216,26583
26583,6,9,Punchy ,"Yeah! That's great! No, you're stupid. Oh, that's it...",217,26584

26585,6,9,Lily ,"Oh, there you are. Robin, I owe you a huge apology.",219,26586
26586,6,9,Robin ,"No, okay? Me first. I've been pulling away from you, and I'm sorry. It's just, the last time my best friend had a baby...",220,26587
26587,6,9,Lily ,I know. I know all about it. It's not gonna happen with you and me. And I'm sorry I've been going crazy with this baby stuff. I know you hate babies.,221,26588
26588,6,9,Robin ,"Whoa. Look, I hate most babies. But your baby? I'm gonna love that kid so much. I'm gonna pick it up and everything.",222,26589
26589,6,9,Marshall ,I'm so happy you guys made up.,223,26590
26590,6,9,Ted ,"Me, too.",224,26591
26591,6,9,Barney ,Where do I know this song from?,225,26592

26596,6,9,Marshall ,"Come on, Barney. It's a sweet song about friendship.",230,26597

They called her a bitch, but deep down, they know she's right. And they're about to walk through that door, where we will be waiting with some light beer and some rock hard approval.

26706,6,10,Barney ,"Full disclosure. We also used all your butter, greasing up Lily so we could see how far we could slide her down the hall.",104,26707
26707,6,10,Lily ,"But if it helps, I reached 4G.",105,26708
26708,6,10,Ted ,It doesn't help. 4G? No. What-What are we supposed to do now?,106,26709
26709,6,10,Steve ,This is awesome! I'm part of this!,107,26710
26710,6,10,Ted ,"Barney, I don't know if the oven is deep enough. Plus, it's a display made of cardboard.",108,26711
26711,6,10,Barney ,Huh. I should probably disconnect the gas.,109,26712
26712,6,10,Marshall ,"Hey, just so you guys know, there was a tiny expl*si*n at the sewage treatment plant across the street from our apartment, but I'm sure it's fine by now.",110,26713
26713,6,10,Steve ,This is awesome!,111,26714
26714,6,10,Ted ,It's not awesome!,112,26715
26715,6,10,Robin ,I think the smaller turkey just tried to crawl further inside the bigger turkey.,113,26716
26716,6,10,Barney ,Um... Um... I'm have... I'm having trouble breathing!,114,26717
26717,6,10,Steve ,"Mom keeps an extra litter box in here. There you go. Good as new. Oh. Hey, Ginger.",115,26718
26718,6,10,Lily ,"Ted, you're not gonna like this, but we do have one other option.",116,26719
26719,6,10,Zoey ,"Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone anyway.",117,26720
26720,6,10,Lily ,Could we bring Ted?,118,26721
26721,6,10,Zoey ,It's Thanksgiving. What the hell?,119,26722
26722,6,10,Ted ,No. Absolutely not.,120,26723
26723,6,10,Lily ,Come on. Give her a chance.,121,26724
26724,6,10,Robin ,"Ted, you violated a dead turkey with another dead turkey. Don't let that be in vain.",122,26725
26725,6,10,Marshall ,Guys? Wait a minute. Where's Barney?,123,26726
26726,6,10,Barney ,"And here's the twist, Babaka. Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz.",124,26727
26727,6,10,Babaka ,"But Barney, now you left the group. Wouldn't that put you in danger of becoming The Blitz yourself?",125,26728
26728,6,10,Barney ,No. I c... Because... Step on it.,126,26729
26729,6,10,Marshall ,You missed it.,127,26730
26730,6,10,Steve ,"Oh, my goodness. Our cab took a wrong turn. We were in the Thanksgiving Day parade!",128,26731
26731,6,10,Robin ,"Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike and he sang ""Twist and Shout!""",129,26732
26732,6,10,Barney ,But he's The Blitz.,130,26733
26733,6,10,Ted ,No. I'm not The Blitz. I'm The Bueller. You know what this means. You're The Blitz.,131,26734
26734,6,10,Mysterious voice, Blitz...,132,26735
26735,6,10,Barney ,"Oh, God, no!",133,26736
26736,6,10,Marshall ,"Life moves pretty fast, Barney. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it.",134,26737
26737,6,10,Ted ,Chicka-chicka!,135,26738
26738,6,10,Zoey ,Happy Thanksgiving! Ted.,136,26739
26739,6,10,Ted ,Zoey.,137,26740
26740,6,10,Lily ,Best friend alert!,138,26741
26741,6,10,Ted ,"Okay, the Turturkeykey is officially cooking.",139,26742
26742,6,10,Marshall ,"Oh, God, that is disgusting!",140,26743
26743,6,10,Ted ,"Okay, guys, that's starting to hurt.",141,26744
26744,6,10,Marshall ,"No... no, Ted. Random number guy just sent me his wang back.",142,26745
26745,6,10,Robin ,"Wow. You sent a wang out, and you got a wang back.",143,26746
26746,6,10,Lily ,It's a boom-a-wang.,144,26747
26747,6,10,Robin ,Nice.,145,26748
26748,6,10,Lily ,Thank you.,146,26749
26749,6,10,Robin ,"No, I meant the wang.",147,26750
26750,6,10,Zoey ,"Barney, could you get me some more ice?",148,26751
26751,6,10,Barney ,Sure. But... no one move while I'm gone. (whispering): I'm scared.,149,26752
26752,6,10,Steve ,You're safe. It's okay to leave the room. You have to actually leave the building for something cool to happen.,150,26753
26753,6,10,Barney ,Thanks. You're the only one who's nice to me about this.,151,26754
26754,6,10,Steve ,"Okay, I got to test this.",152,26755
26755,6,10,Barney ,What happened?,153,26756
26756,6,10,Lily ,You missed it!,154,26757
26757,6,10,Marshall ,"Dude, you walked out of the room, the laws of physics stopped and the laws of awesome tripled.",155,26758
26758,6,10,Barney ,"Aw, man! You said I could leave the room!",156,26759
26759,6,10,Steve ,I just wanted to see something cool happen. I'm sorry. But I was on that island for what seems like eternity. I'm going to enjoy things on the other side.,157,26760
26760,6,10,Barney ,"No! Y-You... Robin, Robin. I will pay you to be The Blitz. $100! No-- $10,000. No-- 60 bucks. That's a lot of money for someone like you.",158,26761
26761,6,10,Marshall ,"Dude, The Blitz isn't something that can be bought or sold.",159,26762
26762,6,10,Zoey ,"Yeah, it's not like Ted's integrity.",160,26763
26763,6,10,Ted ,"Oh, what was that? I was distracted by the four-caret diamond your 53-year-old husband bought you.",161,26764
26764,6,10,Steve ,Facial!,162,26765
26765,6,10,Ted ,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a turturkeykey to baste.",163,26766
26766,6,10,Zoey ,I'm coming with you.,164,26767
26767,6,10,Ted ,No... I baste alone.,165,26768
26768,6,10,Zoey ,"Oh, I'm sure you're a master baster, Ted.",166,26769
26769,6,10,Steve ,Word play. Loving it.,167,26770
26770,6,10,Zoey ,But relax. I've got a ton of sides to heat up since my plans fell through.,168,26771
26771,6,10,Ted ,Who canceled? Your coven?,169,26772
26772,6,10,Steve ,Coven. Group of witches.,170,26773
26773,6,10,Zoey ,Yeah. They were worn out from putting that spell on your hair.,171,26774
26774,6,10,Steve ,Oh! Serve returned.,172,26775
26775,6,10,Ted ,Are you happy? You're ruining Thanksgiving.,173,26776
26776,6,10,Zoey ,"Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.",174,26777
26777,6,10,Steve ,"God, I'm so happy to be here. My face hurts from smiling.",175,26778
26778,6,10,Ted ,"Oh... I'm sorry, Lily. I'm just never going to like that woman.",176,26779
26779,6,10,Lily ,"Ted, give her a chance.",177,26780
26780,6,10,Ted ,Enemies can't become friends.,178,26781
26781,6,10,Zoey ,"Yes, they can. Right, guys?",179,26782
26782,6,10,Ted ,"No, no, no. You guys can't be objective. You still feel guilty about last night.",180,26783
26783,6,10,Robin ,"Well, let's get an outside opinion.",181,26784
26784,6,10,Ted ,Who are we gonna...,182,26785
26785,6,10,Robin ,"""Dear Wang Guy...Can enemies ever be friends? Just wondering.""",183,26786
26786,6,10,Ted ,Really? Wang Guy? We're asking Wang Guy?,184,26787
26787,6,10,Robin ,"He's bold and uninhibited, so why not? And guys, you know what? For fun, why don't we ask him what he does for a living? Wouldn't that be fun? Just ask...",185,26788
26788,6,10,Lily ,"Aww. You've got a little crush on Wang Guy, don't you?",186,26789
26789,6,10,Robin ,What? No. Shut up. I hate him.,187,26790
26790,6,10,Marshall ,"Oh, look. We got an answer. Here it is. ""Yes, enemies can become friends. ""Remember what Gandhi said. 'Be the change you want to see in the world.'""",188,26791
26791,6,10,Steve ,"Uh, did Wang Guy just quote Gandhi?",189,26792
26792,6,10,,"Barney, laughing: That is amazing. And I was here for it. Now Zoey is The Blitz. Ha, ha! (weak laugh) Burn on her.",190,26793
26793,6,10,Steve ,"Come on, man. Don't be that Blitz.",191,26794
26794,6,10,Barney ,I'm not any Blitz! You're The Blitz! You're all The Blitz! I slept with that cute Indian girl who cuts my hair!,192,26795
26795,6,10,Robin ,What does that have to do with anything?,193,26796
26796,6,10,Barney ,Nothing! I just forgot to brag about it before!,194,26797
26797,6,10,Ted ,"Guys, despite the wit and wisdom of Wang Guy, Zoey and I are never going to be friends. We're just here for her oven and that's it.",195,26798
26798,6,10,Ted ,"Oh, my God!",196,26799
26799,6,10,Zoey ,Did you do that on purpose?,197,26800
26800,6,10,Ted ,What? No. It was an accident.,198,26801
26801,6,10,Zoey ,"Oh, yeah. Well, like this is.",199,26802
26802,6,10,Ted ,"Oh, great. Real mature.",200,26803
26803,6,10,Zoey ,"Yeah, well, you started it.",201,26804
26804,6,10,Lily ,"Just stop it! God, can't you two just stop fighting for one day? Like, when the Roadrunner and the Coyote clocked out and had a beer together? Or-Or-Or Tom and Jerry shared a cup of coffee.",202,26805
26805,6,10,Ted ,"Lily, those are cartoon characters, and I'm pretty sure you're making up episodes. And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!",203,26806
26806,6,10,Zoey ,"Oh, get out. All of you, out!",204,26807
26807,6,10,Lily ,But it's Thanksgiving.,205,26808
26808,6,10,Steve ,And I'm a part of it.,206,26809
26809,6,10,Zoey ,Out!,207,26810
26810,6,10,Marshall ,Wait... Where's Barney?,208,26811
26811,6,10,Barney ,"Hey, guys, the most amazing thing just happened to me in that other roo... Aw, man.",209,26812
26812,6,10,Lily ,I don't get it. Why'd she just kick us out like that?,210,26813
26813,6,10,,Ted from 2030: And then the cab driver said the last thing any of us wanted to hear.,211,26814
26814,6,10,Driver ,Where to?,212,26815
26815,6,10,Ted ,I guess we're going home.,213,26816
26816,6,10,Driver ,Yeah. I don't know where that is.,214,26817
26817,6,10,Ted ,"Lily, where'd you get that?",215,26818
26818,6,10,Lily ,"Oh. When Zoey booted us, it made me want to steal something of hers again. Apartment full of designer labels, and what do I grab? ""Happy Turkey Day, Hannah. Love, Zoey."" I wonder who Hannah is.",216,26819
26819,6,10,Zoey ,"Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone, anyway. Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.",217,26820
26820,6,10,Ted ,"And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!",218,26821
26821,6,10,Zoey ,"Get out! All of you, out!",219,26822
26822,6,10,Ted ,We have to go back to Zoey's.,220,26823
26823,6,10,Driver ,"You gotta throw me some addresses, buddy.",221,26824
26824,6,10,Zoey ,"Oh, God. What are you doing here?",222,26825
26825,6,10,Ted ,Barney let us in.,223,26826
26826,6,10,Zoey ,Barney was here? I was walking around half-naked.,224,26827
26827,6,10,Barney ,"Aw, man! Wait. Which half?",225,26828
26828,6,10,Ted ,"Look, I'm sorry your stepdaughter didn't want to spend Thanksgiving with you.",226,26829
26829,6,10,Zoey ,How do you know that?,227,26830
26830,6,10,Ted ,I just do. It must be tough.,228,26831
26831,6,10,Zoey ,"It was the first Thanksgiving Hannah agreed to spend with me, and then at the last minute she changed her mind. She hates my guts.",229,26832
26832,6,10,Ted ,"I get that. Uh, you should hang on to this. You can give it to her next year.",230,26833
26833,6,10,Zoey ,Yeah... Right. Next year.,231,26834
26834,6,10,Ted ,"Hey, you never know. People don't stay enemies forever.",232,26835
26835,6,10,,Ted from 2030: And that's the story of how Zoey and I became friends.,233,26836
26836,6,10,Everyone ,Cheers.,234,26837
26837,6,10,Zoey ,"Before we eat, we should take a group picture and send it to Wang Guy.",235,26838
26838,6,10,Marshall ,"Ooh. Oh. Great idea. All right. Okay. Here we go. One, two, three.",236,26839
26839,6,10,Zoey ,"Ted, that is the best-looking turturkeykey I have ever seen.",237,26840
26840,6,10,Ted ,Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes as good as it looks.,238,26841
26841,6,10,,Ted from 2030: It didn't. It tasted wrong.,239,26842
26842,6,10,Steve ,Oops. We forgot to light the candles.,240,26843
26843,6,10,,"Ted from 2030: And just as Barney looked away, it happened.",241,26844
26844,6,10,Everyone ,The Gentleman!,242,26845
26845,6,10,Barney ,What happened? I saw it!,243,26846
26846,6,10,Steve ,"Aw, come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad. Aw, man. Oh, go ahead. I forgot my jacket.",244,26847
26847,6,10,Woman ,"Oh, hold the door!",245,26848
26848,6,10,Barney ,"Thank you, God!",246,26849
26849,6,10,Mysterious voice, Blitz.,247,26850
26850,6,11,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, in the winter of 2010, we had a new addition to our little group... Zoey. Zoey was married to... The Captain.",1,26851
26851,6,11,Captain ,"Boys! Great to see you! Looking smart. Have a wonderful time tonight, okay?",2,26852
26852,6,11,Marshall ,Okay. That man is terrifying.,3,26853
26853,6,11,Barney ,"Everything he said was nice, but I am profoundly scared.",4,26854
26854,6,11,Ted ,Keep smiling. He can still see us.,5,26855
26855,6,11,,Ted from 2030: There was just something about him. We couldn't put our finger on it until...,6,26856
26856,6,11,Marshall ,I figured it out! I know what's so creepy about The Captain.,7,26857
26857,6,11,Robin ,Okay.,8,26858
26858,6,11,Marshall ,"Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey.Observe. The bottom half of his face... is smiling. He seems happy. Seems like a nice guy. (everyone is murmuring happily) But the top half of his face...wants to m*rder you! Cheerful. Wants to m*rder you. No. Cheerful. Wants to m*rder you. Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question. Captain, what do you think of ice cream? Oh, he loves it!",9,26859
26859,6,11,Barney ,"Captain, what do you think of rainy days?",10,26860
26860,6,11,Marshall ,"Whoa, he hates them.",11,26861
26861,6,11,Robin ,"Captain, quick question: How do you feel about the Jonas Brothers? Ooh.",12,26862
26862,6,11,Ted ,Ooh. What-What is that?,13,26863
26863,6,11,Robin and Lily, I don't get it.,14,26864
26864,6,11,Marshall ,He hates that he loves them.,15,26865
26865,6,11,Ted ,"Great. Okay. Hey, guys, Zoey just told me about this great Frank Lloyd Wright retrospective tonight. Who's in?",16,26866
26866,6,11,Lily ,"Sorry, I'm, uh, I... I- I don't know, washing my hair.",17,26867
26867,6,11,Marshall ,Running the water.,18,26868
26868,6,11,Robin ,Holding the towel.,19,26869
26869,6,11,Barney ,And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited meto the big hair washing party.,20,26870
26870,6,11,Ted ,"All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.",21,26871
26871,6,11,Lily ,"Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one...",22,26872
26872,6,11,Barney ,Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude.,23,26873
26873,6,11,Lily ,Rule number one: don't go anywhere that has candles.,24,26874
26874,6,11,Marshall ,"Excuse me, Captain, how do you feel about Ted and Zoey having an intimate chat by candlelight? It'll be the last dinner they ever have.",25,26875
26875,6,11,Lily ,"Rule number two: No sharing food. In fact, anything involving saliva is off-limits. Toothbrushes, thermometers, lipstick.",26,26876
26876,6,11,Ted ,"Well, if I can't share her lipstick,there's really no pointin even going.",27,26877
26877,6,11,Lily ,And the most important rule of all...,28,26878
26878,6,11,Barney ,Lubricant is public property. (Robin groans),29,26879
26879,6,11,Marshall ,Please.,30,26880
26880,6,11,Lily ,No lying to the spouse about anything you do.,31,26881
26881,6,11,Ted ,"Why would anyone lie? Look, Zoey and I are just friends. If there was anything more than that, I wouldn't hang out with her.",32,26882
26882,6,11,Marshall ,"Lily's right, Ted. Once you're married, it's very hard to be friends with a single person of the opposite s*x.",33,26883
26883,6,11,Robin ,"Yeah. Unless you're old friends, which is why I can hang out with Marshall whenever I want. Right, Marsh Madness?",34,26884
26884,6,11,Marshall ,"No doubt, Robo Cop.",35,26885
26885,6,11,Lily ,You two never hang out alone. You just made up those nicknames right now.,36,26886
26886,6,11,Marshall ,I guess it's true. You and I never really hang out alone.,37,26887
26887,6,11,Robin ,"Well, let's. Let's have dinner together, just the two of us.",38,26888
26888,6,11,Lily ,Oh! Sweet. No candles.,39,26889
26889,6,11,Barney ,"Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. Want to hang?",40,26890
26890,6,11,,Ted from 2030: And then Lily said something to Barney that insulted every fiber of his being.,41,26891
26891,6,11,Lily ,Nah.,42,26892
26892,6,11,,"Ted from 2030: Wait. No. It had to be more than just, ""Nah."" Oh, I think she said...",43,26893
26893,6,11,Lily ,You're a big... stupid octopus head!,44,26894
26894,6,11,,"Ted from 2030: No, that doesn't make sense. Okay, hang on. What did she say? She said, um, uh... To be honest kids, I'm having a little trouble remembering exactly what their fight was about. Hey, it was 20 years ago! I'll remember. Anyway, the next night...",45,26895
26895,6,11,Ted ,"Well, Lily, you were right. Something weird happened with Zoey last night.",46,26896
26896,6,11,Zoey ,"Oh, that's the Captain. Yes, I call my husband The Captain, but that is the only concession I make to his seafaring ways. Hang on. Ahoy. I'm just out with friends.",47,26897
26897,6,11,Ted ,Friends. Plural. Like-Like there was more than one of me.,48,26898
26898,6,11,Lily ,"Ew! Ew! She lied to her husband? Uh-oh. So, what did you do?",49,26899
26899,6,11,Ted ,"Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say you were out with friends?",50,26900
26900,6,11,Zoey ,"Yeah. The Captain's on his way home from Milan. He can get a little jealous sometimes, so I didn't want to make him worry. Is that okay?",51,26901
26901,6,11,Ted ,It's totally okay.,52,26902
26902,6,11,Lily ,"It's not okay! I didn't really think it was okay! Pur-leez! You lie to your husband all the time. ""Uh, uh, that shirt looks great on you""""I love your mom""""I never fantasize about Barney when we're doing it"""" Sound familiar, Pinocchio?",53,26903
26903,6,11,Marshall ,What's wrong with this shirt?,54,26904
26904,6,11,Ted ,"Lily, ruling. Do I have to stop hanging out with Zoey?",55,26905
26905,6,11,Lily ,"No, you just need to spend time with her and The Captain together. If you're friends with the both of them, then there's not a problem.",56,26906
26906,6,11,Ted ,"Actually, I do have a standing invitation from The Captain to go for a ride with them on his boat.",57,26907
26907,6,11,Lily ,"Great. So go make nice with Captain Creepy, and problem solved.",58,26908
26908,6,11,,"Ted from 2030: The next night, Marshall and Robin went to dinner, just the two of them. Now historically, they had three solid conversation topics: cold weather...",59,26909
26909,6,11,Robin ,December chill... so great.,60,26910
26910,6,11,Marshall ,Totally.,61,26911
26911,6,11,,Ted from 2030:...sports...,62,26912
26912,6,11,Marshall ,Did you catch the game last night?,63,26913
26913,6,11,Robin ,Yeah. Nail-biter.,64,26914
26914,6,11,,Ted from 2030:...and cold weather sports.,65,26915
26915,6,11,Marshall ,You know what's fun? Is cold weather sports.,66,26916
26916,6,11,Robin ,They are fun.,67,26917
26917,6,11,,Ted from 2030: They blew through them all in the first 16 seconds.,68,26918
26918,6,11,Robin ,"Man, this is awkward.",69,26919
26919,6,11,Marshall ,"She's giving me nothing! He's just staring at me! She's just staring at me! It's making me nervous. Great, now my left eye is twitching.",70,26920
26920,6,11,Robin ,"Marshall, it's cool. She doesn't see it. What the hell's going on with his eye? Am I supposed to not talk about that? Great, now my right eye is doing it.",71,26921
26921,6,11,Waiter ,Can I get you two some drinks?,72,26922
26922,6,11,Marshall ,Lots of drinks.,73,26923

26929,6,11,Lily ,Watch out!,80,26930
26930,6,11,,Ted from 2030: Wait. They were on the street.,81,26931

26935,6,11,Lily ,Wait. I still can't resist getting one last shot in.,86,26936
26936,6,11,,"Ted from 2030: Like I said, the fight was just getting started.",87,26937
26937,6,11,Ted ,"Hi, Captain. The Captain. Captain.",88,26938
26938,6,11,Captain ,"Ahoy, Ted! Excellent to see you.",89,26939
26939,6,11,Ted ,"Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey?",90,26940
26940,6,11,Captain ,"Well, I'm afraid she's feeling a little under the weather. Looks like it's just you, me and six hours in frigid international waters.",91,26941
26941,6,11,Ted ,"Or we could stay on dry land, hang out with some... witnesses.",92,26942
26942,6,11,Captain ,"You're a hoot. I've been looking forward to this. For a very long time. Well, anchors aweigh!",93,26943
26943,6,11,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, here's one thing I do remember. I was pretty sure I was going to die that night.",94,26944
26944,6,11,Robin ,"You know, I had this really boring poetry class in college.",95,26945
26945,6,11,Marshall ,You were just thinking that this dinner is really boring. That's what made you think of your boring class in college.,96,26946
26946,6,11,Robin ,"What?! What? No! No! No, no, no. Marshall, no. No. I... I just saw that board of specials, and I thought, you know what sucks? Being bored. Which I am not. So that clears that... right up.",97,26947
26947,6,11,Marshall ,"Robin, I'm an attorney.",98,26948
26948,6,11,Robin ,Fine. This night's a little awkward.,99,26949
26949,6,11,Marshall ,I guess it's 'cause we never hang out alone together.,100,26950
26950,6,11,Robin ,Why is that?,101,26951
26951,6,11,Marshall ,It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory.,102,26952
26952,6,11,Marshall ,"Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB.",103,26953
26953,6,11,Barney ,"So, who's the eye broccoli?",104,26954
26954,6,11,Marshall ,"Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good.",105,26955
26955,6,11,Barney ,"Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs.",106,26956
26956,6,11,Marshall ,I don't think that's gonna be a problem.,107,26957
26957,6,11,Barney ,"Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be?",108,26958
26958,6,11,Marshall ,I'm sorry. Myth?,109,26959
26959,6,11,Barney ,"It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like... beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now.",110,26960
26960,6,11,Marshall ,"And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually...",111,26961
26961,6,11,Barney ,D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks.,112,26962
26962,6,11,Marshall ,Did we bet on this?,113,26963
26963,6,11,Barney ,Let's say yes.,114,26964
26964,6,11,Robin ,And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes.,115,26965
26965,6,11,Marshall ,"As Lily's best friend, you are the last person on the planet o's allowed to turn into a mermaid.",116,26966
26966,6,11,Robin ,"Wait, does that mean that I'm a manatee right now?",117,26967
26967,6,11,Marshall ,Big-time manatee.,118,26968
26968,6,11,Robin ,What were those sailors thinking?,119,26969
26969,6,11,Marshall ,Huh. I don't know. Being out at sea can do crazy things to a man.,120,26970
26970,6,11,Captain ,"Vast, the sea. Deep. Endless. Going around for miles. You could scream and scream, and not a soul would hear you. Listen to this. (screams) Help! Somebody help me! I'm trapped on a boat with a madman! Help! See? Nothing.",121,26971
26971,6,11,Ted ,"He's gonna k*ll me. Okay, calm down, Teddy. He's not jealous. He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.",122,26972
26972,6,11,Captain ,"So, Ted, I noticed you've been spending a lot of time with Zoey.",123,26973
26973,6,11,,"Ted from 2030: Okay, back to Barney and Lily and whatever the hell they were fighting about.",124,26974
26974,6,11,Lily ,"Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there.",125,26975
26975,6,11,Barney ,"What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face!",126,26976
26976,6,11,,"Ted from 2030: Wait. Barney's not a woman. That's right... Barney wasn't hurt by Lily, Lily was hurt by Barney.",127,26977
26977,6,11,Lily ,Want to hang?,128,26978
26978,6,11,Barney ,Nah. Watch out!,129,26979
26979,6,11,Lily ,"Wow... thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us.",130,26980
26980,6,11,Lily ,"If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!",131,26981
26981,6,11,,"Ted from 2030: Okay, now I'm on track. The rest of this story should make perfect sense.",132,26982
26982,6,11,Barney ,"Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",133,26983
26983,6,11,Lily ,You're a jerk.,134,26984
26984,6,11,,"Ted from 2030: Okay, that makes no sense. Kids, I'm officially admitting defeat. I will never remember this story. I'm sorry for wasting your time.",135,26985
26985,6,11,Captain ,"Ted, let me show you my harpoon collection.",136,26986
26986,6,11,Ted ,"Just gonna make a quick call. Hey, silly question. What are our exact nautical coordinates?",137,26987
26987,6,11,Captain ,"How now? Oh, bother. (sighs) Well... she's a goner. By now, the icy tide has already dropped its core temperature to near freezing. And down it goes. Now it's at 50 meters. Complete crushing blackness. 100 meters. The pressure is so intense, the keys are popping right out of its head.",138,26988
26988,6,11,Ted ,Head?,139,26989
26989,6,11,Captain ,"200 meters. No one will ever find its mangled remains, save for the crustacea that feed off its lifeless husk. Can you hear me now? No. Because you're on the bottom of the sea.",140,26990
26990,6,11,Ted ,"Well, I got a big morning, so... Dry cleaners, bank, you know, so...",141,26991
26991,6,11,Captain ,"Ted, it's time. I have something for you. Wait here.",142,26992
26992,6,11,,"Ted:: Okay, you got to swim for it, Mosby. Man versus sea. You can do this. You didn't get a ""Good Effort"" ribbon from the Shaker Heights JCC Swim Camp because you don't have what it takes.",143,26993
26993,6,11,Captain ,Found it. Zoey told me you're a scotch drinker. I bought this special for tonight.,144,26994
26994,6,11,,"Ted from 2030:And just as I started to realize that maybe I wasn't in danger after all, we hit a bump.",145,26995
26995,6,11,Captain ,Ted?,146,26996
26996,6,11,Robin ,"you're afraid that if you spend too much time alone with me, I'll turn into a mermaid?",147,26997
26997,6,11,Marshall ,"Yes. I mean, sure, right now, you're bald and leathery ancovered in a thick layer of blubber...",148,26998
26998,6,11,Robin ,Am I blushing or...?,149,26999
26999,6,11,,"Marshall:...but at some point, my stupid male brain will transform you into a foxy fish-babe singin' ""Part of Your World"" to my pants.",150,27000
27000,6,11,Robin ,"Okay, even if that happens, is there any way to un-mermaid me?",151,27001
27001,6,11,Marshall ,I asked Barney the same thing.,152,27002
27002,6,11,Barney ,"Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome.",153,27003
27003,6,11,Marshall ,Death?,154,27004
27004,6,11,Barney ,"Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City... where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty.",155,27005
27005,6,11,Robin ,Pregnancy?,156,27006
27006,6,11,Marshall ,"Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant, she becomes a manatee again. Never thought I'd say that sentence.",157,27007
27007,6,11,,"Ted from 2030: Wait! That's it! That's what Barney and Lily were fighting about! The Mermaid Theory! But their argument didn't happen at the same time as all this other stuff. I'm literally in the wrong year! It happened much, much later when Lily was... pregnant.",158,27008
27008,6,11,Barney ,"Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang?",159,27009
27009,6,11,Liy ,"Nah. Whenever we're alone, you spend the whole time undressing me with your eyes. You even take off my shoes.",160,27010
27010,6,11,Barney ,"High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee.",161,27011
27011,6,11,Lily ,"Well, you're a big... stupid octopus face!",162,27012
27012,6,11,,Ted from 2030: That was it! I remember now!,163,27013
27013,6,11,Lily ,"Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman ""fat"" right to her face!",164,27014
27014,6,11,Barney ,"I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",165,27015
27015,6,11,Lily ,Oh... You're a jerk.,166,27016
27016,6,11,Barney ,"Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act.",167,27017
27017,6,11,,Lily:What's that?,168,27018
27018,6,11,Barney ,Breast-feeding. Hot.,169,27019
27019,6,11,Lily ,Really?,170,27020
27020,6,11,Barney ,Really. When those things swell up to three times their normal size... so do I.,171,27021
27021,6,11,Lily ,That's so sweet!,172,27022
27022,6,11,,Ted from 2030: See kids? Told you I'd get it!,173,27023
27023,6,11,Ted ,"Okay, now we're even!",174,27024
27024,6,11,,"Ted from 2030: Yeah, that's the ending to a whole other story. We'll get there.",175,27025
27025,6,11,Captain ,So you really thought I was gonna k*ll you?,176,27026
27026,6,11,Ted ,Well... ish.,177,27027
27027,6,11,Captain ,"Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous. If I wanted to k*ll you, I'd invite you to my hunting lodge. It's far more remote, and I wouldn't have to worry about you turning up in some nosy fisherman's net.",178,27028
27028,6,11,Ted ,See? It's stuff like that. Why-why do you talk that way?,179,27029
27029,6,11,Captain ,"Oh, I'm just jesting for sport. See, sometimes I don't bond as well with Zoey's younger friends. But I know she really likes you. I was hoping that maybe we could be buddies.",180,27030
27030,6,11,Ted ,We can. We can be buddies. Just not on a boat.,181,27031
27031,6,11,Captain ,Fair enough. The hunting lodge it is.,182,27032
27032,6,11,,"Robin, slurring: You know, once we stopped trying to have a conversation and just focused on the drinking... I had fun.",183,27033
27033,6,11,Marshall ,"Yeah, me, too.",184,27034
27034,6,11,,Ted from 2030: And then a terrible thing happened. Marshall's beer goggles kicked in and his very drunk mind started to see...,185,27035
27035,6,11,Marshall ,"No... No, no! No! No, don't turn!",186,27036
27036,6,11,Robin ,"Uh-oh. I don't feel so good. (She vomits) Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry! Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting.",187,27037
27037,6,11,Marshall ,I really do.,188,27038
27038,6,11,,"Ted from 2030: And from that moment on Marshall never worried about Robin becoming a mermaid again, and the two of them were closer than ever.",189,27039
27039,6,11,Zoey ,"Hey, Ted.",190,27040
27040,6,11,Ted ,Hey. You feeling better?,191,27041
27041,6,11,Zoey ,I have a confession to make. I wasn't really sick.,192,27042
27042,6,11,Ted ,You weren't?,193,27043
27043,6,11,Zoey ,"I'm sorry. I was just feeling guilty that I lied to The Captain and... I don't know, I just thought it would be good if you two spent some time together.",194,27044
27044,6,11,Ted ,"I get it. And you were right. He's a nice guy. I mean, he can be a little scary.",195,27045
27045,6,11,Zoey ,"Yeah, he gets a little murder-y when he's nervous.",196,27046
27046,6,11,Ted ,"Yeah, he's a creepy dude. But I like him. And I just want to make sure you and I hanging out doesn't, you know, cross any lines.",197,27047
27047,6,11,Zoey ,"Me, too.",198,27048
27048,6,11,Ted ,"I mean, if either one of us had even the slightest hint of feelings for the other, we shouldn't hang out. You don't, do you?",199,27049
27049,6,11,Zoey ,No. Do you?,200,27050

27269,6,12,Robin ,"Hey, Ted, if I, um, if I ever get married and you're not the guy I'm marrying...",216,27270
27270,6,12,Ted ,"Big mistake, but go on.",217,27271
27271,6,12,,"Robin:...I could really use someone like you. You know, in case I freak out. When I freak out. You interested?",218,27272
27272,6,12,Ted ,Are you asking what I think you're asking?,219,27273
27273,6,12,Robin ,"Ted, will you be my best man?",220,27274
27274,6,12,Ted ,Scherbatsky... I'm gonna crush it.,221,27275
27275,6,12,Barney ,"Hi, there. We've had a lot of fun tonight, but on a more serious note, this is the time of year when we remember the importance of giving. And there's no greater gift than the gift of booty. So, this holiday season, why not bang someone in need? I'm Barney Stinson, and that's... One to grow on.",222,27276
27276,6,12,Woman ,"Um, no.",223,27277
27277,6,12,Barney ,"Hi, there. You know, we've had a lot of fun tonight...",224,27278
27278,6,13,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when Lily and Marshall started trying to have a baby, they went a little crazy.",1,27279
27279,6,13,Lily ,"We've been trying and trying, and still nothing's happened. I'm just worried we can't have children.",2,27280
27280,6,13,Doctor ,And how long have you been trying?,3,27281
27281,6,13,Lily ,Six days.,4,27282
27282,6,13,,"Ted from 2030: But then, months went by, and still nothing happened.",5,27283
27283,6,13,Lily ,Something must be wrong. W... we're doing it a lot.,6,27284
27284,6,13,Marshall ,"And everywhere... the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, outside in your wait... the kitchen.",7,27285
27285,6,13,Lily ,"Seriously, Doc, why isn't this happening?",8,27286
27286,6,13,Doctor ,"Look, if you're really worried, here is a number for a reproductive endocrinologist... Dr. Stangel. He's the best in the city.",9,27287
27287,6,13,Marshall ,"Dr. John Stangel? I don't know, baby, do we really need a specialist?",10,27288
27288,6,13,Lily ,"Well, what's your plan, Marshall, just have unprotected s*x day after day after day in every position imaginable until...? Wait, it sounded worse in my head.",11,27289
27289,6,13,Barney ,"Guys, we've got a problem. This is the application for the regional doubles laser tag tournament in Poughkeepsie. Problem is, only one of you can be my partner. So it looks like we've got a bake-off. You may now present your arguments.",12,27290
27290,6,13,Marshall ,I'm not playing laser tag.,13,27291
27291,6,13,Ted ,I'm absolutely not playing laser tag.,14,27292
27292,6,13,Marshall ,Damn it.,15,27293
27293,6,13,Barney ,And Marshall's the winner.,16,27294
27294,6,13,Lily ,"Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Stangel. It can't hurt.",17,27295
27295,6,13,,"Ted from 2030: So Aunt Lily went to see Dr. John Stangel, the man who knew more about human reproduction than anyone in New York City.",18,27296
27296,6,13,Stangel ,So I understand you want to get pregnant.,19,27297
27297,6,13,Barney ,"Yeah, and it cuts in and out.",20,27298
27298,6,13,Lily ,Ooh! How did you do it?,21,27299
27299,6,13,Barney ,"Oh, God, you found one of the cameras. I swear that's the only one. Wait, which one did you find?",22,27300
27300,6,13,Lily ,What are you talking about?,23,27301
27301,6,13,Barney ,What are you talking about?,24,27302
27302,6,13,Lily ,My visit to a certain Dr. Stangel.,25,27303
27303,6,13,Strangel ,"We'll look at all the factors that contribute to fertility: dietary, environmental, genetic. But first, Ms. Aldrin, do you have any questions for me?",26,27304
27304,6,13,Lily ,"Just one, ""Dr. Stangel"". Where'd you get the beard?",27,27305
27305,6,13,Strangel ,"Well, m... my mother's Armenian.",28,27306
27306,6,13,Marshall ,"Lily, I've been with Barney since 9:00 a.m. Between the sexual harassment seminar all morning and the secretary beauty pageant all afternoon, he hasn't left my sight.",29,27307
27307,6,13,Lily ,"Wait, so you weren't wearing a fake beard and examining girl parts all day?",30,27308
27308,6,13,Barney ,Not today I wasn't.,31,27309
27309,6,13,Ted ,"Wow, we finally found Barney's doppelganger. I guess we can tell you now, Lily. That hot dog guy did not look like Barney.",32,27310
27310,6,13,Lily ,"Uh, Marshall?",33,27311
27311,6,13,Marshall ,"Yes, I know, we made our little deal with the universe, but...",34,27312
27312,6,13,Lily ,"No, we've made a binding covenant with the universe. We said we weren't going to try to have kids until we saw Barney's doppelganger. Oh, this is bad news. This is like a black cat walked through my uterus. Okay, that's it. I am going back to Dr. Stangel and getting thoroughly checked out.",35,27313
27313,6,13,Barney ,Or... or cost-saving alternative: you could get checked out by someone who looks just like him. I'm gonna go scrub up. I'll meet you in stall three.,36,27314
27314,6,13,Lily ,I still kind of think it's Barney.,37,27315
27315,6,13,Marshall ,There's no way it's Barney.,38,27316
27316,6,13,Stangel ,"Hello, you must be Mr. Eriksen. I am Dr. Stangel.",39,27317
27317,6,13,Marshall ,"It's Barney. Wow. Really, dude, bravo. You almost got a peek. But seriously, what second-rate community theater did you get...?",40,27318
27318,6,13,Stangel ,Would you...? I...,41,27319
27319,6,13,Marshall ,So my wife and I are trying to get pregnant.,42,27320
27320,6,13,Stangel ,"All right, Ms. Aldrin, please just put your feet up in the stirrups. We can begin.",43,27321
27321,6,13,Lily ,"Uh-uh, no. Can't do it.",44,27322
27322,6,13,Marshall ,"No, but, baby, I yanked on his beard.",45,27323
27323,6,13,Stangel ,He checks out. I really don't have time for this.,46,27324
27324,6,13,Marshall ,"No, Barney... Doctor, wait, please, it's... Can you just give us a couple minutes? I... Lily, how can I convince you that this is not Barney?",47,27325
27325,6,13,Barney ,"Wow, it is like looking into a poorly dressed mirror.",48,27326
27326,6,13,Stangel ,"Okay, you have to go. Leave the model of the v*g1n*.",49,27327
27327,6,13,Lily ,Okay. Convinced.,50,27328
27328,6,13,Stangel ,"Great. All right, you're a little low on the table. Please scoot up.",51,27329
27329,6,13,Lily ,"""Suit up""... not convinced. This whole thing stinks to high heaven.",52,27330
27330,6,13,Marshall ,"Baby, you just saw Barney.",53,27331
27331,6,13,Lily ,He could have pulled some crazy switch. Remember when his Swedish cousin came to visit?,54,27332
27332,6,13,Marshall ,"Oh, yeah... Bjorney.",55,27333
27333,6,13,Lily ,"Yeah, I'm sorry, but unless I see Barney at the same time, I... I'll never be sure that Dr. Stangel isn't him.",56,27334
27334,6,13,Barney ,"How you doing, Lily?! Should I have a boner?!",57,27335
27335,6,13,Strangel ,"Okay, we're all done. I'll call you in a few days with the results.",58,27336
27336,6,13,Lily ,Thank you.,59,27337
27337,6,13,Barney ,"Hey, you don't mind if I take pictures, do you?!",60,27338
27338,6,13,Lily ,Can we leave him in here for a while?,61,27339
27339,6,13,Strangel ,I'm done for the day. You can leave him in here all night.,62,27340
27340,6,13,Barney ,"Aw, yeah. Smile for the birdie, Lil! Gyno-mite!",63,27341
27341,6,13,,"Ted from 2030: Now, while all this was going on, your Aunt Robin was starting her new job at World Wide News, aka the big leagues. She was excited. This job was a new start, a clean slate.",64,27342
27342,6,13,Ted ,"So, first day of work?",65,27343
27343,6,13,Woman ,"Everyone, say hello to your new research associate Robin Scherbatsky.",66,27344
27344,6,13,Robin ,"Hi, guys.",67,27345
27345,6,13,Woman ,"Oh, here comes our new Hardfire host. Robin, this is Sandy Rivers.",68,27346
27346,6,13,Ted ,Sandy Rivers?!,69,27347
27347,6,13,,Ted from 2030: Sandy Rivers... Robin's old co-host and my old nemesis.,70,27348
27348,6,13,Sandy ,We should have s*x.,71,27349
27349,6,13,Ted ,"Oh, I hate that guy.",72,27350
27350,6,13,Robin ,It gets worse.,73,27351
27351,6,13,Woman ,"Sandy, this is...",74,27352
27352,6,13,Sandy ,Robin.,75,27353
27353,6,13,Woman ,You two know each other?,76,27354
27354,6,13,Sandy ,Know each other? We've had s*x.,77,27355
27355,6,13,Ted ,You had s*x with Sandy Rivers?,78,27356
27356,6,13,Robin ,"No! Ugh! And I can't believe it's my first day, and already I'm the girl who slept with the host of the show.",79,27357
27357,6,13,Ted ,Already? Were you planning on eventually sleeping with the host?,80,27358
27358,6,13,Robin ,"Well, now that I know it's Sandy, I'm not.",81,27359
27359,6,13,Marshall ,"Hey, babe.",82,27360
27360,6,13,Lily ,"Hi, honey. There's a couple messages on the machine. Your dad called. He wants to know if you have any sixes.",83,27361
27361,6,13,Marshall ,"Yeah, uh, we got a game of ""Go Fish"" going on the phone. P.S., Pops, go fish. Who's the second message from?",84,27362
27362,6,13,Lily ,Dr. Stangel's office. I'm extremely fertile.,85,27363
27363,6,13,Marshall ,"You're extremely fertile! Oh, my God. I told you there was nothing to worry about. I got to call my dad and tell him the good news. If you're fertile, um, then that means I'm the problem.",86,27364
27364,6,13,Lily ,"Okay, now you're being ridiculous. An hour ago, you didn't even think there was a problem.",87,27365
27365,6,13,Marshall ,"Well, I was just putting on a brave face. Okay, think about it: we've had unprotected s*x 203 times in the past four months. Obviously I'm the problem.",88,27366
27366,6,13,Barney ,Problem?! You can't get a girl pregnant. That's the dream. I'd give my firstborn to not be able to have children.,89,27367
27367,6,13,Ted ,"So, second day of work?",90,27368
27368,6,13,Lily ,What's wrong?,91,27369
27369,6,13,Ted ,"Oh, you didn't hear? She's the office slut.",92,27370
27370,6,13,Lily ,"Already? Oh, honey.",93,27371
27371,6,13,Robin ,I wish I was the office slut.,94,27372
27372,6,13,Robin ,And we can explore how those policy changes will affect Iraq.,95,27373
27373,6,13,Sandy ,Yes. We definitely had s*x.,96,27374
27374,6,13,Robin ,We did not have s*x.,97,27375
27375,6,13,Sandy ,Then why do I remember you?,98,27376
27376,6,13,Robin ,"I don't know, maybe because I'm a smart, talented, professional.",99,27377
27377,6,13,Sandy ,"No, none of those. Oh, I remember. We didn't have s*x.",100,27378
27378,6,13,Robin ,Thank you.,101,27379
27379,6,13,Sandy ,You're the girl who did the report on the carriage driver and slipped and fell in horse poop...,102,27380
27380,6,13,Robin ,We did have s*x.,103,27381
27381,6,13,Sandy ,"Oh, I... I remember now. Gregory, do me a favor.",104,27382
27382,6,13,Robin ,But this reporter takes pride in...,105,27383
27383,6,13,Robin ,And now everyone calls me Scherpoopie. It's not funny.,106,27384
27384,6,13,Ted ,"Robin, a word of advice: play along. Okay, the more you fight it, the worse it's going to get. It's like when your car slides on ice, you steer into the skid.",107,27385
27385,6,13,Barney ,"Exactly! Or when your... I don't know... friend invites you to a laser tag tournament, you don't fight it. You just strap on the vinyl holster and race into that abandoned JCPenney g*ns a-blazin'. I'm just agreeing with Ted.",108,27386
27386,6,13,Marshall ,"Oh, it's my dad.",109,27387
27387,6,13,Ted ,Aren't you going to get it?,110,27388
27388,6,13,Marshall ,"No, no, you know what? Um, I'm gonna get my stuff checked out first. I'll call my dad after Dr. Stangel gives me the thumbs up.",111,27389
27389,6,13,Ted ,He has to do that?,112,27390
27390,6,13,Robin ,But I thought you talk to your dad about everything.,113,27391
27391,6,13,Marshall ,"I only like to call my dad with good news. I mean, telling him good news is what makes it feel real to me.",114,27392
27392,6,13,Marshall ,I'm getting married!,115,27393
27393,6,13,Marvin ,Yeah...!,116,27394

27397,6,13,Marvin ,That's what I'm talking about!,120,27398
27398,6,13,Marshall ,Right?! I found someone who can fix the Viking lamp!,121,27399
27399,6,13,Marshall ,"But the news that I might not be able to give him a grandchild? You know, like, I don't even know how to have that conversation.",122,27400
27400,6,13,Barney ,"I'll show you. ""Dad, there's, uh, there's something I need to tell you, and it's going to come as a bit of a shock to you, but here goes. You are speaking to the 2011 Tri-County Laser Tag Co-Champion"".",123,27401
27401,6,13,Marshall ,"Barney, I've already told...",124,27402
27402,6,13,Barney ,"""Oh, and my sperm don't work. Yeah, yeah, the laser tag thing is awesome"".",125,27403
27403,6,13,Ted ,"So, third day of work?",126,27404
27404,6,13,Robin ,"And the fertilizer is seeping into the ground water, causing...",127,27405
27405,6,13,Sandy ,Is Scherpoopie pitching a story about manure? Genius.,128,27406
27406,6,13,Robin ,"Okay, yes, I, uh, I fell into some manure. It's hilarious, fine. In a five-year career of on-air reports, there are bound to be a few embarrassing moments.",129,27407
27407,6,13,Sandy ,A few?,130,27408
27408,6,13,Robin ,"Uh, but in my case, it was just the one, and you found it, so, uh... Just the one.",131,27409
27409,6,13,Sandy ,Gregory.,132,27410
27410,6,13,Ted ,"Oh, God. What did they find?",133,27411

27415,6,13,Robin ,I did not get attacked by an owl.,138,27416
27416,6,13,Ted ,"Robin, listen, here's what you need to do...",139,27417
27417,6,13,Robin ,"Okay, don't you dare tell me to steer into the skid, okay? It's too late. I'm already wrapped around a hydro pole. It's a Canadian telephone pole. I never should have taken this job.",140,27418
27418,6,13,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, at that moment, I knew what I had to do for my friend Robin. But first I had to do something for me.",141,27419
27419,6,13,Ted ,"Show me ""owl attack"".",142,27420
27420,6,13,Marshall ,I am freaking out. Is there a chance that I can't have kids? I've been hit in the nuts a lot.,143,27421
27421,6,13,Stangel ,"Well, we won't know anything until we run some tests. We'll need a sample of your sperm. No, no, no. There's a room at the end of the hall. If you find yourself inside the elevator, you've gone too far. You'd think I wouldn't have to say that, but you'd be surprised.",144,27422

27425,6,13,,Man #4: I'm here every Thursday.,148,27426
27426,6,13,Marshall ,"I can't do it, Doc. Is there, like, another option? Could I... Could I take this home?",149,27427
27427,6,13,Stangel ,"Sure, you could, but, uh... we close in an hour and I'm not back till Tuesday. So, clock is ticking. Make it fast.",150,27428
27428,6,13,Marshall ,"Only way I know how, Doc. Only way I know how.",151,27429
27429,6,13,Marvin ,Surprise!,152,27430

27431,6,13,Marshall ,Mom. Dad. Uh... What are you doing here?,154,27432
27432,6,13,Judy ,We hadn't heard from you in a couple days. We were worried about you.,155,27433
27433,6,13,Marvin ,"For God's sake, son. Do you have any sixes?",156,27434
27434,6,13,Marshall ,"Go fish. Excuse me. Hey, Lily, can I just talk to you in here for a minute?",157,27435
27435,6,13,Lily ,"Oh, yeah. Isn't it great? They just showed up. Your mom's already rearranged my kitchen, organized my closet... and she asked me if I lost height. Not weight. Height.",158,27436
27436,6,13,Marshall ,"Yeah, I'm very excited that they're here, too. But right now, I have to get excited about something else.",159,27437

27445,6,13,Robin ,"Oh, God. Tell me you didn't go over there.",168,27446
27446,6,13,Ted ,I just thought he needed to listen to common sense and reasonable discourse.,169,27447

27448,6,13,Ted ,They're my feet. I'm actually more of a kicker. So I went to his apartment.,171,27449

27450,6,13,Robin ,"Oh, my God. This is...",173,27451

27652,6,14,Judy ,What possible excuse could you have for this?,152,27653
27653,6,14,Lily ,I'm from New York. We think getting minors drunk is funny.,153,27654
27654,6,14,Judy ,"There's nothing funny about getting minors drunk! You should be ashamed, Lily! Ashamed! Mmm! Oh, cripes, that's tasty. Mmm! Mmm!",154,27655
27655,6,14,Lily ,"That salad's the first food she's eaten in two days. Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise and jelly beans, but it counts.",155,27656
27656,6,14,Ted ,"Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Marshall laugh once.",156,27657
27657,6,14,Barney ,Yeah. Showing videos of guys getting hit in the nuts wasn't going to do anything. I'm just stupid.,157,27658
27658,6,14,Ted ,Stupid.,158,27659
27659,6,14,Barney ,What we need to do is hit each other in the nuts.,159,27660
27660,6,14,Ted ,Yes. Nothing beats the immediacy of live theater. But which one of us is going to take the hit?(Barney hits Ted in the nuts) So that's it? No discussion?,160,27661

27680,6,14,Barney ,She's right. Your dad was hilarious.,180,27681
27681,6,14,Marshall ,"You guys don't get it, okay? None of you do. My dad was my hero. And he was my teacher. And he was my best friend. He always came through for me. And now he's just gone. And what am I left with? (scratchy electronic sounds) Thanks a lot, God! Thank you! You took my father, the greatest man that I have ever known, and you ripped him off this Earth, way too young! And he'll never get to meet our kids, Lily. (scratchy sounds continue) But we got this voice mail. Thank you so much for the voice mail! It's a great comfort! 'Cause whenever I'm starting to feel lonely or sad, or-- or you know what, or maybe a little bit cheated, at least I got the sound of his pocket to console me. How is this fair? You know, like, an entire human life and it just ends for no reason, and... and what are we left with?",181,27682
27682,6,14,Marvin's voice," Marshall? Oh, looks like I've been calling you for almost five minutes. How's my pocket sound? (laughing) Oh, sorry about that, buddy. Um, anyway, your mom and I had such a great time seeing you. I love you.",182,27683

27801,6,15,Ted ,Then what am I supposed to do?,97,27802
27802,6,15,Robin ,"Okay, just shut it down. Okay, just ignore your feelings. If-If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self. Look, I like Zoey. Without her, my dinner party wouldn't have been such a success. So those feelings of yours... shut 'em down.",98,27803

27835,6,15,Zoey ,"Wait, she didn't go home with Ted?",131,27836
27836,6,15,Barney ,"Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize... (imitating squeaky bedsprings)",132,27837

But seeing Ted and Honey hit it off was more than her gentle heart could bear, so Zoey left early, pricked by love's fickle thorn. But then, the next morning, upon learning that Ted had not tasted of Honey's sweet nectar, her joy burst forth like a blossoming flower in spring.",136,27841
27841,6,15,Marshall ,Wow. Zoey's in love with Ted.,137,27842
27842,6,15,Marcus ,"Oh, Marshall, I stopped by that new doughnut shop Hertz Donuts. Would you like a Hertz Donut?",138,27843
27843,6,15,Marshall ,"Sure. Hey, where's the...? No! Aah!",139,27844
27844,6,15,Marcus ,"Hurts, don't it? I can't believe you fell for that, bro.",140,27845
27845,6,15,Marshall ,"So Ted's in love with Zoey and Zoey's in love with Ted? Well, that-that's not going to work. I got to call Ted.",141,27846
27846,6,15,Ted ,Hello.,142,27847
27847,6,15,Marshall ,"Listen, Ted, um, I got to tell you something about Zoey.",143,27848
27848,6,15,Ted ,"Yeah, yeah. I need to tell you something about Zoey, too.",144,27849
27849,6,15,Zoey ,Hey. I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd take you up on that beer you're about to offer me.,145,27850
27850,6,15,Ted ,Can I get you a beer?,146,27851
27851,6,15,Zoey ,"Oh, Ted, I'm so busy. But I guess I got time for one. Lead the way.",147,27852
27852,6,15,,"Ted, laughing: Oh, my God.",148,27853
27853,6,15,Zoey ,"What?! Fridge full of ketchup? How? How, I ask you? What?",149,27854
27854,6,15,,"Ted:Listen, Zoey, I, um... I need to tell you something. Um...",150,27855
27855,6,15,Judy ,"Marshall, I'm going to Byerly's. You want anything?",151,27856

27860,6,15,Ted ,"I, uh... I can't be friends with you anymore. And this may seem strange, but... you can't ask me why.",156,27861
27861,6,15,Zoey ,Wow. Okay.,157,27862
27862,6,15,Ted ,And that was it. No more Zoey.,158,27863
27863,6,15,Marshall ,"Oh. Hey, buddy, that's Lily. I should take that. But, uh, you're a good guy, Ted. Hey, baby.",159,27864
27864,6,15,Lily ,We hate Ted now. Get on board or the sexting stops.,160,27865
27865,6,15,Marshall ,"Ted's a son of a bitch! (cell phone chirps) Oh, nice. But, hey, um, baby, go easy on Ted, okay? He just, he just ended things with Zoey.",161,27866
27866,6,15,Lily ,"Oh, I know. But did he tell you the whole story?",162,27867
27867,6,15,Ted ,"I, uh, I can't be friends with you anymore. And you can't ask me why.",163,27868
27868,6,15,Zoey ,Why?,164,27869
27869,6,15,Ted ,Lily hates you.,165,27870
27870,6,15,Zoey ,You hate me?,166,27871
27871,6,15,Lily ,That's crazy. I don't hate you.,167,27872
27872,6,15,Zoey ,"Well, I know that's not true, Lily. Ted told me everything.",168,27873
27873,6,15,Lily ,"He... Oh, really? And-And what did Ted say, exactly?",169,27874
27874,6,15,Ted ,Lily hates you. She hates you so much it's hard to be around you. So we can't be friends.,170,27875
27875,6,15,Lily ,"Oh, he... Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay, well, I- I guess there's no use hiding it anymore. I- I hate you. Bitch.",171,27876
27876,6,15,Zoey ,I can't believe it. I really thought you and I were friends. Lord knows I could use a friend right now. I've been going through some pretty difficult stuff.,172,27877
27877,6,15,Marshall ,Difficult stuff? What difficult stuff?,173,27878
27878,6,15,Lily ,I don't know.,174,27879
27879,6,15,Marshall ,"Well, you did the right thing, baby.",175,27880
27880,6,15,Lily ,Not entirely.,176,27881
27881,6,15,Lily ,"Zoey, wait! I don't hate you! We just can't be friends anymore because... Robin hates you.",177,27882
27882,6,15,Marshall ,And that's Robin on the other line.,178,27883
27883,6,15,Lily ,"Oh, well, I'll let you take that. Love you, baby!",179,27884
27884,6,15,Marshall ,"Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking... Listen, Robin. I know. I apologize for my wife. She never should have...",180,27885
27885,6,15,Robin ,"Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her.",181,27886
27886,6,15,Marshall ,Me? You dragged me into this?!,182,27887
27887,6,15,Robin ,You just went through a tragedy. It's not like she's gonna call you up and...,183,27888
27888,6,15,Marshall ,"Oh, God, that's my other line. Oh, God, it's a 917 number, and I don't recognize it! I think it's Zoey!",184,27889
27889,6,15,Robin ,Just don't answer it.,185,27890
27890,6,15,Marshall ,I can't not answer. It's impolite.,186,27891
27891,6,15,Robin ,"Marshall, you can beat this.",187,27892
27892,6,15,Marshall ,I can't turn my back on politeness.,188,27893
27893,6,15,Robin ,You don't have to answer. You can just let it ring.,189,27894
27894,6,15,Marshall ,"Good manners are what separate us from those ""elbows on the table"" Wisconsinites.",190,27895
27895,6,15,Robin ,"You can do this. I believe in you. Don't do it, Marshall!",191,27896
27896,6,15,Marshall ,"I'm sorry, Robin! Eriksen residence. Marshall speaking.",192,27897
27897,6,15,Honey ,"Hi. I spent the night with your friend Barney and he accidentally left his phone in my apartment, in the garbage. But I've been going through all of his contacts because I'm sure he wants to get in touch with me. After all, he told me, uh... I was his first.",193,27898
27898,6,15,Marshall ,"Oh, honey. Oh! Honey! Zoey's cousin.",194,27899

27904,6,15,,"Barney, sobbing: I don't know.",200,27905
27905,6,15,Honey ,I guess he recently decided to get in touch with his dad. His mom gave him the guy's address.,201,27906
27906,6,15,Barney ,So I wrote him a letter. And I poured my heart out. And I gave him my number and I told him to call me. And he still hasn't called me.,202,27907
27907,6,15,Honey ,"Oh, honey.",203,27908
27908,6,15,Barney ,"I mean, I shouldn't be surprised. Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me.",204,27909
27909,6,15,Honey ,"Oh, honey.",205,27910
27910,6,15,Barney ,"I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son.",206,27911
27911,6,15,Honey ,"Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you. He's ashamed of himself. I mean, look at you. You're do so great without him. I mean, you have an airline and three Nobel Prizes, and you play for the Yankees.",207,27912
27912,6,15,Barney ,Four. Four Nobel Prizes.,208,27913
27913,6,15,Honey ,"Four. See? That is impressive. I mean, how many does he have?",209,27914
27914,6,15,Barney ,Only three.,210,27915
27915,6,15,Honey ,"Well, there you go.",211,27916
27916,6,15,Marshall ,"Hey, uh, listen, Honey, while I've got you, do you have any idea what kind of difficult stuff Zoey's been going through?",212,27917
27917,6,15,Honey ,"Oh, I can't tell you about that. The only people that are allowed to know are me, Zoey and her therapist.",213,27918
27918,6,15,Marshall ,I am her therapist.,214,27919
27919,6,15,Honey ,"Oh! Well, in that case...",215,27920
27920,6,15,Marshall ,"Uh, okay, listen, I think we've made great progress for today. I got to go. Bye. Mom! Marcus!",216,27921
27921,6,15,Zoey ,What's this really about?,217,27922
27922,6,15,Ted ,I told you. Lily hates you.,218,27923
27923,6,15,Zoey ,"I think you hate me. I think you have some big problem with me, and you're too chicken to come out and say it.",219,27924
27924,6,15,Ted ,All right. Yes. I... hate you.,220,27925
27925,6,15,Zoey ,Great. See? Was that so hard?,221,27926
27926,6,15,Ted ,Zoey.,222,27927
27927,6,15,Zoey ,"Can you at least tell me why? Because I'm racking my brain here, and I thought... I just want to know why.",223,27928
27928,6,15,Marshall ,"So we got Ted and Zoey. Ted is in love with Zoey. Zoey has no idea. Then Zoey's cousin Honey went home with Barney, and Zoey was happy about it. Which tells us what?",224,27929
27929,6,15,Marcus ,Zoey's in love with...,225,27930
27930,6,15,Marshall ,"Zoey's in love with Ted and Ted doesn't know. So Ted and Zoey... they're in love with each other, which would be fine if Zoey wasn't married to Colonel Mustard. I mean, The Captain. Except now, as Honey informs me...",226,27931
27931,6,15,Ted ,And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.,227,27932
27932,6,15,Zoey ,"Fine, I will, uh, make it happen. Good-bye. Okay. Well... I guess I'll take it.",228,27933
27933,6,15,Marshall ,Zoey and The Captain are getting divorced. Which means...?,229,27934
27934,6,15,Marcus ,"So help me, Marshall, if you don't call those two crazy, mixed-up kids, I will.",230,27935
27935,6,15,Marshall ,Give me that phone.,231,27936
27936,6,15,Ted ,"Why do I hate you? Are you kidding? Uh, you're actively trying to prevent me from realizing a lifelong dream. So there's that. Plus, you're stubborn and-and-and argumentative. And what kind of name is Zoey, huh? What is that, short for Zoseph? (cell phone ringing) Go on, get it. I'll have more in a second.",232,27937
27937,6,15,Zoey ,"Hello. Oh, hey, Marshall...Yes, I am...Yes, I am...He is?...Bye.",233,27938
27938,6,15,Ted ,Why was Marshall calling?,234,27939
27939,6,15,Zoey ,Don't worry about it. Go on.,235,27940
27940,6,15,Ted ,"You talk during movies. You-You-You sneeze with your whole body. Uh, to my knowledge, you do not speak Portuguese.",236,27941
27941,6,15,Zoey ,"Well, actually... (speaking Portuguese)",237,27942
27942,6,15,Ted ,You're a show-off.,238,27943
27943,6,15,Zoey ,You better take that.,239,27944
27944,6,15,Ted ,"Uh, hey, Marshall, can I call you back? I'm out in the hallway with... She is? She is? Marshall, I got to go.",240,27945
27945,6,15,Neighbour ,They're kissing.,241,27946
27946,6,15,Marshall ,They're kissing?! Yeah! (screams) They're kissing!,242,27947
27947,6,16,,"Ted from 2030: My first kiss with Zoey was amazing, and complicated.",1,27948
27948,6,16,Ted ,"Look, um... I know you're going through a lot right now. Getting divorced, being single, figuring out who you are on your own.",2,27949
27949,6,16,Zoey ,Someone knows how to set a mood.,3,27950
27950,6,16,Ted ,I just mean... I'm okay taking this slow. I want to do this right.,4,27951
27951,6,16,,"Ted from 2030: My friends, as usual, were completely supportive.",5,27952
27952,6,16,Barney ," You're doing this all wrong! Ted, there are couples in my kindergarten class who have moved faster than you two. Granted, their home lives are not great.",6,27953
27953,6,16,Ted ,"Hey, I'm trying. I keep suggesting these big, romantic dates, and she keeps putting on the brakes. Like tonight, she wants me to just come over and bake cookies.",7,27954
27954,6,16,Robin , Oh. Translation: booty-call.,8,27955
27955,6,16,Barney , Total booty-call.,9,27956

27957,6,16,Ted ,That's crazy. She-She wants to bake.,11,27958
27958,6,16,Robin ," Guys booty-call girls after 2:00 a.m. with a drunkenly slurred, ""What ya doing?"" But when a lady booty-calls a guy, she invents a respectable excuse to mask the fact that she wants to get stuck real good.",12,27959
27959,6,16,Lily ,"It's called class, Ted.",13,27960
27960,6,16,Ted ,"Wait. That... You think that's what she means by ""baking cookies""?",14,27961
27961,6,16,Lily ,"Are you kidding? You're in the kitchen, it's getting hot, you start licking stuff off each others' fingers. Before you know it, she's bent over the marble island, and you're spanking her with a rubber spatula. And she's screaming, ""Stop, Marshall, stop,"" but that's just code for ""harder!""",15,27962
27962,6,16,Ted ,"Marshall's been in Minnesota a while, huh?",16,27963
27963,6,16,Lily ,So long! And now he's staying even longer. His mom has been having a really hard time since the funeral. He's waiting on her hand and foot. But... it's Valentine's Day. It's not going to be the same without the two of us watching Predator together.,17,27964
27964,6,16,,"Ted from 2030: I should explain. On their very first Valentine's Day, Marshall and Lily set out to watch Sleepless in Seattle.",18,27965
27965,6,16,Marshall ,"You know, I saw this in the theater, like, five times, but I never got to see it with the right girl.",19,27966
27966,6,16,Lily ,I'm so glad none of those girls were right for you.,20,27967
27967,6,16,Marshall ,What girls?,21,27968

27973,6,16,Robin , That's not a thing.,27,27974
27974,6,16,Barney ," It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death.",28,27975
27975,6,16,Ted ,That's actually true.,29,27976
27976,6,16,Barney ," Wait, there's more.",30,27977
27977,6,16,Ted ,This won't be.,31,27978

27983,6,16,Barney ," Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day. That neediness reaches its climax... what up... on February 13. A magical night when a ten has the self-esteem of a four and the depraved enthusiasm of a two. Now, there's only one thing you can't do.",37,27984

27991,6,16,Ted ,And none was taken until just then.,45,27992
27992,6,16,Lily ,I decided to go to Minnesota to see Marshall. He shouldn't have to help his mom through this rough time all by himself.,46,27993

27996,6,16,Lily ,"I call him ""Marshpillow."" And he calls me... nothing because he's a pillow.",50,27997

28004,6,16,Ted ,She thought it was presumptuous and asked me to leave. It's-It's not like I brought a ton of stuff.,58,28005
28005,6,16,Robin , Were there slippers for the morning?,59,28006
28006,6,16,Ted ,"Not slippers, exactly.",60,28007

28009,6,16,Lily ,"How are you holding up, Judy?",63,28010
28010,6,16,Judy ,"Oh, I'm doin' okay. It gets a little lonely. My friends suggested a body pillow, but...(chuckles) I'm not a lunatic.",64,28011

28018,6,16,Judy ,"Well, he was, at first. But once he saw me starting to do better, he kind of regressed. He's been holed up in his room for days at a time, playing old video games. I mean, he is having a pretty sick Dr. Mario run, but...",72,28019
28019,6,16,Lily ,"Uh, I'll talk to him.",73,28020
28020,6,16,Judy ,"I want to be there for him, but it's like he's a teenager again. I even walked in on him abusing himself.",74,28021

28022,6,16,Judy ,"There he was, on the bed, looking at old photos of his dad. That's emotional self-abuse, don't you think?",76,28023

28024,6,16,Zoey ,"No, no, I overreacted. I mean, I invited you over to ""bake cookies."" We both knew what that meant.",78,28025
28025,6,16,Ted ,We totally did.,79,28026
28026,6,16,Zoey ,"I just, you know... I saw those slippers in your bag, and suddenly everything felt really serious. And... ever since, I've been asking myself, ""Am I ready for this?"" And... the answer is ""yes.""",80,28027
28027,6,16,Ted ,They're actually called British morning socks.,81,28028
28028,6,16,Zoey ,Yeah. Don't get in your own way.,82,28029
28029,6,16,Ted ,Right. Okay.,83,28030
28030,6,16,Lily ,"Um, Marshall, your mom asked me to carry this up. She turned her ankle on your Hot Wheels. Is my track okay? It's fine, but, Marshall, I thought you were here taking care of your mom. It seems like she's taking care of you.",84,28031
28031,6,16,Marshall ,"My mom loves to feel needed. Letting her take care of me is how I'm taking care of her. She's in a dark place, Lily. She needs this. Mom? You forgot my chocolate milk with the swirly straw!",85,28032
28032,6,16,Judy ,Oops. Comin' right up!,86,28033
28033,6,16,,"Marshall, whispers: She needs this.",87,28034
28034,6,16,Lily ,"Marshall, tomorrow's Valentine's. Don't you want to be at home on our couch, cuddling up under a warm blanket, watching the Predator use his heat vision to stalk helpless prey?",88,28035
28035,6,16,Marshall ,"Well, baby, we could watch Predator here. No, my mom can go rent it for us after she's done digging out the car.",89,28036
28036,6,16,Lily ,"Marshall, your mom wants you out of here.",90,28037
28037,6,16,Marshall ,What?,91,28038
28038,6,16,Judy ,"Anything else, sweetie?",92,28039
28039,6,16,Marshall ,"Mom, d-do you want me to leave?",93,28040
28040,6,16,Judy ,"Heavens to Bess, no! Of course not!",94,28041
28041,6,16,Lily ,"But, Judy, you said...",95,28042
28042,6,16,Judy ,"Oh, if Marshall could stay here forever, I would be the happiest mom in Minnesota.",96,28043
28043,6,16,Zoey ,So Valentine's Day is tomorrow.,97,28044
28044,6,16,Ted ,"Yeah. You know, there's this new Italian restaurant on 79th that's supposed to be amazing.",98,28045
28045,6,16,Zoey ,"I would be happier having just a simple, home-cooked meal. As long as it's with you.",99,28046
28046,6,16,Ted ,"Tomorrow night, my place.",100,28047
28047,6,16,Zoey ,"I'm ready for this, Ted. I am in it for the long haul. I can't wait for our first Valentine's Day as a couple. The one we'll remember for years.",101,28048
28048,6,16,Ted ,Isn't that great?,102,28049
28049,6,16,Robin ," Yeah, if you say so, yeah.",103,28050
28050,6,16,Ted ,What do you mean?,104,28051
28051,6,16,Robin ," Look, she just got out of a marriage, Ted. That's heavy. I'm kind of freaking out, just listening to you. My heart is pounding, I'm hearing this weird clicking noise.",105,28052
28052,6,16,Ted ,"Well, it's romantic, right? Zoey and I are getting serious on Valentine's Day.",106,28053
28053,6,16,Robin ," See, that just amps up the pressure even more. Boy, it's a good thing that you're sure.",107,28054
28054,6,16,Ted ,"Who said I wasn't sure? I'm glad we're in a serious relationship. Right away. And if I screw this up, I'm the devil, because she's going through a divorce. But I'm not going to screw this up. So stop freaking out, Robin. Stop freaking out!",108,28055
28055,6,16,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, I'm not super proud of what I did next.",109,28056
28056,6,16,Ted ,Hi! I'm here to help Marshall.,110,28057
28057,6,16,,"Ted from 2030: Meanwhile, as Desperation Day turned into Desperation Night...",111,28058
28058,6,16,Barney ," God, these girls are so hungry for male attention. It is like being a hunter and having the deer walk up, tie itself to the hood of your car and beg to get mounted.",112,28059
28059,6,16,Robin ," Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex.",113,28060
28060,6,16,Barney ," Enchanté. That's French for ""What's with the purple?""",114,28061
28061,6,16,Robin ," Well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and everything is pink and red, so Bev very thoughtfully suggested that we wear purple to show how little we care.",115,28062
28062,6,16,Bev ,"I use, uh, colors to express emotion. Purple is for pride. It was a stupid idea.",116,28063
28063,6,16,Anna ,"Bev, you look at me. It's not a stupid idea. Tonight, we are queens.",117,28064
28064,6,16,Robin ," And we don't care about some stupid, sexist, corporate holiday.",118,28065
28065,6,16,Barney ," Please! You might as well be dog-earing a tear-stained bridal magazine while wolfing down the box of chocolates you had delivered to yourself at work from your ""fiancé"" who no one's ever met.",119,28066
28066,6,16,Bev ,Gerard is real!,120,28067
28067,6,16,Lily ,Ted... I thought you were going to talk to Marshall about coming back to New York.,121,28068
28068,6,16,Ted ,"Yeah, but, you know, things move so fast in New York. Why not hang out here until at least after Valentine's Day. Plus, we're helping Marshall's mom. Uh, Mrs. Eriksen, we're running low on SunnyD!",122,28069
28069,6,16,Judy ,Is orange juice okay?,123,28070
28070,6,16,,Ted & Marshall: No!,124,28071
28071,6,16,Barney ," Okay, when your ""fiancé"" Gerard comes back from fixing cleft palates in Peru, maybe snatch a photo of the two of you together, and then I'll totally believe you.",125,28072
28072,6,16,Bev ,"Well, he's going to Kenya after Peru, so...",126,28073
28073,6,16,Nora ,"Hey, guys, so sorry I'm late.",127,28074
28074,6,16,Robin ," Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna beat him in an arm wrestle?",128,28075
28075,6,16,Barney , My elbow slipped!,129,28076
28076,6,16,Lily ,"Marshall, I'm going home.",130,28077
28077,6,16,Marshall ,What?,131,28078
28078,6,16,Lily ,"I'm flying out tonight before the big storm, and I want you to come with me.",132,28079
28079,6,16,Marshall ,"I can't right now, 'cause my mom needs me.",133,28080
28080,6,16,Lily ,While I'm sure it's been really helpful for her to have you here playing Super Mario Kart for 14 hours a day...,134,28081
28081,6,16,Ted ,You have Super Mario Kart?!,135,28082
28082,6,16,Marshall ,"Hell, yeah.",136,28083
28083,6,16,Lily ,But your mom doesn't need you. Your life in New York needs you. It needs you really bad.,137,28084
28084,6,16,Marshall ,"Baby, don't go.",138,28085
28085,6,16,Lily ,Please come home soon.,139,28086
28086,6,16,Barney ," So, you were an Olympic gymnast?",140,28087
28087,6,16,Woman ,Silver medal.,141,28088
28088,6,16,Barney ," Ooh, sorry. Gold's the only thing that really counts.",142,28089
28089,6,16,Woman ,That's what my dad said.,143,28090
28090,6,16,Barney ," And she sticks the landing. Why don't you start stretching, and I'll... be right back. Hey, hey, sorry.",144,28091
28091,6,16,Nora ,"Oh, hi.",145,28092
28092,6,16,Barney , Quick question.,146,28093
28093,6,16,Nora ,Yeah.,147,28094
28094,6,16,Barney , Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends?,148,28095
28095,6,16,Nora ,"Oh, I told them I forgot, but the truth is, I'm kind of protesting their protest. Can you keep a secret?",149,28096
28096,6,16,Barney , Sure.,150,28097
28097,6,16,Nora ,I love Valentine's Day.,151,28098
28098,6,16,Barney ," Oh, my gosh! Me, too! Um, is it getting crowded in here, 'cause I think there are two peas in this pod?",152,28099
28099,6,16,Nora ,"Oh, you're a gooey romantic, too?",153,28100
28100,6,16,Barney ," Guilty. This is embarrassing but every year, I buy flowers and a box of chocolates, even if I'm not with someone. Just in case, you know?",154,28101
28101,6,16,Nora ,We are pitiful.,155,28102
28102,6,16,Barney , The worst.,156,28103
28103,6,16,Nora ,Although there is one difference between you and me.,157,28104
28104,6,16,Barney , What's that?,158,28105
28105,6,16,Nora ,I'm not saying any of this to get in your pants.,159,28106
28106,6,16,Marshall ,"I miss my dad, Ted. I miss him so much.",160,28107
28107,6,16,Ted ,I know.,161,28108
28108,6,16,Marshall ,"Um, when I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula. And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till, like, the middle of the night. And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything.",162,28109
28109,6,16,Barney ," All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13... a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate.",163,28110
28110,6,16,Nora ,"What's desperate about knowing what you want? Look, life is really short, Barney. Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone, distracting yourself from the fact that nobody loves you with some sad little activity?",164,28111
28111,6,16,Barney ," Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie.",165,28112
28112,6,16,Nora ,I have no idea what any of those words mean.,166,28113
28113,6,16,Woman ,"Hey, I'm all stretched out!",167,28114
28114,6,16,Barney , Here's the first thing you need to know about laser tag.,168,28115
28115,6,16,Marshall ,"Thanks a lot for coming out here, man.",169,28116
28116,6,16,Ted ,Yeah.,170,28117
28117,6,16,Marshall ,"Hey, are-are you sure it's okay with Zoey that you're here for Valentine's Day?",171,28118
28118,6,16,Ted ,"Well, I mean, technically, she doesn't know yet.",172,28119
28119,6,16,Marshall ,What?,173,28120
28120,6,16,Ted ,"Things with Zoey are moving really fast, and the divorce just makes everything more complicated. I just, I needed to take a step back.",174,28121
28121,6,16,Marshall ,"You're not taking a step back. You're running away. And hiding out here, hiding out here is not gonna solve anything. You're just holed up in Minnesota because you're too scared to face reality, and it's... We got to go back to New York, tonight.",175,28122
28122,6,16,Ted ,We're snowed in. Lily got the last flight.,176,28123
28123,6,16,Marshall ,"So, we drive. It's time. It's time to get back to real life. It's time to grow up. Yeah Mom! Can you make us some PB and J's for the road?",177,28124
28124,6,16,Ted ,Crusts cut off.,178,28125
28125,6,16,Marshall ,"Crusts cut off! No, Ted. What are we...? We're men. Mom! Leave the crusts on! They forced their opponents to scatter, picking them off, one by one, in a swift and merciless slaughter.",179,28126
28126,6,16,Barney ,...became the 2010 Tri-County Champions.,180,28127
28127,6,16,Nora ,Wow. Laser tag sounds brilliant!,181,28128
28128,6,16,Barney ," Oh, it is. Plus, if you win, you get free pizza. This is my teammate for tomorrow.",182,28129
28129,6,16,Robin ," Oh, yeah, I agreed to that.",183,28130
28130,6,16,Nora ,Where are Bev and Anna?,184,28131
28131,6,16,Robin , Well...,185,28132
28132,6,16,Bev ,"So, we're taking off.",186,28133
28133,6,16,Robin , What?,187,28134
28134,6,16,Anna ,Those guys are gonna buy us hot dogs at Grey's Papaya.,188,28135
28135,6,16,Robin ," What...? So that's it? A couple of white Urkels offer you sausages, and you're gone? What about the sisterhood? Solidarity? The color purple?",189,28136
28136,6,16,Bev ,But tomorrow's Valentine's Day.,190,28137
28137,6,16,Robin , I thought we didn't care about Valentine's Day.,191,28138
28138,6,16,Anna ,"Look, Robin, you'll find someone, too. You're a queen. You've got so much to offer. Maybe do something with that hair.",192,28139
28139,6,16,Barney ," I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news.",193,28140
28140,6,16,Nora ,"Well, I think I'm heading out, too.",194,28141
28141,6,16,Barney ," What? No, don't go! You want to see a magic trick?!",195,28142
28142,6,16,Nora ,"It's late, and I have a date with my pillow. I mean, not literally. I'm not a lunatic. Boy Scout Troop 15 doesn't stand a chance. Bye.",196,28143
28143,6,16,Robin , Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day...,197,28144
28144,6,16,Barney , What are you talking about?,198,28145
28145,6,16,Robin ," Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora.",199,28146
28146,6,16,Barney ," No, I don't. She's gross.",200,28147
28147,6,16,Robin , Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain.,201,28148
28148,6,16,Barney , Whatever you say.,202,28149
28149,6,16,Robin ," Oh, hey, Nora.",203,28150
28150,6,16,Barney , Nora...,204,28151
28151,6,16,MARVIN ,"Here's a secret. I couldn't see worth a damn, either, buddy. I just kept driving forward, hoping for the best. Look out! Gotcha.",205,28152
28152,6,16,,"Ted from 2030: And so we drove through the night, out of Desperation Day and into Valentine's. And there was no trace of my little freak out, except...",206,28153
28153,6,16,Zoey ,Really? An overnight bag for your own living room? Looks like we got a matching set.,207,28154
28154,6,16,Ted ,"Well, that was kind of presumptuous.",208,28155
28155,6,16,Barney ," The ground was shaking like. Robin, where are you? Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot since last year. They're terrifying!",209,28156
28156,6,16,Robin ," Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day.",210,28157
28157,6,16,Barney , Hap...?,211,28158
28158,6,16,Nora ,"Hey, Barney. Robin told me to meet you guys here.",212,28159

28164,6,16,Marshall ,"Happy Valentine's Day, Lily Pad. Oh.",218,28165
28165,6,16,Lily ,We both knew this would end eventually.,219,28166
28166,6,17,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, sometimes wonderful things come out of horrible situations. Like, remember that trip I took to Hong Kong where I got stuck in the airport? Well, a funny thing happened that day.",1,28167
28167,6,17,Ted ,"Yes, I realize it's raining, but, come on, it's 2021. We can make cell phones that project holograms, but a light drizzle shuts down a whole airport?",2,28168
28168,6,17,Wendy ,"Hey, Ted.",3,28169
28169,6,17,Ted ,Hey... There she is. Wow.,4,28170
28170,6,17,Wendy ,Wendy the Waitress.,5,28171
28171,6,17,Ted ,Wendy the Waitress! I was just saying-- what are you doing here?,6,28172
28172,6,17,,"Ted from 2030: What was she doing there? For that, we have to back up about ten years.",7,28173
28173,6,17,Robin ,"So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.",8,28174
28174,6,17,Barney ,I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.,9,28175
28175,6,17,Robin ,Not according to her.,10,28176
28176,6,17,Nora ,"Oh, my God, this was so much fun. We have to do this again. We do, we have to.",11,28177
28177,6,17,Barney ,You want to grab a drink right now?,12,28178
28178,6,17,Nora ,"No, I'm kind of tired. But... this is my number. Give me a call.",13,28179
28179,6,17,Barney ,Absolutely.,14,28180
28180,6,17,Robin ,How is that a disaster?,15,28181
28181,6,17,Barney ,"She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well...",16,28182
28182,6,17,Barney ,You want to grab a drink right now?,17,28183
28183,6,17,Nora ,"No, I'm kind of tired.",18,28184
28184,6,17,Barney ,Absolutely.,19,28185
28185,6,17,Barney ,"It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids.",20,28186
28186,6,17,Robin ,"Please, Cheese. You like this girl.",21,28187
28187,6,17,Barney ,"What? Nora? No, I don't.",22,28188
28188,6,17,Robin ,"Barney, you can't say her name without smiling.",23,28189
28189,6,17,Barney ,"That's... Nora. Sorry, sorry. I was thinking of a funny thing that Nora said. Hmm. Stop it. No... ra. Nah... Damn it, what is the matter with me?",24,28190
28190,6,17,Robin ,You like her. You should call her.,25,28191
28191,6,17,Barney ,"Call her? she had a nice face, her booty was in place, but Barney don't chase.",26,28192
28192,6,17,Robin ,"That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice.",27,28193
28193,6,17,Barney ,Totally.,28,28194
28194,6,17,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, I had just started dating Zoey. And when you first start dating someone, everyone wants to know the same thing. How did we meet?",29,28195

28196,6,17,Ted ,"No, it's a cute story. Once upon a time...",31,28197

28198,6,17,Zoey ,"Oh, man, this movie is scary.",33,28199
28199,6,17,Ted ,"I know, right? But then one day, Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight. He flipped out and demanded a divorce. And she was heartbroken. But after a little soul-searching, she ended up back in my and the rest, as they say, is history.",34,28200
28200,6,17,Woman ,"Actually, I said, ""How's your meat?""",35,28201
28201,6,17,Ted ,Oh. A little cold.,36,28202
28202,6,17,Woman ,"Gee, wonder why.",37,28203
28203,6,17,Zoey ,"Oh, Ted, did you have a chance to pick up that box I left at my old apartment?",38,28204
28204,6,17,Ted ,"Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain. I mean this in a super manly way. That guy scares the panties off me.",39,28205
28205,6,17,Zoey ,You don't have to see him. He left the box with the doorman.,40,28206
28206,6,17,Ted ,"If it's really important to you, I will pick it up tomorrow.",41,28207
28207,6,17,Marshall ,"All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big meaningless stack of paperwork that I have to get off my desk to make room for tomorrow's big meaningless stack of paperwork. But it's all worth it, you know, 'cause at least I know I'm making the world a... place. All right, see you guys later.",42,28208
28208,6,17,Ted ,I'm worried about Marshall. He doesn't seem like himself lately.,43,28209
28209,6,17,Lily ,"Yeah, he's been really... quiet.",44,28210
28210,6,17,Robin ,"Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man.",45,28211
28211,6,17,Barney ,Like Prince.,46,28212
28212,6,17,Lily ,"No, it's more than that. It's like, all the stuff he used to love, he suddenly has no interest in anymore.",47,28213
28213,6,17,Barney ,Oh. Ha-wink,48,28214
28214,6,17,Lily ,Excuse me?,49,28215
28215,6,17,Barney ,"Lily, in my travels, I've developed a finely calibrated sense of how long it's been since... How do I not put this delicately?... a girl's been porked. And, boo, you've been pork-free so long, you're practically kosher.",50,28216
28216,6,17,Lily ,It's been a while.,51,28217
28217,6,17,Barney ,"Five weeks, three days by my estimation.",52,28218
28218,6,17,Lily ,You should work at a carnival.,53,28219
28219,6,17,Barney ,I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds.,54,28220
28220,6,17,Ted ,"Anyway, we should get going.",55,28221
28221,6,17,Lily ,"Yeah, I'll walk out with you guys.",56,28222
28222,6,17,Robin ,"Good night. Good night, guys.",57,28223
28223,6,17,Barney ,18 weeks.,58,28224
28224,6,17,Robin ,"Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and...",59,28225
28225,6,17,Barney ,"Shh. Child, listen. If you're really hurting for it, I'd be more than happy to throw you one.",60,28226
28226,6,17,Robin ,Throw me one? Yeah.,61,28227
28227,6,17,Barney ,We're exes. We're probably due for a backslide. Or we could just do it the normal way.,62,28228
28228,6,17,Robin ,"Oh, I see what's going on.",63,28229
28229,6,17,Barney ,Yeah?,64,28230
28230,6,17,Robin ,"This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your shot. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care.",65,28231
28231,6,17,Barney ,"Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my shot?",66,28232
28232,6,17,Robin ,Nora met a guy. What?!,67,28233
28233,6,17,Barney ,What?,68,28234
28234,6,17,Robin ,Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.,69,28235
28235,6,17,Barney ,"But ""L'Amour"" means love! They're going to the cafe of love! I'm fine. It's fine. Point is, Robin, I don't even like Nora. Damn it!",70,28236
28236,6,17,Lily ,"Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed?",71,28237
28237,6,17,Marshall ,I can't sleep.,72,28238
28238,6,17,Lily ,Mmm. Anything I can do to help you with that?,73,28239
28239,6,17,Marshall ,Maybe after this documentary on garbage.,74,28240
28240,6,17,Lily ,"Man, I am losing my touch.",75,28241
28241,6,17,Tv ,"Nearly twice the size of Texas, the Gweat Pacific Garbage Patch, or ""Garbage Island,"" is an enviwonmental disaster. Sepawated from its pawents, this young bird stwuggles to survive, stwangling itself in the plastic wings of a six-pack. Marshall Eriksen, I think you know what you have to do.",76,28242
28242,6,17,Marshall ,I have to save the planet!,77,28243
28243,6,17,Lily ,Is it over? I call on top.,78,28244
28244,6,17,,"Ted from 2030: A few days later, I headed over to The Captain's building to get Zoey's box.",79,28245
28245,6,17,Ted ,I'm here to...,80,28246
28246,6,17,Captain ,Ted. What a surprise. Ted.,81,28247
28247,6,17,Ted ,Captain. I...,82,28248
28248,6,17,,Captain:You've come to rescue me from the capsized wreckage of my marriage. Mm... I hesitated calling you because I know you and Zoey were friendly.,83,28249
28249,6,17,Ted ,"Pssh, nah...",84,28250
28250,6,17,,"Captain:But my wife has left me. All my friends have abandoned me. Please, tell me you're on my side. Let's adjourn to the study.",85,28251
28251,6,17,Marshall ,Garbage Island. You haven't heard of Garbage Island? It's an island... made of garbage! It's in the Pacific Ocean. It's twice the size of Texas!,86,28252
28252,6,17,Robin ,"In other words, one-eighth the size of Canada. So...",87,28253
28253,6,17,Marshall ,"Guys, I'm going environmental, okay? Phase one: the bar. I've already convinced MacLaren's to implement a new green initiative.",88,28254
28254,6,17,Wendy ,That's 'cause of you? I got to carry an 80-pound bag of bottles to the recycling center every night. I threw my back out.,89,28255
28255,6,17,Marshall ,You're welcome... Earth. Phase two: GNB. Tomorrow I'm going to make a presentation in front of the board about how we can cut our carbon footprint by half for only $12 million.,90,28256
28256,6,17,Barney ,"Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is ""$12 million,"" and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance.",91,28257
28257,6,17,Ted ,"Guys, I got a problem. I ran into The Captain.",92,28258
28258,6,17,,"Captain:Ted, beneath this lustrous mane,I wear the horns of a cuckold. Zoey left me for another man.",93,28259
28259,6,17,Ted ,Wow.,94,28260
28260,6,17,,Captain:Do you have any idea who it could be?,95,28261
28261,6,17,,Ted from 2030: The Captain then told a story much different than the one I'd been telling. But one maybe just as true.,96,28262
28262,6,17,Captain ,"Once upon a time, Zoey and I were happy. Blissful as Arcadian shepherds. I was Poseidon, she my Amphitrite. I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis could not have torn us asunder. We had great big boners for each other. But then... enter the scoundrel. I don't know what he looks like, but I picture him with a mustache.",97,28263
28263,6,17,Ted ,Yes! Limit the search to guys with mustaches. Smart.,98,28264
28264,6,17,Captain ,"Anyway, soon the inevitable happened. She told me she was in love with someone else. Obviously, it made me angry.",99,28265
28265,6,17,Ted ,And that's the last time you saw her.,100,28266
28266,6,17,Captain ,"But I gathered my composure, and told her I'd do anything to keep her. I begged her not to leave. We made love that night.",101,28267
28267,6,17,Ted ,That's damn good brandy.,102,28268
28268,6,17,Captain ,"But morning came, and she was gone.",103,28269
28269,6,17,Ted ,"Oh, Captain... don't blame yourself.",104,28270
28270,6,17,Captain ,I don't blame myself. Hmm? There's only one man I blame for this.,105,28271
28271,6,17,Ted ,Me. I'm the bad guy.,106,28272
28272,6,17,Robin ,"Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero.",107,28273
28273,6,17,Ted ,Damn it! The box!,108,28274
28274,6,17,Marshall ,"Baby, baby, I really got to work on this presentation.",109,28275
28275,6,17,Lily ,"Oh, that's too bad, 'cause I was going to make a little presentation of my own.",110,28276
28276,6,17,Marshall ,"Okay, why not: from now until tomorrow afternoon, I do this, and then tomorrow night, I do that.",111,28277
28277,6,17,Lily ,"Deal. Come on, come on.",112,28278
28278,6,17,Marshall ,Lily!,113,28279
28279,6,17,Barney ,"You lying little minx. I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight from 5:00 p.m. until closing, reading a newspaper with two holes cut out of it, and I never saw Nora or this Italian race car driver she's dating.",114,28280
28280,6,17,Robin ,Sorry. Who said anything about an...?,115,28281
28281,6,17,Barney ,"Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver.",116,28282
28282,6,17,Robin ,"No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten.",117,28283
28283,6,17,Barney ,"No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite!",118,28284
28284,6,17,Robin ,"You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship.",119,28285
28285,6,17,Barney ,"No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great pen1s comes great responsibility.",120,28286
28286,6,17,Robin ,"Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one.",121,28287
28287,6,17,Barney ,Sorry?,122,28288
28288,6,17,Robin ,"I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve.",123,28289
28289,6,17,Barney ,"Careful, Robin, I'll do it.",124,28290
28290,6,17,Robin ,"Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place.",125,28291
28291,6,17,Barney ,"Don't poke the dragon, Robin, 'cause the dragon will poke you back.",126,28292
28292,6,17,Lily ,"s*x now, we'll do the foreplay after.",127,28293
28293,6,17,Marshall ,"Oh, no, baby, come on. Today didn't go so well.",128,28294
28294,6,17,Marshall ,"The green initiative, for only $12 million, will change the way...",129,28295
28295,6,17,Arthur ,"Okay, I've heard enough. Don't we already have a green initiative? I mean, didn't we do a whole thing? Hang a banner, make a video, Sting was there. I thought I met Sting.",130,28296
28296,6,17,Man ,You did meet Sting.,131,28297
28297,6,17,Arthur ,"Yeah, I met Sting. So why on Earth would we spend another $12 million?",132,28298
28298,6,17,Marshall ,"Well, because we can always do more.",133,28299
28299,6,17,Arthur ,"Yeah, but I met Sting.",134,28300
28300,6,17,Marshall ,"Well, meeting Sting isn't gonna fix anything, Arthur!",135,28301
28301,6,17,Arthur ,Who here supports Eriksen's proposal?,136,28302
28302,6,17,Meeker ,"Well, he has some good points.",137,28303
28303,6,17,Arthur ,"Meeker, you're fired! And as for you, Eriksen...",138,28304
28304,6,17,Man ,His father just died.,139,28305
28305,6,17,,Arthur:...nice presentation. We'll keep it under advisement.,140,28306
28306,6,17,Marshall ,Meeker got fired because of me. I'm the bad guy.,141,28307
28307,6,17,Lily ,"No, sweetie, just-just put all that out of your mind and relax. Look, I got you a six-pack of tall boys from the deli.",142,28308
28308,6,17,Marshall ,"Hey, baby.",143,28309
28309,6,17,Lily ,Yeah?,144,28310
28310,6,17,Marshall ,What happened to the plastic rings that held the six-pack together?,145,28311
28311,6,17,Lily ,"Oh, I-I don't know. I threw them down the garbage chute. Let's just use the handcuffs instead.",146,28312
28312,6,17,Marshall ,"Baby, birds can get caught in those and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish! Weren't you listening? Don't you care about Garbage Island?",147,28313
28313,6,17,Lily ,"Marshall, right now, I don't give a wat's ass about Garbage Island.",148,28314
28314,6,17,Marshall ,"Well, I do. I got to find those rings!",149,28315
28315,6,17,Lily ,Cwap.,150,28316
28316,6,17,Ted ,"Hi, I'm here to pick up...",151,28317
28317,6,17,Captain ,"Hello, Ted.",152,28318
28318,6,17,Ted ,To the study?,153,28319
28319,6,17,Captain ,To the study! Mmm. Ted... I know.,154,28320
28320,6,17,Ted ,Know what?,155,28321
28321,6,17,Captain ,"I know who stole my Zoey. No man likes to be betrayed, especially by a friend. You can imagine then how painful it was when I learned that the name of my betrayer is... Ted... when I tell you who it is, you're gonna... It's my doorman!",156,28322
28322,6,17,Ted ,That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?,157,28323
28323,6,17,Captain ,"He always winks and tips his hat when he sees her. I know how these things work. He holds her package, and pretty soon, she's holding his. And then there's his glorious mustache. I will have him fired for this!",158,28324
28324,6,17,Ted ,"No, no, no, you can't fire him.",159,28325
28325,6,17,Captain ,You're right. Maritime protocol demands physical retribution!,160,28326
28326,6,17,Ted ,"Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop!",161,28327
28327,6,17,Captain ,"Who is this flower child, and what has he done with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?!",162,28328
28328,6,17,Ted ,"Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!",163,28329
28329,6,17,Captain ,"Whoa, ""rapscallion"" may be going a bit far, Ted.",164,28330
28330,6,17,Ted ,"But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that.",165,28331
28331,6,17,Captain ,"Why couldn't she just like boats? Just to have one thing in common? Other girls like boats, don't they?",166,28332
28332,6,17,Ted ,Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey.,167,28333
28333,6,17,Captain ,"When you put it that way, I should almost thank the doorman.",168,28334
28334,6,17,Ted ,"Yeah, yeah! And, you know, since, since it doesn't really matter who Zoey's dating now...",169,28335
28335,6,17,Captain ,"It doesn't, it really doesn't. It doesn't.",170,28336
28336,6,17,Ted ,It's me. You're welcome.,171,28337
28337,6,17,Lily ,"Okay, baby, what gives?",172,28338
28338,6,17,Marshall ,"I'm sorry, but neither of us are getting any action until I find those rings.",173,28339
28339,6,17,Lily ,I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.,174,28340
28340,6,17,Barney ,"All right, Robin, give it to me.",175,28341
28341,6,17,Robin ,"Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, ""Yeah, Barney, go get her!"" But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.",176,28342
28342,6,17,Barney ,"The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?",177,28343
28343,6,17,Robin ,"It's a five, idiot.",178,28344
28344,6,17,Barney ,A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?,179,28345
28345,6,17,Robin ,"""Moon man language""? What does that even mean?",180,28346
28346,6,17,Barney ,How am I supposed to see that's a five?,181,28347
28347,6,17,Robin ,Look how you taped this up...,182,28348
28348,6,17,Barney ,"Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make.",183,28349
28349,6,17,Robin ,Barney. Go get her.,184,28350
28350,6,17,Ted ,"Listen, Zoey, I need to ask you something. Did I steal you?",185,28351
28351,6,17,Zoey ,"Well... yeah. You did. By being the kind of sweet, thoughtful guy who'd never even think of stealing someone, you stole me.",186,28352
28352,6,17,Ted ,So I'm the bad guy. Great.,187,28353
28353,6,17,Zoey ,"Well, the story isn't over, Ted. It'll be years before we know who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. I mean, yes, divorce sucks, but sometimes things need to fall apart to make way for better things.",188,28354
28354,6,17,Ted ,If you say so.,189,28355
28355,6,17,Zoey ,"I'm just saying, the eggs are already broken. Let's make sure we get a pretty good omelet out of it.",190,28356
28356,6,17,Lily ,"Okay, Marshall, seriously, what's going on?",191,28357
28357,6,17,Marshall ,He'll never get to see how I turn out.,192,28358
28358,6,17,Lily ,What do you mean?,193,28359
28359,6,17,Marshall ,"My dad. You know, I used to, um, I used to always tell him that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer. And he was always so proud of me for that. But he never got to see the version of me that was anything but a corporate stooge. And now it's too late. And we're starting a family, you know.",194,28360
28360,6,17,Lily ,Are you avoiding sleeping with me 'cause you don't want to start a family?,195,28361
28361,6,17,Marshall ,"Lily, if we have a baby right now, that is just it for me. The cement will dry, and I will be stuck at GNB forever.",196,28362
28362,6,17,Lily ,"Marshall, if you want to quit your job and go work for the NRDC right now, then you need to do that right now. And then, once you've cleaned up all the oceans and saved the planet... you know, like, a year from now... then we'll start a family.",197,28363
28363,6,17,Marshall ,"I don't know. So far, in the name of saving the planet, I've ruined your night, I practically broke Wendy's back and I got Meeker fired. The guy must hate me.",198,28364
28364,6,17,Lily ,Meeker doesn't hate you.,199,28365
28365,6,17,,"Ted from 2030: Oh, Meeker hated him, all right. After all, Marshall was the one who got him fired. Meeker knew we all hung out at MacLaren's. So that night, he went there to confront Marshall. But as luck would have it...",200,28366
28366,6,17,Meeker ,Are you guys...?,201,28367
28367,6,17,Wendy ,Closed. Sorry. Thanks.,202,28368
28368,6,17,Meeker ,Rough night?,203,28369
28369,6,17,Wendy ,Yeah.,204,28370
28370,6,17,Meeker ,I'm sorry.,205,28371
28371,6,17,Wendy ,It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. Except for Marshall Eriksen.,206,28372
28372,6,17,Meeker ,What did you just say?,207,28373
28373,6,17,Wendy ,"Uh, I said it's Marshall Eriksen's fault. Why, do you know him?",208,28374
28374,6,17,Meeker ,Know him? I hate that guy.,209,28375
28375,6,17,Wendy ,"Me, too.",210,28376
28376,6,17,Meeker ,"Well, hey.",211,28377
28377,6,17,,"Ted from 2030: And the rest, as they say...is history.",212,28378
28378,6,17,Wendy ,"And three kids later, we decided to come here on our second honeymoon.",213,28379
28379,6,17,Ted ,Wow. That's a pretty good omelet.,214,28380
28380,6,17,Wendy ,"Oh, and hey, what about you? You still with Zoey?",215,28381
28381,6,17,Ted ,"No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well. But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids. It's actually a funny story of how we met. I was a best man at this wedding...",216,28382
28382,6,17,Wendy ,"Listen, Ted, it's great seeing you, but we got to run.",217,28383
28383,6,17,Ted ,"Okay, well, have a safe trip. It was great seeing you. (Ted phones Marshall) Hello. Marshall.",218,28384
28384,6,17,Marshall ,"Hey, Ted.",219,28385
28385,6,17,Ted ,Hey. You will not believe who I just ran into.,220,28386
28386,6,18,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, the heart is a mysterious muscle. You never really know what's going on in there. So after Uncle Marshall lost his father, he decided to get his heart checked. And so did I... and so did Lily... and so did Robin. And then Marshall went again, just to be sure. There was only one holdout.",1,28387
28387,6,18,Barney ,"I don't need to go to a heart doctor. I drink every day, I sleep three hours every night, and I have multiple s*x partners. I'm doing everything right.",2,28388
28388,6,18,Ted ,"Barney, come on, this is important. We need you around for a long time. Without you, we'd have to find some other sex-fueled, depraved animal to entertain us.",3,28389

28392,6,18,Robin , You wouldn't have to take care of it.,7,28393
28393,6,18,Ted ,Really? And who watered the philodendron on your bookcase and sang it back to life?,8,28394
28394,6,18,Robin ," Yeah, that was made out of silk, Ted.",9,28395
28395,6,18,Marshall ,"Okay, Robin, what you need is indeed something that buries a bone, but I'm not talking about a dog. I'm talking about a man.",10,28396
28396,6,18,Robin , Here we go.,11,28397
28397,6,18,Marshall ,"You're clearly trying to fill a hole... in her heart. You feel like the seventh wheel, because now Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora and Lily's with Big Fudge.",12,28398
28398,6,18,Barney ,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge. ""With""? I am not ""with"" Nora. Wrong preposition. Later tonight I'm hoping to be on Nora, right? Or under Nora, right? Or, we're all adults, I'll just say it... behind Nora.",13,28399
28399,6,18,Robin , I don't know. This will be your second date.,14,28400
28400,6,18,Lily ,"Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl.",15,28401

28404,6,18,Barney ,Never go out with the same girl more than once.,19,28405
28405,6,18,Lily ,Then why are you going out with Nora again?,20,28406
28406,6,18,Barney ,There is an exception.,21,28407
28407,6,18,,Ted from 2030: And it was always the same exception.,22,28408

28409,6,18,Barney ,"And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it. (He sneezes)",24,28410
28410,6,18,Barney ,"Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold.",25,28411
28411,6,18,Nora ,"Oh, no. How long have you been sick?",26,28412
28412,6,18,Barney ,About 20 minutes. Can't seem to shake it.,27,28413
28413,6,18,Nora ,"Okay, 'cause I was going to say you look a little...",28,28414
28414,6,18,Barney ,Handsome? Rich? Well-endowed?,29,28415

28416,6,18,Barney ,The bed... that's where all the...happens.,31,28417
28417,6,18,Nora ,"Come on, let's get you sorted out.",32,28418
28418,6,18,,"Ted from 2030: That night, Barney didn't take care of business. Instead, Nora took care of Barney.",33,28419
28419,6,18,Barney ,Ah. Thank you.,34,28420
28420,6,18,Nora ,"Good night, Barney.",35,28421

28429,6,18,Robin , What? You told me to meet someone.,44,28430
28430,6,18,Marshall ,"I know, and, look, he seems plenty nice, but I didn't mean bring home the first guy you bump into on the street.",45,28431
28431,6,18,Robin ," Actually, I met him in the park.",46,28432
28432,6,18,Ted ,Should have just let you get a dog.,47,28433

28437,6,18,Barney ,Yes!,52,28438
28438,6,18,Lily ,"Okay, fine. On one condition. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora. She seems like something special.",53,28439
28439,6,18,Barney ,"Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.* Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang *",54,28440

28445,6,18,The cardiologist, Although it seems like you might have a slight arrhythmia.,60,28446
28446,6,18,Lily ,"Ow! Nails, nails!",61,28447
28447,6,18,The cardiologist," It's probably nothing to worry about, but I'd like you to wear this heart monitor for the next 24 hours.",62,28448
28448,6,18,Barney ,"Twen... Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight.",63,28449
28449,6,18,The cardiologist, Don't worry. It's totally safe. Unless part of your big date involves connecting yourself to a car battery.,64,28450
28450,6,18,Barney ,"Well, now it doesn't.",65,28451
28451,6,18,,"Ted from 2030: And exactly 24 hours later, they returned for the results.",66,28452
28452,6,18,The cardiologist," Okay, everything looks fine here, although I did notice a few irregularities. There's nothing to be...alarmed about.",67,28453
28453,6,18,Barney ,"Go on, Doctor.",68,28454
28454,6,18,The cardiologist, What happened at 8:46 p.m. last night?,69,28455
28455,6,18,Barney ,"Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner.",70,28456
28456,6,18,Nora ,"This might be a little forward, but do you have a b*mb strapped to your chest?",71,28457
28457,6,18,Barney ,"This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing.",72,28458
28458,6,18,Nora ,"Oh, I'm so sorry. I've been trying not to stare at your chest all night.",73,28459
28459,6,18,Barney ,What's that like?,74,28460
28460,6,18,Nora ,So is everything okay?,75,28461
28461,6,18,Barney ,"My friend's dad passed away from a sudden heart attack. So I'm just getting myself checked out, too.",76,28462
28462,6,18,Nora ,"Oh, I am so sorry.",77,28463
28463,6,18,Barney ,Thanks.,78,28464
28464,6,18,Nora ,"Um, Barney, what I'm about to say is going to sound a little weird, but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it.",79,28465
28465,6,18,Barney ,"Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just... No. What is it?",80,28466
28466,6,18,Nora ,"I want to get married. I mean, not tonight, or even to you, necessarily. But that's what I want. And if that's going to scare you off, then I'd rather it scare you off now. I want a family, and I want to live in a little house with a garden and a tree for the kids to climb. And I want to go to sleep every night with the same person by my side, and wake up next to him in the morning every morning for the rest of our lives. Just thought you should know that.",81,28467
28467,6,18,Lily ,You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora!,82,28468
28468,6,18,Barney ,"That's exactly what I want, too.",83,28469
28469,6,18,Nate ,"I'm really into gardening, but these squirrels keep messing with my tomatoes. Every time I see them in the backyard, I'm like, ""get out of here!"" And they run off, but sure enough, a few minutes later, there they are again. And I'm like, ""get out of here!"" So annoying. I smell food. Does this place have a kitchen? I'll be right back.",84,28470
28470,6,18,Robin ," Okay, but you have to admit that he is a lot of fun.",85,28471
28471,6,18,Marshall ,"Oh, I actually think he's quite intelligent for what he is.",86,28472
28472,6,18,Robin , And what is he?,87,28473
28473,6,18,Marshall ,He's a dog.,88,28474
28474,6,18,Ted ,He's totally a dog.,89,28475
28475,6,18,Robin , What? You saw him hitting on someone?,90,28476
28476,6,18,Marshall ,"No, I didn't say, ""He a dawg."" I said, ""He's a dog."" As in, a dog. I think we've all noticed a few curious mannerisms. Or rather, doggerisms.",91,28477
28477,6,18,Ted ,"Uh, Scooby, the tag's still on your jeans.",92,28478
28478,6,18,Nate ,Where?,93,28479

28482,6,18,Marshall ,"Okay, you're right. He dropped it.",97,28483
28483,6,18,Robin , He's not a dog.,98,28484
28484,6,18,Ted ,"Robin, it's fine. You said you wanted a dog and you got one. And the best part is, he got his shots.",99,28485
28485,6,18,Nate ,"Hey, guys, got my shots.",100,28486
28486,6,18,Marshall ,You are so playful.,101,28487
28487,6,18,Ted ,Nice job fetching those.,102,28488
28488,6,18,Lily ,"Yeah, guys, cut it out. Scooby, sit.",103,28489
28489,6,18,Marshall ,"So, Scooby, we were thinking if you're going to be hanging out with our Robin, you should be properly vetted.",104,28490
28490,6,18,Ted ,"Uh, yeah. We hope our nosiness doesn't give you ""paws.""",105,28491

28494,6,18,Lily ,"Did you send her an e-mail, or did you ""collar""?",109,28495
28495,6,18,Robin ," Guys, just stop hounding him. Oh, geez.",110,28496
28496,6,18,Marshall ,"No, no, you're right, Robin. We don't want your new guy to ""flea.""",111,28497
28497,6,18,Lily ,We're just trying to make sure he's not a heel.,112,28498
28498,6,18,Ted ,"So, moving from Canada, that transition must have been pretty ""ruff.""",113,28499
28499,6,18,Nate ,Sure was. My part of Canada's pretty different from New York.,114,28500
28500,6,18,Lily ,"Oh, I bet it was an ""Incredible Journey""""",115,28501
28501,6,18,Marshall ,What part of Canada is that? Speak.,116,28502
28502,6,18,Nate ,Labrador.,117,28503
28503,6,18,Lily ,This isn't happening.,118,28504

28508,6,18,Barney ,"Hey, guys, this is Nora.",123,28509
28509,6,18,Nora ,"We were just passing by, and I wanted to pop in for two reasons. First, I wanted to let you know that your friend Barney is being a perfect gentleman.",124,28510
28510,6,18,Robin ," Well, it's still early.",125,28511
28511,6,18,Nora ,"I'm being serious. I had no idea that deep down, he's such a romantic.",126,28512
28512,6,18,Lily ,I had no idea he had a deep down.,127,28513
28513,6,18,Nora ,"Oh, you should have heard him at dinner.",128,28514
28514,6,18,Barney ,"I mean, I like being single, but secretly, I want to have kids.",129,28515
28515,6,18,Nora ,How many do you want?,130,28516
28516,6,18,Barney ,Three... one of each. You?,131,28517
28517,6,18,Nora ,Three. All in an old stone house.,132,28518
28518,6,18,Barney ,"Yeah, with ivy growing on it.",133,28519
28519,6,18,Barney ,And we must have a pool.,134,28520

28522,6,18,Robin ,Unbelievable.,137,28523

28529,6,18,Marshall ,"Just make sure it's not a high-frequency whistle, because we don't want to torture Robin's boyfriend.",144,28530
28530,6,18,Barney ,"Guys, this is real. And if you don't make me look good in front of Nora, just remember: I've got dirt on each of you, and I am not afraid to spill it.",145,28531
28531,6,18,Lily ,"Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora.",146,28532
28532,6,18,Barney ,"Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know... your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig?",147,28533

28553,6,18,Nora ,So. How do you all know Barney?,168,28554

28562,6,18,Marshall ,"Okay, I think that we're done here, I think that we have adequately established that Barney is... the kind of guy that you would bring home to meet your parents. Okay? So... let's just drop it, all right?",177,28563
28563,6,18,Nora ,"It's funny you should say that, because, as it happens, my parents are in town. They're only here like once a year. We're getting brunch tomorrow. Do you want to meet them?",178,28564
28564,6,18,,Ted from 2030: This was a big deal for Barney.,179,28565

28586,6,18,Marshall ,"Okay, I'll tell you. Okay. One time Barney saw me drop a calzone on the sidewalk, pick it up, and then keep eating it. It feels so good to finally say that out loud. I...",201,28587
28587,6,18,Ted ,Dude. Listen to me. You have nothing to be ashamed of. That calzone sounds amazing.,202,28588
28588,6,18,Lily ,"Guys, I found this on the floor.",203,28589
28589,6,18,Ted ,"Oh, my God. Scooby ate the whole tray. Wait. Where is he, anyway?",204,28590
28590,6,18,Lily ,Scooby got out!,205,28591
28591,6,18,Nora ,Here we are. I had a really great time tonight.,206,28592
28592,6,18,Barney ,"Yeah, me, too.",207,28593
28593,6,18,Nora ,Do you want to come upstairs?,208,28594
28594,6,18,Barney ,"I'd love to. (He kisses her) There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants.",209,28595
28595,6,18,Barney ,Can you believe...,210,28596
28596,6,18,Lily ,"Oh, my God! I found Scooby's wallet.",211,28597
28597,6,18,Marshall ,"Oh, no! That means the poor guy's out there with no identification.",212,28598
28598,6,18,,"Ted, on the phone with Robin:Robin! Hey. Hey, um, remember Scooby? Uh, well, he got out.",213,28599
28599,6,18,Robin ," ""Got out""? What do you mean?",214,28600
28600,6,18,Ted ,He just walked out of the apartment. Someone must've left the door open.,215,28601
28601,6,18,Marshall ,It wasn't me.,216,28602
28602,6,18,Lily ,Me neither. He must've figured out how to open it himself.,217,28603
28603,6,18,Ted ,He's so smart. We should get him on Letterman doing tricks.,218,28604
28604,6,18,Marshall ,I know Paul Schaffer's sandwich guy. This could happen.,219,28605
28605,6,18,Robin , Guys. Get yourselves together and start looking for Scooby. I'm on my way home.,220,28606
28606,6,18,Ted ,Wait wait! Robin. Can you pick up some calzones?,221,28607
28607,6,18,Barney ,"Wait... Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you.",222,28608
28608,6,18,Nora ,Misled? You lied to me! You had your friends lie to me!,223,28609
28609,6,18,Barney ,I was on the spot. This is your fault.,224,28610
28610,6,18,Nora ,My fault?,225,28611
28611,6,18,Barney ,"Yeah, with the whole ""I want to get married"" thing. You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship. This... isn't England.",226,28612
28612,6,18,Nora ,"Good-bye, Barney.",227,28613
28613,6,18,Ted ,Great idea.,228,28614
28614,6,18,Marshall ,"No, great idea!",229,28615
28615,6,18,Lily ,"Okay. If you were new in town and had just ingested an eighth of sandwich, where would you go?",230,28616
28616,6,18,Marshall ,Of course. Back to the pizza place!,231,28617
28617,6,18,Ted ,Yeah! Maybe that's where Scooby went.,232,28618
28618,6,18,Marshall ,Who's Scooby?,233,28619
28619,6,18,Robin ," Hey, have you seen Scooby?",234,28620
28620,6,18,Barney ,"Uh, yeah. Isn't that him taking a leak on that fire hydrant?",235,28621
28621,6,18,Marshall ,Scooby!,236,28622
28622,6,18,Nate ,"Oh, hey! It's my friends!",237,28623
28623,6,18,The cardiologist," And that explains 12:51 a.m. Okay. None of this suggests a systemic issue. Your heart's fine. With a healthy diet, you can live a long and happy life. If nobody stabs you.",238,28624
28624,6,18,Lily ,Day's not over.,239,28625
28625,6,18,Barney ,"Okay. Lily, I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down.",240,28626
28626,6,18,Lily ,"No, that wasn't the lie. The lie was when you told Nora you were lying. Because you weren't. You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do.",241,28627
28627,6,18,Barney ,"Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. 50 years from now, if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another... 32 years. I mean... Nora's great. She's wonderful. But...",242,28628
28628,6,18,Lily ,What time was your dinner reservation?,243,28629
28629,6,18,Barney ,Last night? 8:30.,244,28630
28630,6,18,The cardiologist, What did his heart do at 8:30? It... literally skipped a beat.,245,28631
28631,6,18,Lily ,"Your heart's talking to you, Barney. Do you have the guts to listen to it.",246,28632
28632,6,18,Barney ,I lied.,247,28633
28633,6,18,Nora ,Barney.,248,28634
28634,6,18,Barney ,"When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry.",249,28635
28635,6,18,Nora ,I'm confused.,250,28636
28636,6,18,Barney ,"So am I. This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but I know it's what I want. I want to be confused. With you.",251,28637
28637,6,18,Nora ,"Mom, Dad... this is Barney.",252,28638
28638,6,18,Barney ,"Hi. I'm Barney. Great to meet you. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",253,28639
28639,6,19,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, I bought the house we live in now way back before I ever met your mother. It needed a lot of work, but I had a vision for it.",1,28640
28640,6,19,Ted ,"Vintage rolltop desk here. I haven't decided whether to put the fern on the right or the left side, but you know, sometimes you just gotta wing it. Right? Left side. Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids.",2,28641
28641,6,19,Barney ,"Ted. This is your seduction lounge. s*x swing there, vibrating Jell-O pit right there, rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel right here. Don't ask; you're not ready. And that basketball hoop? Outdoor stripper pole. We'll just tell the ladies to be careful in the winter. You think a tongue stuck to a frozen pole is bad...",3,28642
28642,6,19,Marshall ,"Hey. Barney, let's go outside for a second.",4,28643
28643,6,19,Lily , We have a confession. This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house. It's an intervention.,5,28644
28644,6,19,Barney ,"Oh, thank God. I'll go first. Ted, this hous you bought for your hypothetical family is super weird. We talk about it all the time behind your back.",6,28645
28645,6,19,Ted ,Yeah. This intervention isn't for me. It's for you,7,28646
28646,6,19,,Ted from 2030: Why did Barney need an intervention? It all started a few nights earlier.,8,28647
28647,6,19,Marshall ,"Barney, I can't believe your giant TV is broken. It's March Madness.",9,28648
28648,6,19,Ted ,"Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver?",10,28649
28649,6,19,Barney ,"Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks.",11,28650
28650,6,19,Lily , You call the super for a screwdriver?,12,28651
28651,6,19,Barney ,"Yeah... here's the thing about me and tools... the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again.",13,28652
28652,6,19,Ted ,"Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools.",14,28653
28653,6,19,Barney ,"Well, here's our screwdriver now. (Barney opens the door, then whispers loudly:) Guys, I'm pretty sure that's not Luis, but I can't be certain. Someone introduce yourself.",15,28654
28654,6,19,Jerry ,"Barney, I... I got your letter.",16,28655
28655,6,19,Barney ,Dad?,17,28656
28656,6,19,Marshall ,I can't believe Barney is talking to his dad right now.,18,28657
28657,6,19,Robin ,"Yeah, what do you say after three decades of not seeing each other?",19,28658
28658,6,19,Lily ," ""So, how 'bout those last 30 Super Bowls""?",20,28659
28659,6,19,Ted ,"Okay, now I feel bad about making fun of him for the tool thing. My dad was the one who taught me all that stuff.",21,28660
28660,6,19,Robin ,"Well, to be fair, everyone has some glaring gap in knowledge, something really obvious you somehow never learned.",22,28661
28661,6,19,Ted ,"Okay, but a screwdriver? Come on, I don't have any gaps that fundamental.",23,28662
28662,6,19,Robin ,Really? I seem to recall...,24,28663
28663,6,19,Ted ,Daniel Burnham was an architect whose ever-shifting style and aesthetic made him a true architectural chamma-leeon. And only the most gifted chamma-leeon could've designed classic beaux arts masterpieces right alongside sleek modern flatirons. His name might as well have been Daniel Chamma-leeon.,25,28664
28664,6,19,Student ,"Um, Professor? Uh, do you mean ""chameleon""?",26,28665
28665,6,19,Ted ,"Betty, I'm pretty sure it's pronounced ""chamma-leeon,"" so... Class dismissed. No homework. For a while.",27,28666
28666,6,19,Ted ,"Okay, I learned that word by reading it. That's how I've always pronounced it.",28,28667
28667,6,19,Robin ,"Ted, that wasn't easy. It took a lot of ""ch-aracter"" to admit that.",29,28668
28668,6,19,Ted ,"Okay, Scherbatsky. You want to tussle? I'll tussle.",30,28669
28669,6,19,Robin ,You want to tussle? Let's tussle.,31,28670
28670,6,19,Ted ,Marine biologist.,32,28671
28671,6,19,Robin ,"Please, no.",33,28672
28672,6,19,Scott ,"So this really sucks, but I'm going to be in the North Pole for the next three months.",34,28673
28673,6,19,Robin ,"Seriously? The North Pole? Okay, pal, if you want to break up with me, just tell it to me straight. Don't pretend you're going someplace we all know doesn't exist.",35,28674
28674,6,19,Scott ,"Um, I'm going to be studying the mating habits of...",36,28675
28675,6,19,Robin ,"Of who? Santa's elves? Rudolph? You know what? I'm going on a trip, too, Scott. It, uh, starts in Narnia. It works its way up to Candyland, and then, hey, congratulate me, because I'm the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Expelliarmus!",37,28676
28676,6,19,Scott ,"Robin, the North Pole is a real place. You know that, right?",38,28677
28677,6,19,Robin ,So... you want to get pizza later? Or...,39,28678
28678,6,19,Scott ,I think we should break up.,40,28679
28679,6,19,Robin ,I still think about him in the shower.,41,28680
28680,6,19,Ted ,"Hey. Tell us everything. How'd it go, bud?",42,28681
28681,6,19,Barney ,Where do I begin?,43,28682
28682,6,19,,"Jerry (Barney's dad): So, I'm not sure how to start this.",44,28683
28683,6,19,Barney ,Yeah. I think I need a drink.,45,28684
28684,6,19,Jerry ,"Me, too.",46,28685
28685,6,19,Both ,"Glen McKenna, neat.",47,28686
28686,6,19,Jerry ,Nice order. Up top.,48,28687
28687,6,19,Barney ,"Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is... this is going to take me a minute.",49,28688
28688,6,19,Jerry ,"Yeah. I understand. By the way, hell of a tie. Is that Italian silk?",50,28689
28689,6,19,Barney ,"I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now.",51,28690
28690,6,19,Barney ,Make a muscle.,52,28691
28691,6,19,Jerry ,There you go.,53,28692
28692,6,19,Barney ,Ah!,54,28693
28693,6,19,Barney ,"Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out.",55,28694
28694,6,19,Barney ,"Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that?",56,28695
28695,6,19,Jerry ,"Not anymore. Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for The Stones through West Germany, and their tour manager loses his arms, bus-surfing through a tunnel. Gnarly. Long story short, I've been managing tours ever since, and that dude high-fives people with his face now.",57,28696
28696,6,19,,"Barney, laughing: You're funny. My dad's funny.",58,28697
28697,6,19,Barney ,"So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him.",59,28698
28698,6,19,Lily , Why did you abandon me?,60,28699
28699,6,19,Marshall ,Why'd you wait so long to contact me?,61,28700
28700,6,19,Robin ,"You've hurt me before, why should I trust you now?",62,28701
28701,6,19,Barney ,Do you... get laid a lot?,63,28702
28702,6,19,Jerry ,Big-time. Observe.,64,28703
28703,6,19,Barney ,"Oh, my God, that took you five seconds.",65,28704
28704,6,19,Jerry ,"Oh, was it that long? Life's too short for chatty chicks.",66,28705
28705,6,19,Barney ,You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...,67,28706
28706,6,19,,"Barney:...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream.",68,28707
28707,6,19,Jerry ,So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow with Bon Jovi. I'll be on the road the rest of the year.,69,28708
28708,6,19,Barney ,"Oh, that's cool.",70,28709
28709,6,19,Jerry ,"Say, you want to join me for the tour's Asian leg?",71,28710
28710,6,19,Barney ,This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg. (both laughing),72,28711
28711,6,19,Lily ," Barney, we... we know you're psyched, but just... be careful.",73,28712
28712,6,19,Barney ,What do you mean?,74,28713
28713,6,19,Ted ,"Well, this guy has flaked out on your whole life. It sounds like he just might be telling you what you want to hear.",75,28714
28714,6,19,Robin ,"Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt.",76,28715
28715,6,19,Barney ,"First of all, Robin, my dad could beat up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me... I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready.",77,28716
28716,6,19,Ted ,"I hope Barney's dad isn't just pretending to be something he's not, you know?",78,28717
28717,6,19,Lily , Yeah. That would make Jerry a real chamma-leeon.,79,28718
28718,6,19,Ted ,"You have gaps, too, Lily.",80,28719
28719,6,19,Lily , You got nothing on me.,81,28720
28720,6,19,Marshall ,"Hey, Lily, can you toss me a beer?",82,28721
28721,6,19,Lily ," Sure, honey. (She throws the key toward the wall besides Marshall)",83,28722
28722,6,19,Ted ,You have terrible aim.,84,28723
28723,6,19,Lily , That's not true.,85,28724
28724,6,19,Marshall ,"Lily, at our apartment, you're the one who pees on the floor.",86,28725
28725,6,19,Robin ,"Oh, my God. Barney's dad.",87,28726
28726,6,19,Jerry ,"Hey, uh, you're Barney's friends, right?",88,28727
28727,6,19,Marshall ,"Yeah, but... aren't you supposed to be off managing some tour in Australia?",89,28728
28728,6,19,Jerry ,"What? No, I... I'm a driving instructor up in White Plains. And I need your help... Barney won't return my calls.",90,28729
28729,6,19,Lily ," What do you mean, Barney won't return your calls? He said you two had an amazing night together.",91,28730
28730,6,19,Jerry ,That's not what happened.,92,28731
28731,6,19,Barney ,I'm not sure how to start this.,93,28732
28732,6,19,Jerry ,Yeah.,94,28733
28733,6,19,Barney ,I think I need a drink.,95,28734
28734,6,19,Jerry ,"Me, too.",96,28735
28735,6,19,Barney ,"Glen McKenna, neat.",97,28736
28736,6,19,Jerry ,"Milk, skim.",98,28737
28737,6,19,Barney ,"Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night?",99,28738
28738,6,19,Jerry ,"I'll say. Between you and me, I had a lot of acid last night.",100,28739
28739,6,19,Barney ,Wow.,101,28740
28740,6,19,Jerry ,"I think it was the chili dog. I had to take four Tums. I was up till, like, 9:30.",102,28741
28741,6,19,Barney ,"Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that?",103,28742
28742,6,19,Jerry ,"No. I switched lanes years ago. I should explain. I'm a driving instructor. Now you get it, right",104,28743
28743,6,19,Barney ,"Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass.",105,28744
28744,6,19,Jerry ,"Oh, I know. I was a real hard partier.",106,28745
28745,6,19,Barney ,"Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff.",107,28746
28746,6,19,Jerry ,"The drugs, the alcohol, the women...",108,28747
28747,6,19,Barney ,"Yes, yes, yes.",109,28748
28748,6,19,Jerry ,I was out of control.,110,28749
28749,6,19,Barney ,*Out of control.*,111,28750
28750,6,19,Jerry ,"So when your mom said I couldn't see you any more, it was rock bottom for me. I'm so sorry.",112,28751
28751,6,19,Barney ,You ever bang Stevie Nicks?,113,28752
28752,6,19,Jerry ,Barney wasn't interested in my apology. He just wanted me to be cool. And I was so desperate to connect with him. I did something I'm not proud of. I started bragging.,114,28753
28753,6,19,Jerry ,"I bet you didn't know this about me, Barney, but I've published two nonfiction books about asparagus. And one fiction. I'm credited with inventing the word ""furgling."" It means fumbling for keys. So then all the county fair judges started chanting, ""More quiche! More quiche!"" I guess you could call me the LeBron James of drapes.",115,28754
28754,6,19,Jerry ,"I could tell he just wanted me to be this big ladies' man, so...",116,28755
28755,6,19,Jerry ,"What a hottie, huh? I'm sure you're a real player.",117,28756
28756,6,19,Barney ,Big-time.,118,28757
28757,6,19,Jerry ,"Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate.",119,28758
28758,6,19,Barney ,"Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the ""Father Knows Breast,"" there's the ""Bush Dynasty,"" the ""Lick Father, Lick Son.""",120,28759
28759,6,19,Jerry ,"Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that.",121,28760
28760,6,19,Barney ,Why?,122,28761
28761,6,19,Jerry ,"I have a family now. That's my wife Cheryl, my daughter Carly... she's in college. This is my son J.J. I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them.",123,28762
28762,6,19,Barney ,"You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this.",124,28763
28763,6,19,Jerry ,"I made him wait all these years for me and... I'm just not the guy he wanted me to be. I know I don't deserve it, but... I need another chance to connect with my son.",125,28764
28764,6,19,Lily , We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.,126,28765
28765,6,19,Barney ,What?,127,28766
28766,6,19,Marshall ,You're having dinner with him tonight.,128,28767
28767,6,19,Barney ,"No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that.",129,28768
28768,6,19,Robin ,Are you sure it's not more than that?,130,28769
28769,6,19,Barney ,"Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again.",131,28770
28770,6,19,Marshall ,"No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road.",132,28771
28771,6,19,Barney ,"Fine, I'll go.",133,28772
28772,6,19,Marshall ,"Awesome. Um, Lily, keys. (She throws them way too hard, they land in the trees) I'm literally 11 inches from you.",134,28773
28773,6,19,,Ted from 2030: And so Barney agreed to give his dad one more chance.,135,28774
28774,6,19,Cherryl ,Hello. You must be Barney. I'm Cheryl. It's just so nice to finally meet you. I love that suit.,136,28775

28779,6,19,Marshall ,"Hey, I got an idea how to pass the time. A little trivia game. Robin, reindeer: real or fake?",141,28780
28780,6,19,Robin ,"Okay, I'm not an idiot. Reindeer are obviously f... re... fake?",142,28781
28781,6,19,Marshall ,"Yikes! I'm surrounded by a bunch of dum-dums. Good thing I don't have any gaps in my knowledge. I am perfect. Oh, for the love of God, guys, enough already.",143,28782

28787,6,19,Marshall ,I first noticed it at the bar.,149,28788
28788,6,19,Marshall ,"Hey, Lily, (his voice cracks) Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys. [...] The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie.",150,28789
28789,6,19,Barney ,"It ages well, that's the thing.",151,28790
28790,6,19,Marshall ,You guys like my new soul patch?,152,28791

28792,6,19,Marshall ,"And once I figured it out, I started doing crazy stuff to see how far you'd let me go. [...]Hey, guys. This is Rex. He's a possum. I found him in the trash. He lives with us now.",154,28793
28793,6,19,Lily , I love him.,155,28794
28794,6,19,Marshall ,"Lily, we are living with a possum. Rex is violent and he hates us.",156,28795

28796,6,19,Marshall ,"Please. If you guys really want me to get over the worst tragedy of my life, I'm begging you, tear me a new one. But not like Rex tried to in my sleep last night.",158,28797
28797,6,19,Jerry ,"J.J., dinner. When I got your letter, I dug this up. You were probably too young to remember, but this is you, this is me, and, of course, ZZ Top.",159,28798
28798,6,19,Barney ,I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas.,160,28799

28803,6,19,Ted ,"Well, I guess maybe one gap you have is... you can't wink.",165,28804
28804,6,19,Marshall ,"Don't you think that maybe we should go home and, uh, ""do the laundry""",166,28805

28831,6,19,Marshall ,It's like I'm blind.,193,28832

28834,6,19,Lily ," Aw, honey.",196,28835
28835,6,19,Marshall ,"No, I'm just kidding. This is great. I really, I really missed this.",197,28836
28836,6,19,Jerry ,"Barney, what is going on?",198,28837
28837,6,19,Barney ,This is mine.,199,28838
28838,6,19,Jerry ,I don't understand.,200,28839
28839,6,19,Barney ,"J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me.",201,28840
28840,6,19,Jerry ,"Please, just come down and talk to me.",202,28841
28841,6,19,Barney ,"Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad.",203,28842
28842,6,19,Jerry ,Why does that make you so mad?,204,28843
28843,6,19,Barney ,"Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?!",205,28844
28844,6,19,Jerry ,"Look, Barney, I know I screwed up...",206,28845
28845,6,19,Barney ,"Oh, ""screwed up"" doesn't even begin to describe...",207,28846
28846,6,19,Jerry ,"I know, I know, I know! I want to fix this, and I don't know how! Please, tell me what I can do! I'll do anything! You're never gonna get it down like that. Barney. Barney! Just put the pointy end into the grooves. That's it. Now turn it. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. I have no good excuse, Barney. It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down. It took courage to send me that letter. More courage than I've ever had. I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I... I just have no idea where to begin.",208,28847
28847,6,19,Barney ,Can you help me with this?,209,28848

28852,6,19,Ted ,"Yeah, buddy.",214,28853
28853,6,19,Barney ,"You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there?",215,28854
28854,6,19,Ted ,"Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine.",216,28855
28855,6,19,Barney ,"No, you were right. A kid needs a hoop.",217,28856
28856,6,20,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, as you know, I was designing Goliath National Bank's new headquarters on the site of this old hotel, The Arcadian. Problem was, some people didn't want The Arcadian torn down. Even bigger problem, they were led by my girlfriend Zoey.",1,28857
28857,6,20,Crowd ,G-N-B is the e-ne-my!,2,28858
28858,6,20,Zoey ,"(She sees Ted at the window) Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on! Hey, sweetie! Are we still on for dinner at 8:00 at Valenzisi's? That's great! I can't wait!",3,28859

28860,6,20,,"Ted from 2030: But somehow, Zoey and I were making it work.",5,28861
28861,6,20,Barney ,"Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner.",6,28862
28862,6,20,Robin ,Or maybe he was. Think about it. The way that she bats her eyelashes and shakes her tail feathers in his face? (chuckles) She wants it.,7,28863
28863,6,20,Lily ,Isn't it hard for you guys to be on opposite sides of something like this?,8,28864
28864,6,20,Ted ,"Of course you feel that way, Lily. You and Marshall have basically melded into one big hermaphroditic blob. And that's fine for you guys. But some of us want a partner who challenges us to grow and evolve.",9,28865
28865,6,20,Lily ,You guys are in screaming matches all the time.,10,28866
28866,6,20,Ted ,"Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Growing matches.",11,28867
28867,6,20,,Ted from 2030: It was true. Zoey and I loved to challenge each other.,12,28868
28868,6,20,Ted ,The main character is a young spoiled prince thrust into leadership after the death of his father. It's obviously a modern-day retelling of Henry IV!,13,28869
28869,6,20,,Zoey:Are you kidding me?! It's Don Quixote...the classic quest story with the hero-jester and his long-suffering manservant!,14,28870

28885,6,20,Lily ,"Marshall and I have been together 15 years, and the only debate we've had about Tommy Boy is whether it's awesome or super awesome. That's love, bitch.",30,28886
28886,6,20,,"Ted from 2030: Now around this time, Marshall had truly come to hate his job. He hated the paperwork. He hated the coffee. He hated the dirty jokes. He hated everything.",31,28887
28887,6,20,Marshall ,I have to quit.,32,28888
28888,6,20,Barney ,Quit GNB?! Why?,33,28889
28889,6,20,Marshall ,"I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species...",34,28890
28890,6,20,Barney ,"Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.",35,28891
28891,6,20,Lily ,"Baby, you have my full support.",36,28892
28892,6,20,Barney ,"Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning. (Barney snickers) Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids.",37,28893

28897,6,20,,"Ted from 2030: So Marshall walked in the next morning all ready to quit. But then something weird happened. Suddenly, he didn't hate the paperwork. He didn't hate the coffee. He didn't even hate the dirty jokes. Out of nowhere, Marshall actually liked GNB.",42,28898
28898,6,20,Robin ,It's graduation goggles.,43,28899
28899,6,20,Marshall ,What?,44,28900
28900,6,20,,"Robin:Graduation goggles, like with high school. It's four years of bullies making fun of all the kids with braces, even after the braces come off and they can walk just fine. But then, on graduation day, you suddenly get all misty because you realize you're never going to see those jerks again. I just had graduation goggles with that guy Scooby I dated.",45,28901
28901,6,20,Lily ,The guy who was basically a dog?,46,28902

28904,6,20,,"Robin:The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer.",49,28905
28905,6,20,Marshall ,"You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.",50,28906
28906,6,20,Barney ,"No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!",51,28907

28911,6,20,Girl ,How can you not remember my name?,56,28912
28912,6,20,Ted ,It's like they never challenge each other. They just automatically agree all the time.,57,28913

28921,6,20,Lily ,"Oh, good for you, sweetie.",66,28922
28922,6,20,Marshall ,"Yeah. It's a little less money than I was expecting. I mean, compared to what I was making at GNB, it's nothing. Actually compared to anything, it's nothing. It's nothing. The paid position just got filled, so all I can do is-is volunteer right now. You're cool with that, right?",67,28923
28923,6,20,Lily ,"Baby, if this is what you need to do, we'll figure it out. How's Barney handling you leaving?",68,28924
28924,6,20,Ted ,"Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play ""Who's Hot and Who's Scott?""",69,28925

28929,6,20,Man ,"Your girlfriend somehow got the Landmark Preservation Committee to agree to a hearing. If they declare the Arcadian a landmark, the whole project is dead. The good news is, I just got the phone number of a husky-voiced hottie in a turtleneck.",74,28930

28931,6,20,Ted ,I'm furiously enjoying being challenged.,76,28932
28932,6,20,Lily ,Why don't you admit that your girlfriend challenging your every move is getting you a little murder-suicidey?,77,28933
28933,6,20,Ted ,Why don't you admit that Marshall quitting his job and taking an unpaid internship is killing you?,78,28934
28934,6,20,Lily ,It's not.,79,28935
28935,6,20,Ted ,"Lily, the downside to having giant, Japanese anime eyes is that they're easy to read. And yours are screaming, ""What about my trip to Spain, deadbeat?""",80,28936
28936,6,20,Lily ,"Okay, Ted, the downside to having a woman's mouth is, your feminine pout gives away your true feelings. And yours is saying, ""Oh, Zoey, why can't I be on top just this once?""",81,28937
28937,6,20,Ted ,We take turns! Sometimes.,82,28938
28938,6,20,Marshall ,"Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC.",83,28939

28957,6,20,Lily ,"Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right? (Ted says something in spanish) Perfect. Let's go.",102,28958
28958,6,20,Barney ,"Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?",103,28959
28959,6,20,Marshall ,"Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't.",104,28960
28960,6,20,Barney ,"Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time.",105,28961
28961,6,20,Robin ,"(Robin is standing at the door) Oh, my God!",106,28962
28962,6,20,Barney ,How long have you been there?,107,28963
28963,6,20,Robin ,You don't remember?,108,28964
28964,6,20,Robin ,"Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.",109,28965
28965,6,20,Barney ,"Oh, no, I'm fine.",110,28966
28966,6,20,Robin ,"Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?",111,28967
28967,6,20,,"Barney:Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?",112,28968
28968,6,20,Robin ,Yeah.,113,28969
28969,6,20,,"Barney:Right. So, um... Chinese?",114,28970
28970,6,20,Ted ,"You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Marshall doesn't make us a worse couple.",115,28971
28971,6,20,Lily ,"You're right. I-If you and Zoey are happy, then who am I to judge? I'm so sorry.",116,28972
28972,6,20,Ted ,"Oh, my God, is that how support feels? It's so warm and wonderful. Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy.",117,28973
28973,6,20,Lily ,But I thought you liked being challenged.,118,28974
28974,6,20,Ted ,"Nobody likes being challenged! Couldn't she agree with me just once, even on something little, like... like what movie to see or-or what topping to get on our pizza or... oh, I don't know, my lifelong dream of building a skyscraper in New York City?!",119,28975
28975,6,20,Lily ,"Well, in her defense, hamburger pizza, Ted? What are you, 12?",120,28976
28976,6,20,Ted ,"You were right, Lily. I mean, Zoey's great, but... sometimes I do wish we were a little more like you and Marshall. There he is. Here we go. (Ted says some incomprehensible things in spanish)",121,28977
28977,6,20,Man ,I'm sorry. I don't speak... whatever it is you're speaking.,122,28978
28978,6,20,Ted ,"Um, he speaks perfect English.",123,28979
28979,6,20,Lily ,"Yeah, I-I know.",124,28980
28980,6,20,Ted ,Then why did you ask me to come?,125,28981
28981,6,20,Lily ,"So you can drive him to the fund-raiser. Supporting Marshall this much is driving me crazy. I'm going to Spain-- my flight leaves in 45 minutes. Adios, muchacho.",126,28982
28982,6,20,Ted ,"W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain?",127,28983
28983,6,20,Lily ,"You were right. If I hear myself say ""Baby, you have my full support"" one more time, I swear I'm gonna m*rder someone!",128,28984
28984,6,20,Ted ,"What are you gonna tell Marshall, huh? And when are you coming back?",129,28985
28985,6,20,Lily ,"I honestly haven't thought it all the way through, and I don't intend to. All I know is that I'm a ticking time b*mb, and if I don't do something for me right away, I swear I'm gonna explode!",130,28986
28986,6,20,Ted ,"Wow, tha... that's an evocative metaphor to use for your nonthreatening, totally patriotic emotions. U.S.A.! Okay, Lily, I get it.",131,28987
28987,6,20,Lily ,Marshall's been asking a lot lately.,132,28988
28988,6,20,Ted ,But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough.,133,28989
28989,6,20,Lily ,"I've never been good at that. And now, ever since his dad died, I-I feel like it's my job to just be fine with everything. But I'm not. I'm not fine that he volunteers our apartment for a giant fund-raiser and that he's not thinking about how we're gonna pay any of our bills and that, apparently, we've given up on trying to have kids.",134,28990
28990,6,20,Ted ,Lil...,135,28991
28991,6,20,Lily ,"Look, I'm sorry, Ted, I just, I gotta do this. (Lily leaves)",136,28992
28992,6,20,Man ,"My bag? Oh, no. I got it.",137,28993
28993,6,20,Barney ,There's nothing to talk about.,138,28994
28994,6,20,Robin ,"You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.",139,28995
28995,6,20,Barney ,"I don't want to talk about it, okay?",140,28996
28996,6,20,Robin ,Why not?,141,28997
28997,6,20,Barney ,Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.,142,28998
28998,6,20,Robin ,"I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... (quietly): ticking.",143,28999
28999,6,20,Barney ,That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?,144,29000
29000,6,20,Robin ,"No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.",145,29001
29001,6,20,Barney ,Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.,146,29002
29002,6,20,Robin ,Huh?,147,29003
29003,6,20,Barney ,It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.,148,29004
29004,6,20,Barney ,"Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.",149,29005
29005,6,20,Marshall ,"Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.",150,29006
29006,6,20,Barney ,"I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...",151,29007
29007,6,20,,"Barney:...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted. (quiet sobbing) You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?",152,29008
29008,6,20,Robin ,What is wrong with you?,153,29009
29009,6,20,Marshall ,"Hey, Professor Rodriguez, thank you so much for coming.",154,29010
29010,6,20,,"Prof. Rodriguez: Oh, my pleasure. I have to use the restroom. Do you have some extra invitations?",155,29011
29011,6,20,Marshall ,"Right over there. Enjoy. Hey. Hey, thanks for picking him up.",156,29012
29012,6,20,Ted ,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, listen, something happened at the airport. Um...",157,29013
29013,6,20,Marshall ,What?,158,29014
29014,6,20,Ted ,"Well, we got there, and, uh, Lily...(sighs) Lily...",159,29015
29015,6,20,Lily ,"Marshall, hey. Sorry, I, uh, I had to park and-and grab some ice. Sorry.",160,29016
29016,6,20,Marshall ,"Oh, thanks, babe. You would not believe how much this one has done to help throw this party, Ted. I don't know how she does it. Can't be easy, huh, Lil?",161,29017
29017,6,20,Lily ,"Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I-I need to talk to you about something.",162,29018
29018,6,20,Marshall ,"No, you know what? Me, too. Um... I want to thank you for being so supportive of me in all this. I've been at the NRDC for less than a week, and I've already done more to be proud of than in two years at GNB. I can't believe how good it feels. But now, it's time for me to find a way to help the Earth and get paid for it, because I can't put that burden entirely on you. So, starting tomorrow, I'll look for something with a paycheck. What do you think?",163,29019
29019,6,20,Lily ,"Baby, you have my full support.",164,29020
29020,6,20,Zoey ,Ted.,165,29021
29021,6,20,Ted ,Hey! What are you doing here?,166,29022
29022,6,20,Zoey ,"This is really important to Marshall, so I came to show my support.",167,29023
29023,6,20,Ted ,This you can be supportive of?!,168,29024
29024,6,20,Zoey ,What is that supposed to mean?,169,29025
29025,6,20,Ted ,"I have the chance to build a skyscraper in the best city on Earth, and who's the one leading the charge to k*ll that dream? My girlfriend!",170,29026
29026,6,20,Zoey ,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about my lifelong dream of not seeing every beautiful building in Manhattan bulldozed?",171,29027
29027,6,20,,"Ted from 2030: And in that moment, I realized, though I really cared about Zoey, I couldn't do this for the next 50 years. I had to break up with her. But then... Kids, some couples always support each other, and some couples always challenge each other, but is one really better than the other? Yes. Support is better. Way better. But I'd have to learn that the hard way.",172,29028
29028,6,20,Lily ,You're too young. This isn't fair.,173,29029
29029,6,20,Marshall ,"We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end.",174,29030
29030,6,20,,"Barney, weakly: Thank you, Marshall. (coughs weakly) Marshall... can I ask one final favor, my friend?",175,29031
29031,6,20,Marshall ,"Yes, of course, of course... anything.",176,29032
29032,6,20,Barney ,Eat this meatball sub.,177,29033
29033,6,20,Marshall ,Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...,178,29034
29034,6,20,Barney ,I don't have much time!,179,29035
29035,6,20,Marshall ,"Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?",180,29036
29036,6,20,,"Barney, with a mean laugh: I'm not sick, you idiots! I've racked up $30,000 of uninsured medical bills for symptoms I don't even have. Totally worth it! You should see the look on your face. Oh, wait, you can't-- 'cause it's covered in marinara sauce!",181,29037
29037,6,20,Ted ,"Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas.",182,29038
29038,6,21,Jerry ,"Barney, afraid this is good-bye. Your buzz k*ll of a ma... thinks I'm a... a bad influence on you.",1,29039
29039,6,21,Barney ,"What? That's... What is that word you taught me? ""Bull"" something?",2,29040
29040,6,21,Jerry ,"But she's your mother and I'm... you know, I'm just your Uncle Jerry. So, this is the last time I can see you.",3,29041
29041,6,21,Barney ,But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be... Led-and-Jerry.,4,29042
29042,6,21,Jerry ,"Sorry, buddy, but this is it. But don't you forget your training. What's a magician's best friend?",5,29043
29043,6,21,Barney ,A drunk audience.,6,29044
29044,6,21,,"Jerry, laughing: Attaboy. You still got that button from the festival we went to? Now... I'm gonna put this right inside your brain, behind your ear... so that I'll know that you won't forget me. See you, buddy. And hey... Never... stop... partying.",7,29045
29045,6,21,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, in 1983, Barney watched his father walk out of his life. And in 2011, when their first reunion ended badly...",8,29046
29046,6,21,Jerry ,I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.,9,29047
29047,6,21,,Ted from 2030: This time it was Barney who did the walking.,10,29048
29048,6,21,Barney ,Bye.,11,29049
29049,6,21,,"Ted from 2030: And that was almost the end of it. Except, a few weeks later...",12,29050
29050,6,21,Barney ,"I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess.",13,29051
29051,6,21,Marshall ,Mmm. Your dad?,14,29052
29052,6,21,Barney ,My dad!,15,29053
29053,6,21,Barney ,Barney Stinson.,16,29054
29054,6,21,Jerry ,"Hi, Barney. It's your dad. Look, would you like to go fishing with me and J.J. on Sunday morning?",17,29055
29055,6,21,Barney ,"Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years.",18,29056
29056,6,21,Jerry ,"Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... ""Crazy Jerry""? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right?",19,29057
29057,6,21,Barney ,You do not know how right you are.,20,29058
29058,6,21,Barney ,Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything.,21,29059
29059,6,21,Ted ,"You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.",22,29060
29060,6,21,Barney ,"I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues.",23,29061
29061,6,21,Robin ,"Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.",24,29062
29062,6,21,,"Barney:Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?",25,29063
29063,6,21,Barney ,"Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.",26,29064
29064,6,21,Lily ,That's why you brought these guys.,27,29065
29065,6,21,,Barney:No. That's why I brought these guys. (He gets several cards out of his inside pocket) I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards.,28,29066
29066,6,21,Marshall ,Improvements?!,29,29067
29067,6,21,,Barney:Yeah.,30,29068
29068,6,21,Marshall ,"Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards.",31,29069
29069,6,21,,"Barney:Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage.",32,29070
29070,6,21,Lily ,Whoo-hoo!,33,29071
29071,6,21,Marshall ,Gross!,34,29072
29072,6,21,,"Barney:Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself. (chuckles) Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about.",35,29073
29073,6,21,Ted ,"Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, ""Man is least himself when he talks...""",36,29074
29074,6,21,,"Barney:Ted, card.",37,29075
29075,6,21,Ted ,"Ah. You're right... ""No quoting Oscar Wilde.""",38,29076
29076,6,21,,"Barney:Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted.",39,29077
29077,6,21,Robin ,"Aw, man! Why?",40,29078
29078,6,21,Barney ,"I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh... (chuckles) no, thanks.",41,29079
29079,6,21,Lily ,"Hey, Barney... love the new identities. Little thing... instead of being a naked super ninja, can I be Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada?",42,29080
29080,6,21,Ted ,How good was that movie?,43,29081
29081,6,21,Barney ,And... hence new identities.,44,29082
29082,6,21,,Ted from 2030: And so Barney's dad finally showed up.,45,29083
29083,6,21,Barney ,"Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer.",46,29084
29084,6,21,Marshall ,"Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet.",47,29085
29085,6,21,Barney ,"Lily, his wife.",48,29086
29086,6,21,Lily ,"Well, most nights. Mama don't let no ring get in the way of a good time.",49,29087
29087,6,21,Jerry ,That's... a little depressing.,50,29088
29088,6,21,Ted ,"Uh, hi again. Ted. Oh, and, Jerry, you remember my girlfriend.",51,29089
29089,6,21,Robin ,Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.,52,29090
29090,6,21,Barney ,"Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band.",53,29091
29091,6,21,ROBIN ,"Two, three, four!",54,29092
29092,6,21,Jerry ,"So, Saturday night... time to cut loose, right? Who wants to split a beer?",55,29093
29093,6,21,Barney ,"Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong...",56,29094
29094,6,21,Marshall ,"Um, those places shut down a long time ago.",57,29095
29095,6,21,Barney ,"Oh, no.",58,29096
29096,6,21,Marshall ,"Oh, No shut down, too.",59,29097
29097,6,21,Ted ,There's Where?,60,29098
29098,6,21,Jerry ,Where's Where?,61,29099
29099,6,21,Lily ,"Where's where Was was, isn't it?",62,29100
29100,6,21,Barney ,"No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right?",63,29101
29101,6,21,Jerry ,Okay.,64,29102
29102,6,21,Ted ,Not Okay. That place is lame.,65,29103
29103,6,21,Robin ,Okay is Lame? I thought Lame was a gay bar. Or is that Wrong?,66,29104
29104,6,21,Marshall ,That's wrong. That's not Wrong.,67,29105
29105,6,21,Barney ,"Guys, focus.",68,29106
29106,6,21,Robin ,"Oh, I like Focus. Let's go there.",69,29107
29107,6,21,Ted ,Where?,70,29108
29108,6,21,Robin ,Not Where. Focus.,71,29109
29109,6,21,Lily ,I thought Focus was closed.,72,29110
29110,6,21,Barney ,"No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed.",73,29111
29111,6,21,Marshall ,So Closed is open.,74,29112
29112,6,21,Robin ,"No, Closed is closed.",75,29113
29113,6,21,Jerry ,I don't know. Third base! Right?,76,29114
29114,6,21,Robin ,"Ew, Third Base is all frat guys.",77,29115
29115,6,21,Jerry ,"I'll go anyplace, okay?",78,29116
29116,6,21,Ted ,Not Okay. Okay is lame.,79,29117
29117,6,21,Robin ,Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar.,80,29118
29118,6,21,Lily ,"Guys, shut up.",81,29119
29119,6,21,Barney ,"No, Shut up shut down. I can't believe I don't know the clubs anymore.",82,29120
29120,6,21,Marshall ,"Guys, just pick a club, okay?",83,29121
29121,6,21,Ted ,Not Okay!,84,29122
29122,6,21,All ,Okay is Lame! Gay bar.,85,29123
29123,6,21,Marshall ,"For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Lamé.",86,29124
29124,6,21,Barney ,"It's hopeless, isn't it?",87,29125
29125,6,21,Marshall ,Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters.,88,29126
29126,6,21,Barney ,I know. Daddy's home. And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard!,89,29127
29127,6,21,Jerry ,I might be allergic to this stamp.,90,29128
29128,6,21,Robin ,"Oh, my God, my secret crush is here.",91,29129
29129,6,21,Lily ,Mila Kunis?!,92,29130
29130,6,21,Robin ,"No, my secret crush. We met a few years ago.",93,29131
29131,6,21,Man ,Hi. I could use a woman's opinion. Is this working for me?,94,29132
29132,6,21,Robin ,"Uh... no. (laughs) The only good thing about how ugly that shirt is, is that it distracts from how terribly it fits you.",95,29133
29133,6,21,Man ,I was trying on the pants.,96,29134
29134,6,21,Robin ,Oh. (Laughs),97,29135
29135,6,21,Robin ,"I had to leave before we could finish talking, so that was it. You know, ever since then, I've always... Oh, my God, he's coming over here. Oh. Hello.",98,29136
29136,6,21,Man ,Hi. A few years ago at a department store... did you embarrass the hell out of me?,99,29137
29137,6,21,Robin ,"Oh, I'm sorry, you must have me confused with the shirt you were wearing that day.",100,29138
29138,6,21,Man ,I should be so lucky.,101,29139
29139,6,21,Ted ,Hi! I'm Ted! Robin's boyfriend! Nice to meet you.,102,29140
29140,6,21,Man ,Right. Um... it was really nice to see you again.,103,29141
29141,6,21,Robin ,"Mm-hmm. You, too.",104,29142
29142,6,21,Man ,Yeah.,105,29143
29143,6,21,,"Ted, whispering to Robin: You owe me one.",106,29144
29144,6,21,Barney ,"Man, isn't this place great?",107,29145
29145,6,21,Jerry ,"Uh, I don't know. It's so loud!",108,29146
29146,6,21,Marshall ,And so bourgeois. Many of plays are about the bourgeois. And ennui. And one rock opera about... a frozen yogurt shop.,109,29147
29147,6,21,Barney ,"Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk about your open marriage.",110,29148
29148,6,21,Lily ,"Okay. Well, after a long day of style meetings and photo shoots and being way too mean to my assistant, I sometimes bang an underwear model.",111,29149
29149,6,21,Jerry ,My goodness!,112,29150
29150,6,21,Marshall ,"I sleep around, too. Just as much. A little more, even.",113,29151
29151,6,21,Lily ,"Oh, uh, only 'cause you have nothing to do all day.",114,29152
29152,6,21,Marshall ,Are we having this fight again? Writing plays is a real job!,115,29153
29153,6,21,Lily ,"I work 90 hours a week subsidizing your ""real job.""",116,29154
29154,6,21,Marshall ,I won a Tony!,117,29155
29155,6,21,Lily ,I brought French cooking to America!,118,29156
29156,6,21,Marshall ,What?,119,29157
29157,6,21,Barney ,Let's do shots.,120,29158
29158,6,21,Jerry ,"Uh, no, thank you, Barney. I have that fishing trip with J.J. early tomorrow. I... I better take it easy.",121,29159
29159,6,21,Barney ,"No. Don't you remember what you said to me when I was a kid? ""Never stop partying.""",122,29160
29160,6,21,,"Jerry, looking horrified: I said that? To a six-year-old? I don't remember that.",123,29161
29161,6,21,Barney ,"You don't remember the last thing you said to me when I was a kid? Well... you know, why don't you just go back home?",124,29162
29162,6,21,Jerry ,But I want to hang out with you.,125,29163
29163,6,21,Barney ,"Yeah, well, I want to hang out with Crazy Jerry, not Stay-at-Home Jerome.",126,29164
29164,6,21,Jerry ,Fine. You want Crazy Jerry? (He drinks four shots) There! You got him! I apologize... it might take a few minutes to kick in.,127,29165
29165,6,21,All ,Oh...,128,29166
29166,6,21,Jerry ,"Hey, sugar! Five beers for the table, a Seven-and-Seven for me, and your ten digits for this guy here! Tonight Crazy Jerry's gonna burn this disco down! Whoo! Wa-hah!",129,29167
29167,6,21,Barney ,Can you believe it? This is awesome!,130,29168
29168,6,21,Robin ,"Barney, how is that awesome?",131,29169
29169,6,21,Barney ,I finally know what it's like to be embarrassed by my dad.,132,29170
29170,6,21,Marshall ,So you really believe that if we were in an open marriage that you would do better than me?,133,29171
29171,6,21,Lily ,"Hey, you do better than me at a lot of other things, like digesting dairy... and reaching for stuff.",134,29172
29172,6,21,Marhsall ,"Okay, you know what? Game on. If I can score five numbers before you can, then we have s*x in the bathroom. But... if you can score five numbers before me, then we have s*x in the bathroom.",135,29173
29173,6,21,Lily ,So our usual wager. Deal.,136,29174
29174,6,21,Barney ,"Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y... you really want to be out here like this?",137,29175
29175,6,21,Jerry ,"Oh, sorry, small-town preacher from the Midwest, is there a law against dancing?",138,29176
29176,6,21,Barney ,"No, of course not. I... I just...",139,29177
29177,6,21,Jerry ,"Oh, this club blows. Let's hit the greatest party in the world, the streets of New York!",140,29178
29178,6,21,Barney ,"Yeah! Let's do it! Uh, maybe fix the tie. But mostly, party!",141,29179
29179,6,21,Robin ,"Okay, Jerry's gone; Let's break up.",142,29180
29180,6,21,Ted ,"Okay. ""I would have stolen you a whole orchestra."" There. What's the rush?",143,29181
29181,6,21,Robin ,"Well, that guy who came over here who thinks we're dating, I kind of have a crush on him. Can you help me clear it up?",144,29182
29182,6,21,Ted ,"Really? That guy? He was, like, a four.",145,29183
29183,6,21,Robin ,"A four? God, you are, like, the worst judge of guys ever. Okay, if he is a four, what are you?",146,29184
29184,6,21,Ted ,Hey! I'm not perfect; I'm an eight... and a half.,147,29185
29185,6,21,Robin ,You're a doofus and a half.,148,29186
29186,6,21,Ted ,Fine. Let's go talk to him. Where'd you meet this booger-eater anyway?,149,29187
29187,6,21,Robin ,At a close-out sale at Dawes.,150,29188
29188,6,21,Ted ,Really? I remember that sale.,151,29189
29189,6,21,Ted ,"Hey, Robin.",152,29190
29190,6,21,Robin ,"Oh, Ted. Oh, no.",153,29191
29191,6,21,Ted ,Look what I just bought. Right? Right? (He is wearing the Red Boots),154,29192
29192,6,21,Ted ,"Hold on. We were dating then. I specifically remember, because we had great s*x that night. Great s*x.",155,29193
29193,6,21,Ted ,Let me guess. Someone wants to knock... boots. Boots. (imitating g*nshots),156,29194
29194,6,21,Robin ,Just take off your damn shirt. Okay.,157,29195
29195,6,21,Ted ,All right.,158,29196
29196,6,21,Robin ,"All right. Whoa, stop.",159,29197
29197,6,21,Ted ,What?,160,29198
29198,6,21,Robin ,Stop. Perfect.,161,29199
29199,6,21,Ted ,"But I... I can't see, and you can't see me.",162,29200
29200,6,21,Robin ,"Yeah. Yeah, just like that.",163,29201
29201,6,21,Ted ,You were picturing your crush!,164,29202
29202,6,21,Robin ,"Well, somebody had to.",165,29203
29203,6,21,Ted ,"Okay, okay, answer me this. Are you absolutely sure it had nothing whatsoever... to do with the boots?",166,29204
29204,6,21,Robin ,Yes.,167,29205
29205,6,21,,"Ted, loudly: You hear that, everybody? She said ""yes""! We're getting married! (Ted chuckles) I love this girl. I'm never letting her go.",168,29206
29206,6,21,Jerry ,"Hey... Bottoms up, amigo!",169,29207
29207,6,21,,"Ted from 2030: After that, Barney's memory of the night got a little hazy.",170,29208
29208,6,21,,"Jerry, to a big tattoed biker: You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy! You don't even know!",171,29209
29209,6,21,Barney ,"(laughing): Hey, hey! There we go!",172,29210
29210,6,21,Jerry ,"Oh, look what I just ripped out of the ground!",173,29211
29211,6,21,Barney ,Oh...!,174,29212
29212,6,21,Jerry ,I just puked on the hood of that... police car! (Laughing),175,29213
29213,6,21,Jerry ,"Too bad your playwright friend isn't a lawyer. Barney, I'm so sorry. I'm afraid this is what it's like hanging out with Crazy Jerry.",176,29214
29214,6,21,Barney ,"It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So... next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special...",177,29215
29215,6,21,Jerry ,"Oh, for corn's sake, Barney, I'm not drunk!",178,29216
29216,6,21,Barney ,What?,179,29217
29217,6,21,Jerry ,"I told you, I don't party anymore, and you wouldn't take no for an answer. So... I used a little... sleight-of-hand... to make you think otherwise.",180,29218
29218,6,21,Jerry ,Here you go.,181,29219
29219,6,21,,"Barney, laughing: Whoa!",182,29220
29220,6,21,Jerry ,"Bottoms up, amigo!",183,29221
29221,6,21,Barney ,But all those crazy things you did.,184,29222
29222,6,21,Jerry ,Do you happen to remember what a magician's best friend is?,185,29223
29223,6,21,Barney ,A drunk audience.,186,29224
29224,6,21,,"Jerry, to a dummy wearing a biker outfit: You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy!",187,29225
29225,6,21,Barney ,"No, no, no. You don't even know! Right here!",188,29226
29226,6,21,Jerry ,Look. Look what I just ripped out of the ground!,189,29227
29227,6,21,Barney ,Oh...!,190,29228
29228,6,21,Barney ,What just happened?,191,29229
29229,6,21,Jerry ,I... I just puked on the hood of that... (siren blares)...police car.,192,29230
29230,6,21,Barney ,"Well, why do all those things?",193,29231
29231,6,21,Jerry ,"I figured if I showed you what... ""never stop partying"" really looked like, you'd realize you can't do it forever. (sighs heavily) Oh, well.",194,29232
29232,6,21,Barney ,You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy...!,195,29233
29233,6,21,Jerry ,I wanted to hang out with you... you're my son. And since you didn't want to come with me and J.J. On that fishing tri... Fishing trip. I'll never make it back in time now.,196,29234
29234,6,21,Barney ,"Hey, you know, a... a pretty good magician like you probably knows how to, say, get out of a standard set of handcuffs.",197,29235
29235,6,21,Jerry ,Perhaps.,198,29236
29236,6,21,Barney ,"Well, here's something you didn't know... I'm a pretty good magician, too. (They escape and run away) Abracadabra!",199,29237
29237,6,21,Woman ,Congratulations!,200,29238
29238,6,21,Robin ,"Oh, hey! Thank you so much. We're super excited. We're thinking June. (laughs) Yeah, okay. Okay, jerk, do you remember how you ended up buying those red cowboy boots?",201,29239
29239,6,21,,"Ted, chuckling: Wow. Wardrobe malfunction at the O.K. Corral! I mean, who in their right mind would ever...",202,29240
29240,6,21,Woman ,You would look so totally hot in those.,203,29241
29241,6,21,Ted ,Do you have these in a size 11?,204,29242
29242,6,21,Robin ,"So get off the field at the Superdome, because you ain't no saint.",205,29243
29243,6,21,Marshall ,Hello.,206,29244
29244,6,21,Robin ,"I, uh... Oh.",207,29245
29245,6,21,Marshall ,"Hi, Robin. Could I have your phone number?",208,29246
29246,6,21,Barney ,We need someplace to hide.,209,29247
29247,6,21,Jerry ,Where?,210,29248
29248,6,21,Barney ,"No, Jerry, this is not the time to go to another club! We've got to get you back home in time for that trip. But there's no more trains, there's no cabs.",211,29249
29249,6,21,Jerry ,"Well, uh... I do have a few driving students in the city.",212,29250
29250,6,21,Barney ,Step on it! Jerry...,213,29251
29251,6,21,Jerry ,Do not step on it.,214,29252
29252,6,21,Barney ,"Jerry, we have got to get you home in time for that fishing trip.",215,29253
29253,6,21,Jerry ,The laws are there to protect...,216,29254
29254,6,21,Barney ,This is no time for laws!,217,29255
29255,6,21,Jerry ,"Buckle up, Barney.",218,29256
29256,6,21,Barney ,I am not going to buckle up!,219,29257
29257,6,21,Jerry ,I am your father! You will listen to me!,220,29258
29258,6,21,Ted ,Hey! How's the open marriage going? Who was the first one to get the five numbers?,221,29259
29259,6,21,Lily ,I won that race. My prize... s*x in the bathroom.,222,29260
29260,6,21,Marshall ,And I won that race.,223,29261
29261,6,21,Lily ,"Aw, sorry that secret crush didn't work out for you.",224,29262
29262,6,21,Robin ,"Oh, it's okay. I guess it just wasn't meant to be.",225,29263
29263,6,21,Lily ,Why are you smiling?,226,29264
29264,6,21,Robin ,I don't know. Good night.,227,29265
29265,6,21,,"Man, on the phone: Saw that girl again. And guess what? She's engaged. So that's the end of that.",228,29266
29266,6,21,,Ted from 2030: It wasn't the end of that. More on that later,229,29267
29267,6,21,Man ,And her fiancé? The guy's like a two.,230,29268
29268,6,21,Barney ,How did you do it?,231,29269
29269,6,21,Jerry ,Do what?,232,29270
29270,6,21,Barney ,"How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but... I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs...",233,29271
29271,6,21,Jerry ,You're drifting.,234,29272
29272,6,21,Barney ,"Hey, I'm trying to open up to you...",235,29273
29273,6,21,Jerry ,"No, Mrs. Perkins, you're drifting! Go on, Barney.",236,29274
29274,6,21,Barney ,"When I think about going for anything more than that, I look at my life, and who I am, and... I'm too far gone. I'm broken.",237,29275
29275,6,21,Jerry ,"Son, I was far more broken than you'll ever be. And look at me now. Don't get me wrong... settling down is... a challenge. It's the biggest challenge of your life.",238,29276
29276,6,21,,Barney:So how do you do it?,239,29277
29277,6,21,Jerry ,A magician never reveals his greatest trick. But I'll give you a hint. You gotta meet the right girl. Who knows? Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow.,240,29278
29278,6,21,,Barney:Maybe I've met her already.,241,29279
29279,6,21,Jerry ,"And park. And emergency brake. I did have a good time tonight. And hey, if you want to go fishing, we got room in the boat.",242,29280
29280,6,21,,Barney:Maybe some other time.,243,29281
29281,6,21,Jerry ,"Okay. Oh, and, uh... thanks for taking such good care of this. It means a lot to me that you kept it safe all these years.",244,29282
29282,6,21,,Barney:I'm going fishing with my dad.,245,29283
29283,6,21,Barney ,This... sucks.,246,29284
29284,6,22,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when your Uncle Marshall finally quit Goliath National Bank to do something better with his life, he left on great terms with his boss.",1,29285
29285,6,22,Arthur ,"Good luck, Marshall. And promise you'll list me as a reference.",2,29286
29286,6,22,,Ted from 2030: Which made Marshall's big interview with a respected environmental organization all the more confusing.,3,29287
29287,6,22,,Head of the environmental Organization: I'm sorry. I don't think you're the kind of person we're looking for. I just got off the phone with Arthur Hobbs over at GNB.,4,29288
29288,6,22,Arthur ,"Oh, yeah, I worked with Marshall Eriksen... at least I did when he actually showed up.",5,29289
29289,6,22,Arthur ,"Marshall! Hey, it's, uh, it's 2:30. If it's no big deal, we'd sure love it if you'd try to get here at least before lunch.",6,29290
29290,6,22,Marshall ,Yeah? And I'd sure love to give a rat's ass.,7,29291
29291,6,22,Assistant ,Oh! Mr. Eriksen... You're not wearing any pants.,8,29292
29292,6,22,Marshall ,Your move.,9,29293
29293,6,22,Assistant ,"But Marshall, wh... What about the environment?",10,29294
29294,6,22,Marshall ,Screw the environment!,11,29295
29295,6,22,,"Head of the environmental Organization: ""Screw the environment""?!",12,29296
29296,6,22,Arthur ,"Oh, yeah. We fired him when we caught him clubbing a seal in his office with an even cuter seal. The guy's a maniac. He's just an awful, flatulent racist.",13,29297
29297,6,22,Marshall ,"Sir, none of that is...",14,29298
29298,6,22,,Head of the environmental Organization: Sorry. Interview over.,15,29299

29301,6,22,Barney ,"Invitations for the demolition of The Arcadian. As head of the project, I get to decide how we knock it down. I'm torn between training an actual coyote to use an ACME dynamite plunger, or hooking up a fuse to Eddie Van Halen's guitar that goes off the second he hits the last note to ""Hot For Teacher."" Barney! Barney! Bar... No, no. I'm going to go coyote.",18,29302
29302,6,22,Robin ,"Wait. While no one wants to see a, uh, coyote wearing a little hard hat more than me, remember: Zoey's protest could still shut your whole project down.",19,29303
29303,6,22,Barney ,"Oh, come on. Zoey's not shutting anything down, standing out there with her stupid megaphone, screaming in the wind; butt cheeks trembling with fury; her perky breasts heaving; her self-righteous nipples...",20,29304
29304,6,22,Ted ,"Dude, that's my girlfriend.",21,29305
29305,6,22,Barney ,"Point is, we are taking her and The Arcadian down. Am I right, Teddy Westside?",22,29306
29306,6,22,Ted ,You know it.,23,29307
29307,6,22,Lily ,"Okay. See, that's so weird to me. One second you're defending Zoey, and the next, you're talking about her going down.",24,29308
29308,6,22,Barney ,"Glad to know she's also mouthy in a good way. What up? Dude, that's his girlfriend.",25,29309
29309,6,22,Lily ,Isn't it tough dating the woman that's trying to prevent your building from being built?,26,29310
29310,6,22,Ted ,"At first, yes, but we figured out a great way to deal with it: we never talk about it. And since then, we've really been enjoying each other's company.",27,29311
29311,6,22,Lily ,"So, every time The Arcadian comes up, you guys just awkwardly change the subject?",28,29312
29312,6,22,Ted ,"Yeah, but you'd be surprised. It doesn't even come up that often.",29,29313
29313,6,22,Zoey ,"Hey, guys.",30,29314
29314,6,22,All ,Hey!,31,29315
29315,6,22,Zoey ,Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.,32,29316
29316,6,22,Ted ,So Oprah's retiring. Oof! What's that world gonna be like?,33,29317
29317,6,22,Robin ,"Wait, Marshall's helping you save The Arcadian, now.",34,29318
29318,6,22,Zoey ,Yeah. Having a former GNB employee on our side is huge for us. GNB is going down.,35,29319
29319,6,22,Marshall ,"Yeah, totally.",36,29320
29320,6,22,Ted ,"So, they found water on Mars. What?",37,29321
29321,6,22,Marshall ,"Listen, um, I hate to go up against my two best friends, but... I really, I really need this right now. I mean, we're, we're cool, right?",38,29322
29322,6,22,Barney ,"Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day?",39,29323
29323,6,22,Lily ,That was on purpose!,40,29324
29324,6,22,Barney ,I mean this is really like...,41,29325
29325,6,22,Marshall ,"Barney, please...",42,29326
29326,6,22,,Ted from 2030: And thus began an all-out war between Barney and Marshall...,43,29327
29327,6,22,Delivery Guy, Delivery from Mr. Stinson.,44,29328
29328,6,22,Zoey ,"Barney sent us pictures of himself. Oh, God. What's he doing to that megaphone?!",45,29329
29329,6,22,Marshall ,Oh! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!,46,29330
29330,6,22,,"Ted from 2030: Later, back at the bar... another war was just beginning.",47,29331
29331,6,22,Lily ,"Babe, can I get you a drink?",48,29332
29332,6,22,Marshall ,"No, I'm still not... ready to put my mouth on anything yet.",49,29333
29333,6,22,Lily ,I know.,50,29334
29334,6,22,Marshall ,You know what? Screw this. Game on.,51,29335
29335,6,22,Lily ,Can you believe this one? Wants our booth. Keeps giving us the walk-by.,52,29336
29336,6,22,Robin ,That bitch is not giving us the walk-by.,53,29337
29337,6,22,Lily ,The walk-by with the stink eye.,54,29338
29338,6,22,,"Robin, in a high-pitched voice: A stink-eye-walk-by?! Aw, hell no! I hope this drink isn't teething, 'cause it's about to get nursed.",55,29339
29339,6,22,Marshall ,Barney! Your wife just called from the hospital! It's a boy!,56,29340
29340,6,22,Barney ,No. I' was... I was...,57,29341
29341,6,22,,Ted from 2030: This went on for days.,58,29342
29342,6,22,,"Marshall, to the girl Barney is talking to: Congratulations. You're about to be the 250th girl that Barney has slept with.",59,29343
29343,6,22,Barney ,"Pfff. Try 283. 250 was months ago. No, no, no. No, I mean, you're totally 250, baby. No, don't. (The girl leaves)",60,29344
29344,6,22,Marshall ,"Oh, bye-bye.",61,29345
29345,6,22,Marshall ,"Mr. Stinson... I had to rush down as soon as I got your results. I'm sorry, but your crabs have super-herpes. (The girl leaves in a hurry)",62,29346
29346,6,22,Lily ,"Oh, boy. Look who's back.",63,29347
29347,6,22,Robin ,"Look, Lily, I think this girl wants our seats. Should we leave... or stay here Lionel Richie style ""All Night Long""?",64,29348
29348,6,22,Lily ,"Excuse me waitress, I'll have a mojito! And you'll have a no-seat-ho.",65,29349
29349,6,22,Marshall ,"Ah, yes... the sweet, smoky taste of victory.",66,29350
29350,6,22,Barney ,Are you sure it doesn't taste like anything else?,67,29351
29351,6,22,Marshall ,That's it!,68,29352
29352,6,22,Barney ,Kent! Kent!,69,29353
29353,6,22,Marshall ,"Oh, God! Ow... Why would you do that to your own jacket?!",70,29354
29354,6,22,Barney ,"That's what you get, you traitor!",71,29355
29355,6,22,Marshall ,"Oh, really? Really?",72,29356
29356,6,22,Barney ,Yeah. Really.,73,29357
29357,6,22,Marshall ,Really. That... what...,74,29358
29358,6,22,Carl ,"Okay, enough! You guys are out of here.",75,29359
29359,6,22,Robin ,Ejected!,76,29360
29360,6,22,Carl ,I meant all of you. You're all banned from the bar. Out!,77,29361
29361,6,22,Robin ,"Carl! Oh... This has nothing to do with us. You're totally ridiculous. (The girls stand up and leave the booth; the other girl sits down at their booth) Don't look, baby. Just don't look. Come on.",78,29362
29362,6,22,Lily ,"This stupid feud isn't going to end until Marshall and Barney finally talk about their feelings, cry, and then hug it out like they do on Oprah.",79,29363
29363,6,22,Robin ,"Man, what are we going to do without her?",80,29364
29364,6,22,Lily ,Oh...,81,29365
29365,6,22,Robin ,"Wait, you know what, these guys are not going to get all mushy sober. We need to get these bitches drunk.",82,29366
29366,6,22,Lily ,"Yes, but the right kind of drunk. Uh... we should go with something mellow. Maybe red wine?",83,29367
29367,6,22,Robin ,"Oh, I don't know. Red wine has kind of an odd effect on Barney. He reaches a point of sad clarity.",84,29368
29368,6,22,All ,"Ten, nine, eight...",85,29369
29369,6,22,Barney ,"I'm a B-plus. My whole life, I was hoping to be an A, and I'm a B-plus. And I'm okay with that.",86,29370
29370,6,22,All ,Happy New Year!,87,29371
29371,6,22,Robin ,"If we want them to open up, I say we go straight-up gin.",88,29372
29372,6,22,Lily ,Oh... last time Marshall got gin-drunk was at that douchey bar Barney likes to go to. Marshall almost got in a fight that night.,89,29373
29373,6,22,Marshall ,"Look at this meatball. He's headed right towards me, showing me no respect. Well, if he wants to play chicken, this rooster ain't backing down! Oh. Mirror.",90,29374
29374,6,22,Lily ,How about martinis?,91,29375
29375,6,22,Robin ,Absolutely not. I'm not going anywhere near you and a martini.,92,29376
29376,6,22,Lily ,Why not?,93,29377
29377,6,22,Lily ,"Ooh... You know what would be stupid? If we made out. That would be so stupid. Hey, I dare you guys to dare us to make out.",94,29378
29378,6,22,Robin ,Every time.,95,29379
29379,6,22,Lily ,I only say that because it would be so stupid if we did. So stupid...,96,29380
29380,6,22,Robin ,Uh-huh.,97,29381
29381,6,22,Lily ,"Oh, yeah? Well... what about you and absinthe?",98,29382
29382,6,22,Marshall ,"I don't know. We could have water, soda, purple stuff...",99,29383
29383,6,22,Robin ,We're a dream a baby's having. We're a dream a baby's having.,100,29384
29384,6,22,Lily ,"I keep telling you, that didn't happen.",101,29385
29385,6,22,Robin ,"It happened, and it changed me. How about daiquiris?",102,29386
29386,6,22,Lily ,Maybe. When Marshall has daiquiris... he gets really into how beautiful he is.,103,29387
29387,6,22,,"Marshall, talking to a mirror: Hey. I dare you guys to dare us to make out.",104,29388
29388,6,22,Ted ,"Hey, Marsh, you know that's another mirror, right?",105,29389
29389,6,22,Lily ,Peppermint schnapps?,106,29390
29390,6,22,Robin ,No. Peppermint schnapps turns Barney into Richard Dawson.,107,29391
29391,6,22,Lily ,Who?,108,29392
29392,6,22,Robin ,"The crazy old host of Family Feud, who greeted women by kissing them on the mouth.",109,29393
29393,6,22,Barney ,"Hey there, darlin'. How you doin'? Ah, is this your sister? Mmm... Beautiful. Mmm...",110,29394
29394,6,22,Ted ,"Hey, where are our chicken wings?",111,29395
29395,6,22,Barney ,Show me chicken wings!,112,29396
29396,6,22,All ,"Good order, Ted! Good order!",113,29397
29397,6,22,Ted ,"Okay, I'm gonna go pick up Zoey, then we're off. See you Sunday.",114,29398
29398,6,22,Lily ,"Oh, wait, Ted. Do you have a specific reaction to any kind of alcohol?",115,29399
29399,6,22,Ted ,Bourbon. When I drink bourbon... I get weirdly good at beatboxing.,116,29400
29400,6,22,Ted ,"Peace, I'm out.",117,29401
29401,6,22,Lily ,"Yeah, Ted, I hate to tell you, but the bourbon only makes it sound good to you.",118,29402
29402,6,22,Ted ,Peace. I'm out.,119,29403
29403,6,22,Ted ,"You had to take that away from me, didn't you? (He takes a bottle of Bourbon out of his bag and put it on the table)",120,29404
29404,6,22,Robin ,"Well, enjoy Martha's Vineyard. Hopefully by the time you get back, we'll be allowed back into MacLaren's.",121,29405
29405,6,22,Ted ,What do you mean?,122,29406
29406,6,22,Lily ,Barney and Marshall's feud got us banned from the bar. We lost our booth.,123,29407
29407,6,22,Robin ,Stop.,124,29408
29408,6,22,Ted ,"Man, how did things get so screwed up?",125,29409
29409,6,22,,Ted from 2030: Of course I knew the answer to that. I was dating her. But I wasn't about to ruin our first big romantic weekend away by bringing up the one topic we agreed was completely off-limits.,126,29410
29410,6,22,Ted ,You and The Arcadian are ruining my life! What?,127,29411
29411,6,22,Zoey ,I thought we weren't talking about...,128,29412
29412,6,22,Ted ,"We're talking about this. Look, I can handle you trying to prevent me from fulfilling a life-long dream. That's just being in a relationship. But now? You turn my best friend against me?",129,29413
29413,6,22,Zoey ,Marshall made his own choice. Why aren't you mad at him?,130,29414
29414,6,22,Ted ,"Because he's going through a lot right now. He, he's looking for something to believe in, and you took advantage of that. You're, you're just like those Internet swindlers who tricked him into paying 300 bucks for a lock of Sasquatch fur.",131,29415
29415,6,22,Zoey ,"You cannot compare The Arcadian to a Ziploc bag full of Turkish armpit hair. The Arcadian is a beautiful, magnificent hotel.",132,29416
29416,6,22,Ted ,Okay. You know what? We're settling this once and for all.,133,29417
29417,6,22,Zoey ,Okay.,134,29418
29418,6,22,Lily ,We've cross-referenced every alcohol with Marshall and Barney's reaction. What's the right drink for this situation?,135,29419
29419,6,22,Robin ,"Well, they're not talking. They're not even looking at each other. That reminds me of those awkward Sunday dinners with my mom, my dad and his mistress. Families, right?",136,29420
29420,6,22,Lily ,I-I guess. That... seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight.,137,29421
29421,6,22,Barney ,Do you know what I had to do to get you that job?,138,29422
29422,6,22,Marshall ,Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day?,139,29423
29423,6,22,Barney ,"What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like?",140,29424
29424,6,22,Marshall ,I showed up with wet hair once! Once!,141,29425
29425,6,22,Barney ,"Oh, my God.",142,29426
29426,6,22,Ted ,"Well, here we are. I had a reservation at a four-star inn overlooking the ocean but, uh... How can that compete with such a beautiful, magnificent hotel? Welcome to The Arcadian. So here's the deal. If you can last until sunrise in your precious Arcadian, I'll join your side.",143,29427
29427,6,22,Zoey ,You're on. This place is fantastic. They even left a chocolate on the pillow.,144,29428
29428,6,22,Ted ,That's not a chocolate.,145,29429
29429,6,22,Robin ,"Okay, now we need to get them something that will make them emotionally vulnerable and completely, pathetically honest.",146,29430
29430,6,22,Lily ,"Yeah, we need a drink that, that takes subtext and turns it into text. Yeah.",147,29431
29431,6,22,Marshall ,"See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation. That's why The Arcadian speaks to me.",148,29432
29432,6,22,Barney ,"Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that...",149,29433
29433,6,22,Marshall ,"Oh God, I didn't even think of that...",150,29434
29434,6,22,Barney ,"It made me wonder, ""What could I have done to make him stay?""",151,29435
29435,6,22,Marshall ,"Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney.",152,29436
29436,6,22,Barney ,That's what everyone keeps saying but people just keep leaving me.,153,29437
29437,6,22,Robin ,Wow. That got real o'clock.,154,29438
29438,6,22,Lily ,Yeah. We need to get them up and having fun.,155,29439
29439,6,22,Robin ,"Dance, my puppets, dance!",156,29440
29440,6,22,Lily ,Now do you see why I'm always interfering in other people's lives?,157,29441
29441,6,22,Robin ,"Oh, God, totally!",158,29442
29442,6,22,Zoey ,"Well, we're here for the night. Might as well have some fun. Dare to join me?",159,29443
29443,6,22,Ted ,"Dust just flew out of that comforter in the shape of a skull. Whoa, something just passed through me. Can you get STDs from the ghost of a prostitute?",160,29444
29444,6,22,Ted ,What are... What are you doing in our bathroom?,161,29445
29445,6,22,Woman ,This bathroom for entire floor!,162,29446
29446,6,22,Lily ,Okay. Final round. What simple act will get the boys to finally forgive each other?,163,29447
29447,6,22,Robin ,"Sharing a brandy. Which is what I walked in on my parents doing once. Brandy was my father's mistress. God, parents. Right?",164,29448
29448,6,22,Lily ,"Again, just a whole other thing, sweetie. Where'd they go? Oh, no. They did shots.",165,29449
29449,6,22,Robin ,What? What is it?,166,29450
29450,6,22,Lily ,What's the worst thing they could possibly drink right now?,167,29451
29451,6,22,Barney ,Your place or mi... Your place or mi... Le-Let's go to your place. Mm.,168,29452
29452,6,22,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, don't drink tequila.",169,29453
29453,6,22,Ted ,"Uh, these were supposed to be for a romantic dinner on our balcony as we were serenaded by the sounds of the ocean. But I guess we'll have to settle for what sounded like two very large men having s*x next door... with a third very small man.",170,29454
29454,6,22,Zoey ,I think that small man sounded very moved by The Arcadian's beauty.,171,29455
29455,6,22,Ted ,"Okay. What is it? And don't give me, ""It's beautiful."" Don't give me, ""It's magnificent"" What is it about this place that makes you so passionate to save it?",172,29456
29456,6,22,Zoey ,Well... When I was a little girl... my family used to live here.,173,29457
29457,6,22,Ted ,"Why, why have you never told me that?",174,29458
29458,6,22,Zoey ,"I never told anyone that. It makes it sound like it would be impossible for me to be objective, but... The truth is, I... I loved growing up here. We had just moved to New York. We were completely broke. But my mom told my sisters and me that The Arcadian was a castle. And we believed her. I know it's not what it used to be... but this building is a part of who I am. And that's why I want so badly for you to like it, too.",175,29459
29459,6,22,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, you never forget the first time or place you tell a girl:",176,29460
29460,6,22,Ted ,I love you.,177,29461
29461,6,22,Zoey ,"I love you, too.",178,29462
29462,6,22,Carl ,"Come on in, you're un-banned. I gave these guys some drinks and they calmed down and made up.",179,29463
29463,6,22,Robin ,"Well, what drink finally did the trick?",180,29464
29464,6,22,,"Robin & Lily: Of course, beer.",181,29465
29465,6,22,Marshall ,I love you.,182,29466
29466,6,22,Barney ,I love you.,183,29467
29467,6,22,Barney ,"Uh, no. N-Not right...",184,29468
29468,6,22,Ted ,"You know, I guess this place isn't so bad.",185,29469
29469,6,22,Zoey ,"See? With a little renovation, we could restore it to its former... What was that?",186,29470
29470,6,22,Ted ,What was what?,187,29471
29471,6,22,Zoey ,I think it went under the bed.,188,29472
29472,6,22,Ted ,I don't see anything.,189,29473
29473,6,22,Zoey ,"That, that was... that!",190,29474
29474,6,22,Ted ,"Oh, my God! It's the cock-a-mouse!",191,29475
29475,6,22,Zoey ,The what?,192,29476
29476,6,22,Ted ,"Cock-a-mouse. Part cockroach, part mouse. It used to live in our apartment. It must have settled here, and... Oh! Look, it had babies! Good for it.",193,29477
29477,6,22,Zoey ,Ew.... I give up. You win. Let's go!,194,29478
29478,6,22,Lily ,"Be well, my friends! Aw, just how we left them.",195,29479
29479,6,22,Robin ,Morning. Who wants breakfast?,196,29480
29480,6,22,Barney ,You have some coffee? So I can throw it in this traitor's face?,197,29481
29481,6,22,Marshall ,"Oh, yeah? Hey! Hey! Do you guys have some pancakes, because I... would really like some pancakes. They're fantastic. Let's be honest, I love them. But I hate this guy!",198,29482
29482,6,22,Lily ,I thought they made up last night.,199,29483
29483,6,22,Robin ,"Damn it, I know what happened.",200,29484
29484,6,22,Marshall ,I love you.,201,29485

29486,6,22,Lily ,"Carl, a round of champagne.",203,29487
29487,6,22,Lily ,Ooh! The champagne.,204,29488
29488,6,22,Robin ,We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing.,205,29489
29489,6,22,Barney ,"What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?",206,29490
29490,6,22,Ted ,"Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too.",207,29491
29491,6,22,Barney ,"Whoa, whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Ted...",208,29492
29492,6,22,Robin ,"Okay, what drink can fix this?",209,29493
29493,6,22,Lily ,Mama's done with this drama. What drink can fix the headache these clowns are giving me?,210,29494
29494,6,22,Robin ,I got it.,211,29495
29495,6,22,Robin ,Right?,212,29496

29497,6,22,Woman ,What is that?,214,29498
29498,6,23,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, this is a story of landmarks. There are certain moments in life when you have to decide which things you can stand to see torn down, and which things you have to preserve, no matter what. Such a moment came for all of us in May of 2011, at a special meeting of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, where the fate of The Arcadian would be decided once and for all.",1,29499
29499,6,23,Marshall ,"A symbol of strength and constancy, the stone lion of The Arcadian has watched over New Yorkers for generations. So remember: if the lion head stonework is regal, then tearing it down should be illegal. Well. Did you like that? All right, uh... We must make sure the lion is always there. Destroy The Arcadian? Oh, no, don't you dare. Yeah? Yeah? Okay. Try this one on for size... If you want New York's history at your beck and call...",2,29500
29500,6,23,Chairman ,"All right, thank you, Mr. Eriksen.",3,29501
29501,6,23,Marshall ,I just have...,4,29502
29502,6,23,Chairman ,"We will now hear from the architect of the proposed GNB Tower, Ted Mosby. Now, uh, Mr. Mosby, let's just cut right to the chase. Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?...Okay, it's killing me. What rhymes with ""beck and call?""",5,29503
29503,6,23,Marshall ,Wrecking ball. Don't go swinging no wrecking ball.,6,29504
29504,6,23,Audience ,Ah...,7,29505
29505,6,23,Marshall ,Thank you.,8,29506
29506,6,23,Chairman ,"Mr. Mosby, do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? It's not a difficult question.",9,29507
29507,6,23,,"Ted from 2030: Actually, it a difficult question. Of course, had he asked me a few days earlier, I would have immediately said...",10,29508
29508,6,23,Ted ,"""Yes. The Arcadian should be a landmark."" And then the crowd gasps: ""Oh, my God! Did he really just say that? Oh, heavens! Oh, my stars! I must clutch my pearls!""",11,29509
29509,6,23,Zoey ,So these things are generally attended by old Southern ladies?,12,29510
29510,6,23,Ted ,"Almost exclusively. But here's my point: If they ask GNB's chief architect... aka me... if The Arcadian should be a landmark, and I say ""yes""?",13,29511
29511,6,23,Zoey ,"That, no, that wasn't The Arcadian being destroyed; that was GNB's hopes of destroying The Arcadian.",14,29512
29512,6,23,Marshall ,"I'm sorry, I should have been more clear.",15,29513
29513,6,23,Zoey ,Yeah. The Arcadian's gonna be all like...,16,29514
29514,6,23,Marshall ,Nice.,17,29515
29515,6,23,Robin ,I have a message from Barney.,18,29516
29516,6,23,,Ted from 2030: Things between Barney and the rest of us had gotten a little frosty. First this happened.,19,29517
29517,6,23,Zoey ,Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.,20,29518
29518,6,23,,Ted from 2030: And then this happened.,21,29519
29519,6,23,Zoey ,"What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead, sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?!",22,29520
29520,6,23,Ted ,"Dude! That's my girlfriend. And ya know what? I'm on her side now, too.",23,29521
29521,6,23,,Ted from 2030: Which led to this happening.,24,29522
29522,6,23,Zoey ,"Message from Barney? That's my cue to leave. Good night, guys. I love you.",25,29523
29523,6,23,Ted ,"Mmm. Love you, too.",26,29524
29524,6,23,Lily ,"All right, what's the message? 'Cause if it's another hypothetical yet eerily accurate drawing of my boobs...",27,29525
29525,6,23,Robin ,"Yeah, I have that, too.",28,29526
29526,6,23,Lily ,Damn it.,29,29527
29527,6,23,Robin ,"All right, here's the message. (clears throat, then reads Barney's note) ""Oh, hey, guys. Didn't see you there. I was too busy feelin' fine and..."" Really? ""Feelin' fine and gettin' some 'jine. You may have noticed the giant plate of hot wings in front of me. I know how much you love hot wings. Too bad someone bribed the kitchen to take them off the menu tonight. So, if you want some, you're going to have to come back to GNB. But hurry, this offer will be gone lickety-split. (Barney licks his hot wings peace by peace then throws them down) Do evil laugh."" Oh, um... (makes a poor impression of Barney's laugh) So, what are you turds up to?",30,29528
29528,6,23,Marshall ,"Oh, we've got the big LPC meeting in two days. I have my whole presentation worked out. I just need to find a good rhyme to end on.",31,29529
29529,6,23,Ted ,Why does it need to rhyme?,32,29530
29530,6,23,Marshall ,"If you end an argument with a rhyme, it's convincing all the time.",33,29531
29531,6,23,Lily ,"Yeah. It's why in our apartment: If you're a-hopin' to score, don't leave your socks on the floor.",34,29532
29532,6,23,Marshall ,And she hasn't since.,35,29533
29533,6,23,Barney ,"Okay, okay. A couple of things. Lily, how'd I do?",36,29534
29534,6,23,Marshall ,Nailed it.,37,29535
29535,6,23,Barney ,"Secondly, Ted, I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey. Are you really going to walk away from this project just because you're mad at me?",38,29536
29536,6,23,Ted ,"It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been dead for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands.",39,29537
29537,6,23,Barney ,I understand. Zoey has magic lady bits.,40,29538
29538,6,23,Ted ,What?,41,29539
29539,6,23,Barney ,"Zoey's lady bits... are magic, and that's how she controls your mind. You see, every few hundred millennia, lady bits leap forward...",42,29540
29540,6,23,Lily ,"I know you're only just getting started, but this is already gross.",43,29541
29541,6,23,Barney ,I once knew such a girl.,44,29542
29542,6,23,Barney ,It was last call. In this very bar.,45,29543
29543,6,23,Barney ,What...?! No... What?!...No... What?!,46,29544
29544,6,23,Robin ,"Um... thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story.",47,29545
29545,6,23,Ted ,"Barney, this is about the building.",48,29546
29546,6,23,Barney ,Come on. This is so about the girl.,49,29547
29547,6,23,Ted ,"Okay, fine. It's about the girl! I am doing this for Zoey! I'm in love with her. Look, I know it's early, but there is a very good chance Zoey might be the mother of my children. So, in addition to doing this for John Clifford Larrabee, I'm also doing this for Luke and Leia.",50,29548
29548,6,23,Lily ,Wait. She's gonna let you name your kids Luke and Leia?,51,29549
29549,6,23,Ted ,"Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't. Barney, I'm sorry.",52,29550
29550,6,23,Barney ,"Oh, you're not sorry now, Ted Mosby. But you will be. You... will... be. (laughing harder and louder) That's how you do an evil laugh. Ciao for now.",53,29551
29551,6,23,,"Ted from 2030: Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs, Barney and Marshall's old boss at GNB? Well, Arthur was going through a divorce and taking it kind of hard.",54,29552
29552,6,23,Barney ,"Hi, Arthur. Everything okay?",55,29553
29553,6,23,Arthur ,"No, everything's not okay. My stupid wife got custody of Tugboat. God, I should have kept her hidden in a cage in the basement.",56,29554
29554,6,23,Barney ,Isn't that animal cruelty?,57,29555
29555,6,23,Arthur ,I'm talking about my wife.,58,29556
29556,6,23,Barney ,"Oh. That's fine, then. So listen, you know Ted, the architect?",59,29557
29557,6,23,Arthur ,"Yeah, I know your friend Ted.",60,29558
29558,6,23,Barney ,"So, if Ted stood up at that big meeting tomorrow and said that he thought The Arcadian should be a landmark... You wouldn't just fire him, would you? (laughing uncomfortably) Right? You wouldn't just... You wouldn't just... yeah...",61,29559
29559,6,23,Arthur ,"No, Barney. I wouldn't just fire him. I'd also fire you.",62,29560
29560,6,23,Barney ,Come again for Big Fudge?,63,29561
29561,6,23,Barney ,"Can you believe that?! I can't be unemployed, Robin! My job is my identity; It's who I am. It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot.",64,29562
29562,6,23,Robin ,I-I don't understand. Why would he fire you?,65,29563
29563,6,23,Barney ,I don't understand. Why would you fire me?,66,29564
29564,6,23,Arthur ,Have you already forgotten how Mosby got that job?,67,29565
29565,6,23,Barney ,By being the best architect available?,68,29566
29566,6,23,Arthur ,No.,69,29567
29567,6,23,Barney ,By... being Latino?,70,29568
29568,6,23,Arthur ,No. Let me refresh your memory. We were in this very room.,71,29569
29569,6,23,Barney ,"Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, fire me.",72,29570
29570,6,23,Barney ,Damn it! I was kidding?,73,29571
29571,6,23,Barney ,"I'm not kidding! Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife?",74,29572
29572,6,23,Arthur ,"Really good. In fact, I just put all my assets in her name. Smartest thing I've ever done.",75,29573
29573,6,23,Both ,Damn it!,76,29574
29574,6,23,Arthur ,"No, you'd better make sure Mosby doesn't screw up tomorrow. Because either that building is going down, or you're going down.",77,29575
29575,6,23,Ted ,They're going to fire him? That sucks. He loves that job.,78,29576
29576,6,23,Marshall ,And he's been doing it for years.,79,29577
29577,6,23,Lily ,"Okay, what does Barney do at GNB?",80,29578
29578,6,23,Ted ,No idea.,81,29579
29579,6,23,Marshall ,He has a lot of keys.,82,29580
29580,6,23,Robin ,"Okay, Ted, can you just please think about this before you...",83,29581
29581,6,23,Ted ,There's nothing to think about. I-I can't lose Zoey. That's the only thing that matters to me right now.,84,29582
29582,6,23,Robin ,"Okay, Ted... you know I love Zoey. But, look, sometimes... I go play chess in the park. And the key to chess... Okay, I play online. But the key to chess... Okay, it's Angry Birds! But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario.",85,29583
29583,6,23,Robin ,The chairman asks you...,86,29584
29584,6,23,Chairman ,Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?,87,29585
29585,6,23,Robin ,You say...,88,29586
29586,6,23,Ted ,No.,89,29587
29587,6,23,Robin ,And Zoey dumps you on the spot.,90,29588
29588,6,23,Zoey ,We're done here.,91,29589
29589,6,23,Robin ,There's the second scenario.,92,29590
29590,6,23,Robin ,The chairman asks you...,93,29591
29591,6,23,Chairman ,Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?,94,29592
29592,6,23,Robin ,You say...,95,29593
29593,6,23,Ted ,Yes,96,29594
29594,6,23,Robin ,"And you're happy for, like, a second, until you realize the building you helped save has just become a monument to everything this woman made you give up, and you resent her for it, so much so, in fact, that you dump her.",97,29595
29595,6,23,Ted ,We're done here.,98,29596
29596,6,23,Ted ,You said there was a third scenario.,99,29597
29597,6,23,Robin ,Right.,100,29598
29598,6,23,Robin ,The chairman asks you...,101,29599
29599,6,23,Chairman ,Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?,102,29600
29600,6,23,Robin ,But before you can answer...You're hit in the neck with a blow dart fired by the ninja Zoey's ex-husband hired to assassinate you.,103,29601
29601,6,23,Robin ,That one's less likely. What I'm saying... what I hate saying... is this. You and Zoey are gonna break up. But you can still save your career and Barney's.,104,29602
29602,6,23,Ted ,"Okay, first of all, no ninja's getting a jump on me. I have the reflexes of a jungle... (Robin slaps him by surprise)",105,29603
29603,6,23,Lily ,Tree?,106,29604
29604,6,23,Ted ,"Second of all, I don't care that the odds are stacked against us. I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey than spend the rest of my life alone playing Angry Birds, which, by the way, I've shown you how to download, like, 20 times.",107,29605
29605,6,23,Lily ,"I've got to say, I'm with Ted on this.",108,29606
29606,6,23,Ted ,Thank you.,109,29607
29607,6,23,Lily ,"I mean, yes, this is a huge, divisive issue for them. Which means no matter what happens, there's gonna be a lot of resentment. Probably lasting for years... infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship. So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this.",110,29608
29608,6,23,Robin ,Thank you.,111,29609
29609,6,23,,"Ted from 2030: That night, as I slept soundly...",112,29610
29610,6,23,Ted ,"Barney, what are you doing?",113,29611
29611,6,23,Ghost ,"Who is this Barney? My name is John Clifford Larrabee, architect of The Arcadian. And I am visiting you in a dream...",114,29612
29612,6,23,Ted ,Really? 'Cause it feels more like my insane friend renting a costume and breaking into my apartment in the middle of the night for what I wish I could say was the first time.,115,29613
29613,6,23,Ghost ,"Look, it's a dream, it is. So just... okay? Theodore... heed my words: do not try to save The Arcadian.",116,29614
29614,6,23,Ted ,"Barney, there's condoms in the drawer. Just take them and get out.",117,29615
29615,6,23,,"Ghost, shouting dramatically: I am not... Barney...",118,29616
29616,6,23,Ted ,Whoa! Lighting change!,119,29617
29617,6,23,Ghost ,"Theodore, you know The Arcadian is a badly built, architecturally unimportant rat's nest designed by an overpaid, plagiarizing ether addict with two thumbs. This guy.",120,29618
29618,6,23,Ted ,"Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building, but... does that mean we have to knock it down? I mean, it's not bothering anyone. Just anyone who lives in it... Or looks at it... Or smells it.",121,29619
29619,6,23,Ghost ,"New York is never finished, Theodore. She's a lady only a handful of architects ever get to dance with. Do not miss your turn.",122,29620
29620,6,23,Ted ,"The Arcadian has to go, doesn't it?",123,29621
29621,6,23,Ghost ,Indeed.,124,29622
29622,6,23,Ted ,You realize this kind of screws up my personal life.,125,29623
29623,6,23,Ghost ,"Mo' buildings, mo' problems.",126,29624
29624,6,23,Ted ,"This is a dream, right? Because, Barney, I swear to God, if that's you...",127,29625
29625,6,23,Ghost ,"Mommy's got Magic Lady Bits, Ted.",128,29626
29626,6,23,,"Ted, panting: Dream! Dream! It was just a dream. (He takes his breath again, then phones Zoey) Hey. I know it's late, but, uh... you want to meet up?",129,29627
29627,6,23,Zoey ,"Hello, Mr. Lion.",130,29628
29628,6,23,Ted ,"""Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair""""",131,29629
29629,6,23,Zoey ,"Hey, I met you right...(laughs)...here.",132,29630
29630,6,23,Ted ,Right. And I mistook you for a prostitute right... here.,133,29631
29631,6,23,Zoey ,"As far as you know, I still could be one. And you, my good man, have run up quite a tab.",134,29632
29632,6,23,Ted ,Worth every penny.,135,29633
29633,6,23,Zoey ,All right... this was fun. I'm gonna take this cab. Big day tomorrow. We need to get some sleep. And yet...,136,29634
29634,6,23,Ted ,"No, we should get some sleep. But this was fun.",137,29635
29635,6,23,Zoey ,Yeah. It's nice getting one last look to remember what we're trying to save.,138,29636
29636,6,23,Ted ,Exactly.,139,29637
29637,6,23,Zoey ,You okay?,140,29638
29638,6,23,Ted ,Yeah. Good night.,141,29639
29639,6,23,Chairman ,"Mr. Mosby, I'm going to ask you one last time. Should The Arcadian be a landmark?",142,29640
29640,6,23,Ted ,"No, it shouldn't be a landmark. There are a lot of important buildings in New York. The Arcadian isn't one of them.",143,29641
29641,6,23,Zoey ,"E-Excuse me, I have a question for Mr. Mosby. If he doesn't think The Arcadian's worth saving, then whose voice is this? (She plays a recorder)",144,29642
29642,6,23,,"Ted, on recorder: The Arcadian should be a landmark. It should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of... wieners and gonads.",145,29643
29643,6,23,Chairman ,"Is that your voice, Mr. Mosby?",146,29644
29644,6,23,Ted ,"Yeah, that's me.",147,29645
29645,6,23,Ted ,"This is a nightmare. I can't believe she kept that tape. The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow, and based on today...",148,29646
29646,6,23,Robin ,They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place.,149,29647
29647,6,23,Ted ,Yeah.,150,29648
29648,6,23,Barney ,"We'll end up out of a job, all thanks to some stupid, only sort of awesome lion head.",151,29649
29649,6,23,Marshall ,"Better get used to that lion head. As of tomorrow, it's gonna be there till the end of times. And all because of my sweet, sweet rhymes.",152,29650
29650,6,23,Ted ,What are we gonna do? We should buy a bar.,153,29651
29651,6,23,Barney ,We should totally buy a bar!,154,29652
29652,6,23,Marshall ,We should absolutely totally buy a bar!,155,29653
29653,6,23,Robin ,It's really the only sensible idea right now.,156,29654
29654,6,23,Marshall ,"Oh, oh, and ready? It's a theme bar. It's a courtroom.",157,29655
29655,6,23,Ted ,Yes! Where the bartenders wear sexy judges' robes.,158,29656
29656,6,23,Marshall ,I'll allow it!,159,29657
29657,6,23,Barney ,"The only court where you show up, then get served.",160,29658
29658,6,23,Robin ,Ho! You're judged by a jury of your beers.,161,29659
29659,6,23,Ted ,That's not bad.,162,29660
29660,6,23,Lily ,Just stop it! No one's buying a bar. Right now we have a little problem. Let's just think of a solution.,163,29661
29661,6,23,Ted ,"Lily, it's over. The good guys lost.",164,29662
29662,6,23,Marshall ,"I don't know, homegirl is pretty diabolical. If there is a plan that'll get us out of this, it's somewhere inside this butter churn. She'll think of it. I'm just gonna sit here... and watch it happen. (Lily starts to jiggle) And she's got it! Lily, what's the plan?",165,29663
29663,6,23,Barney ,"Oh, this ought to be good.",166,29664
29664,6,23,,Ted from 2030: And then Lily told us her plan.,167,29665
29665,6,23,Barney ,"Oh, this is good!",168,29666
29666,6,23,Ted ,We have to find Arthur right now.,169,29667
29667,6,23,Arthur ,"What is so difficult about this?! Tugboat figured this out in, like, five minutes. This is bush league!",170,29668
29668,6,23,Barney ,"Hey, Arthur!",171,29669
29669,6,23,Robin ,"Oh, cute dog!",172,29670
29670,6,23,Arthur ,"No! Tugboat, my other dog, that was a cute dog. This little disappointment is nothing but a cheap facsimile. I said it! Yeah, my love is reserved for dogs that go to the bathroom on command instead of wasting my time!",173,29671
29671,6,23,Barney ,"Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea for how we can save, not saving The Arcadian.",174,29672
29672,6,23,Arthur ,"Oh, his wife has an idea. Let me tell you about wives, okay? They leave you and take your best friend with them. You're not Tugboat! You'll never be Tugboat!",175,29673
29673,6,23,Barney ,"Uh... Hey, Arthur?",176,29674
29674,6,23,Arthur ,I guess this one's kind of cute or whatever. So... so what's the idea?,177,29675
29675,6,23,Lily ,"Okay, first hear my demands. One, Ted and Barney keep their jobs. Two, when you guys do finally blow up The Arcadian, one of them gets to push the button.",178,29676
29676,6,23,Barney and Ted, Dibs.,179,29677
29677,6,23,Arthur ,Fine! What's the idea?,180,29678
29678,6,23,Lily ,Well...,181,29679
29679,6,23,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, for legal reasons, I have to skip this part of the story and jump ahead to the next night, as the Landmarks Preservation Commission gave their verdict.",182,29680
29680,6,23,Chairman ,"Last night, this committee took a vote, and while we have all felt from the very beginning that The Arcadian is, well, an eyesore... Mr. Mosby's surprising testimony about the lion's head stonework left us no choice but to declare it... a landmark. But then, something else happened last night. That same lion's head stonework...disappeared. So... that makes our job a little easier. Motion denied.",183,29681
29681,6,23,Ted ,Zoey... Zoey!,184,29682
29682,6,23,Zoey ,"All right, what do you have to say for yourself?",185,29683
29683,6,23,Ted ,I don't know. Sometimes... things have to fall apart to make way for better things.,186,29684
29684,6,23,Zoey ,We're done here.,187,29685
29685,6,23,Ted ,"Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore. You may now say what you really think of Zoey.",188,29686
29686,6,23,Barney ,"I don't know, she may have been right about that lion's head. It gave The Arcadian a regal elegance. Then again, it goes really nice with my duvet. (He takes out a normal size screw driver) I hope I used the right screws.",189,29687
29687,6,24,,"Ted from 2030: Kids, in the spring of 2011, Zoey and I broke up. But the good news: Goliath National Bank was finally ready to demolish The Arcadian and build the new headquarters I'd designed for them. (A committee, including Ted holding a big pair of scissors, is standing behind a red ruban. Ted is going to cut it, when a very happy Barney arrives with a bigger pair of scissors and cut the ruban before Ted can) The only problem was... I kept butting heads with my project supervisor on one very important issue.",1,29688
29688,6,24,Ted ,I want to press the button to blow up The Arcadian!,2,29689
29689,6,24,Barney ,I want to press it!,3,29690
29690,6,24,Ted ,I want to press it!,4,29691
29691,6,24,Barney ,I want to press it!,5,29692
29692,6,24,Robin ,"Guys, I dated you both, and neither of you is good at pressing or even finding the button. After some awkward pawing around, that building's going to fake an implosion, say, ""Baby, that was great"""" and go to sleep.",6,29693

29694,6,24,Robin ,"It's just a button, okay? Can we just talk about something else, please?",8,29695
29695,6,24,Ted ,"Well, I ran into Zoey yesterday.",9,29696
29696,6,24,Robin ,That's the first time since the breakup. How's she doing?,10,29697
29697,6,24,Zoey ,"I'm still unemployed, so I had to get a couple roommates.",11,29698
29698,6,24,Ted ,Saving money. Making new friends. No downside.,12,29699
29699,6,24,Zoey ,"They're all 22 and sell drugs. Which means they're not taking them. So, that's a win.",13,29700
29700,6,24,Ted ,"Well, I can tell you're really busy so I should... I'll let you go.",14,29701
29701,6,24,Zoey ,Hey. You want to get coffee sometime?,15,29702
29702,6,24,Robin ,"You know that ""coffee"" is code for ""I want to get back together"" right?",16,29703
29703,6,24,Ted ,"Well, at first I wasn't sure, but then she said something that got me thinking.",17,29704
29704,6,24,Zoey ,I want to get back together.,18,29705
29705,6,24,Ted ,"Don't worry, we're not. I just, I feel bad Zoey's having such a hard time.",19,29706
29706,6,24,Barney ,"You know what might... make you feel better, buddy?",20,29707
29707,6,24,Ted ,I'm not letting you press the button.,21,29708
29708,6,24,Barney ,I want to press the button!,22,29709
29709,6,24,Ted ,You're not pressing the button! It's my button!,23,29710
29710,6,24,,"Ted from 2030: Sadly, that's all you need to know about my summer. Now, around this time, Uncle Marshall was still having a tough time finding a job.",24,29711
29711,6,24,Lily ,"He's out printing out a whole new batch of résumés because he misspelled the phrase ""detail-oriented."" And when he gets back home, he is going to find his favorite soup there waiting for him.",25,29712
29712,6,24,Robin ,"Oh, that's sweet, Lil, but didn't you guys get food poisoning here one time?",26,29713
29713,6,24,Lily ,"Three times. But they're really nice about it. Their policy is, ""Get sick, get a free gallon of soup"".",27,29714
29714,6,24,,"Ted from 2030: And so, Lily dropped off Marshall's surprise soup and headed back to work to introduce the new class pet.",28,29715
29715,6,24,Lily ,"This is Mr. Buttons 2. Now, after what happened to Mr. Buttons 1, we have to be very gentle with... (Lily throws up onto Mr. Buttons 2. She leaves the shool, running to her apartment in order to stop Marshall from eating the soup) Marshall! Don't eat the soup! Oh, thank God.",29,29716
29716,6,24,Marshall ,This was about to be my third bowl. Why shouldn't I eat the soup? Why shouldn't I eat the soup?,30,29717
29717,6,24,Robin ,"Hey, Mr. Architect, big day for you tomorrow, huh?",31,29718
29718,6,24,Barney ,Yeah. Getting to stand next to me while I press the button. That is going to be legend... wait for it...dary adjacent. Legendary adjacent!,32,29719
29719,6,24,Robin ,You okay?,33,29720
29720,6,24,Ted ,Yeah... no. This morning I was talking to the foreman.,34,29721
29721,6,24,Foreman ,"Hey, hotshot.",35,29722
29722,6,24,Ted ,"You know, Rod, um, I'm loving that nickname, and I can tell it's totally affectionate, but, uh, I'd prefer Ted.",36,29723
29723,6,24,Rod ,"Yeah, but you're such a hotshot, I figured I'd just call you hotshot. Pick one. And make sure you like it. There's going to be 50,000 of these in your big, hotshot building, hotshot.",37,29724
29724,6,24,Ted ,"50,000 lightbulbs! What if this one's too bright? What if this one flickers and gives everyone a weird headache? Do you know how many people it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs?",38,29725
29725,6,24,Barney ,"Are these people Irish, Polish, blondes... what are we dealing with here?",39,29726
29726,6,24,Ted ,There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks?,40,29727
29727,6,24,Barney ,Not possible. Your building is new. And I have one rule: New is always better.,41,29728
29728,6,24,Ted ,You can't keep saying you have one rule if they're always different rules.,42,29729
29729,6,24,Barney ,"Ah, but ""new is always better"" is my oldest rule, which makes it the best.",43,29730
29730,6,24,Ted ,"Hi, Marsh.",44,29731
29731,6,24,Barney ,"Oh, hey, buddy.",45,29732
29732,6,24,Robin ,Hey. Everything okay?,46,29733
29733,6,24,Marshall ,"Lily got food poisoning from some soup. And then I ate the soup exactly three hours later. Which means I can see exactly three hours into my future, and it... doesn't... look... good. I tried to be supportive.",47,29734
29734,6,24,Lily ,"Oh, baby, can you just hold me, please?",48,29735
29735,6,24,Marshall ,"Of course, baby. (He hesitates, then put one finger onto her back)",49,29736
29736,6,24,Marshall ,"But it doesn't help it that when Lily gets going; she sounds like a velociraptor from Jurassic Park. But then I realized a man can do a lot of living in three hours. So, I'm out experiencing this beautiful, crazy dance called life. Ah, my last meal. MacClaren's famous jalapeno poppers. My doctor says I need to eat healthier, so I figured the round-trip flight these babies are about to take will land them permanently on the no-fry list. Good-bye, my friend. It's been a hell of a ride. I have to...",50,29737
29737,6,24,Marshall ,"Hey, babe. The gang says feel better.",51,29738
29738,6,24,Lily ,"Mm. Thanks. Wait, you didn't tell them I had food poisoning, did you?",52,29739
29739,6,24,Marshall ,"Um, I...",53,29740
29740,6,24,Lily ,"Marshall, when it's stomach stuff, you just say ""under the weather,"" or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things.",54,29741
29741,6,24,Marshall ,I know. I just said that you had the sniffles. No one is picturing anything but little red-nosed you under a blankie with some hot tea.,55,29742
29742,6,24,Barney ,I wonder what end it's coming out of Lily right now.,56,29743
29743,6,24,Robin ,I bet it's her tushie.,57,29744
29744,6,24,Barney ,"I bet it's both. Hey, speaking of explosions... enough already, Ted! That button's mine!",58,29745
29745,6,24,,"Ted, while texting on his phone: Yeah, fine, okay.",59,29746
29746,6,24,Barney ,"I got you this job, so I... Say what?",60,29747
29747,6,24,Ted ,Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run. (Ted leaves the Bar),61,29748
29748,6,24,Barney ,You...,62,29749
29749,6,24,,"Marshall, picking up his phone: Hello?... Yes, it is. (To Lily) It's Bloom, Greenberg and Associates. They want me to come interview. (Lily throws up) I know it's risky to go, but this is the best environmental law firm in New York. It's my dream job. (Lily throws up) That's a great idea, babe. I'll ask them. (In his phone) Hey, is it at all possible, could I come in on Monday?... Okay, I'll, I'll see you at 5:00. (Marshall hangs up) Thank you. I love and believe in you, too, baby.",63,29750
29750,6,24,Robin ,"Why would Ted just give up the button like that? And he forgot his phone. ""See you in an hour.""",64,29751
29751,6,24,Barney ,Who's that from?,65,29752
29752,6,24,Robin ,Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her!,66,29753
29753,6,24,Barney ,Why would Ted get back together with Zoey? He's doing great.,67,29754
29754,6,24,Robin ,"After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back.",68,29755
29755,6,24,Barney ,"No, I refuse to believe that Ted is getting back with Zoey because of lightbulbs.",69,29756
29756,6,24,Robin ,"Uh, Ted's gone back for less.",70,29757
29757,6,24,Ted ,"Hi, Natalie. You want to get coffee sometime?",71,29758
29758,6,24,Ted ,Bro.,72,29759
29759,6,24,Barney ,"Ted, I only have one rule.",73,29760

29762,6,24,Ted ,"Robin, you want to get coffee sometime...?",76,29763
29763,6,24,Robin ,"Get it together, bro.",77,29764
29764,6,24,Marshall ,"According to my calculations, at 6:00 p.m., my body is gonna pay out like the most disgusting slot machine in the world. That gives me two hours to go do the interview and still get back in time.",78,29765
29765,6,24,Lily ,"Oh, but, baby, what if you hit the jackpot early?",79,29766
29766,6,24,Marshall ,Don't worry. I'll be prepared.,80,29767
29767,6,24,Neighbor ,"I'm talking your ear off, sorry. Is there anything I can do for you, sweetie?",81,29768
29768,6,24,Marshall ,Can... I... borrow... an adult diaper?,82,29769
29769,6,24,Barney ,We've got to stop Ted. Where are they meeting?,83,29770
29770,6,24,Robin ,"Okay, Zoey wrote, ""Meet me at 6:00, where it all began, where you gave me the orchid at the intersection.""",84,29771
29771,6,24,Barney ,"Well, that's good. All we have to do is think back to the time Ted told us about his first date with Zoey.",85,29772
29772,6,24,Ted ,Amazing first date with Zoey! We met at the intersection... (The rest is unintelligible),86,29773
29773,6,24,Robin ,"Aw, that's sweet.",87,29774
29774,6,24,Barney ,You weren't listening either?,88,29775
29775,6,24,Robin ,"I was in a coma. I mean, who pays attention to that sappy romantic crap?",89,29776
29776,6,24,Barney and Robin, Lily!,90,29777
29777,6,24,Lily ,"Yeah, I wasn't listening, either. Ted really can go on about a bitch.",91,29778
29778,6,24,Robin ,Great. He could be anywhere. We're flat out of clues.,92,29779
29779,6,24,Lily ,"Hey, wait. Ted left a message. I could hear it 'cause I was in the bathroom... blowing my nose... I have the sniffles.",93,29780
29780,6,24,Ted's voice," Hey, Lily, hope you're feeling better. Marshall told us you're exploding from both ends like a busted fire hydrant.",94,29781
29781,6,24,Lily ,"Damn it, Marshall.",95,29782
29782,6,24,Ted's voice," Anyway, listen, I was going to get back together with Zoey today, but I came to my senses on the way out here, so... False alarm... Oh, crap. Just stepped in some gum. I'm getting back together with Zoey!",96,29783
29783,6,24,Robin ,"Okay, we're never gonna find him.",97,29784
29784,6,24,Lily ,"Wait, wait, wait. That's was a subway announcement in the background. I speak conductor.",98,29785
29785,6,24,voice ,"Hey, Lily, hope you're feeling better. Marshall told us...",99,29786
29786,6,24,Lily ,Got it. Ted's at... (Lily runs to the bathroom and throws up) Oh... Ted's at Smith and Ninth Street.,100,29787
29787,6,24,Barney ,That's the intersection.,101,29788
29788,6,24,Robin ,That's in Brooklyn. How are we ever gonna get there in time?,102,29789
29789,6,24,Barney ,Way ahead of ya.,103,29790
29790,6,24,Ranjit ,Hello!,104,29791
29791,6,24,Man ,Marshall. Jake Bloom. Great to meet you.,105,29792
29792,6,24,Marshall ,"Hello, hi.",106,29793
29793,6,24,Jake ,"Hey. Oh, I'm sorry about the stench. We're suing a factory that's been dumping raw sewage into a local marshland. Yeah, ten minutes ago, I was knee-deep in liquefied human feces. And that was just on the F train.",107,29794
29794,6,24,Robin ,I can't believe Ted's getting back together with Zoey.,108,29795
29795,6,24,Barney ,I know. They're a total train wreck.,109,29796
29796,6,24,Robin ,Unmitigated disaster.,110,29797
29797,6,24,Ranjit ,Worst couple ever.,111,29798
29798,6,24,Barney ,"Yeah, almost as bad as us.",112,29799
29799,6,24,Robin ,"We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched.",113,29800
29800,6,24,Barney ,"What about me? I got so fat, at the end of a date, you'd unhook my bra.",114,29801
29801,6,24,Robin ,You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated.,115,29802
29802,6,24,Barney ,"Thank God we're not sentimental saps who panic and get back together. Seriously, why would people do that?",116,29803
29803,6,24,Robin ,I guess I get it.,117,29804
29804,6,24,Barney ,What do you mean?,118,29805
29805,6,24,Robin ,"Well, no matter how bad things got... Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he?",119,29806

29809,6,24,Jake ,"So, let me show you some of the gut-wrenching environmental atrocities that we were working to stop, okay? Here, pop quiz. What is that?",123,29810
29810,6,24,Marshall ,That's a seal.,124,29811
29811,6,24,Jake ,"Bingo! Yes, a bloated seal corpse rotting in industrial waste.",125,29812
29812,6,24,Marshall ,Mm-hmm.,126,29813
29813,6,24,Jake ,"Now, wait till you see what we found when we cut him open.",127,29814
29814,6,24,Robin ,"Okay, where the hell are they?",128,29815
29815,6,24,Barney ,Maybe this isn't the intersection.,129,29816
29816,6,24,Robin ,"Well, maybe it is and we're too late. Man, I wish we'd gone to Brooklyn sooner.",130,29817
29817,6,24,Man ,"I know, right? Ever since the Trader Joe's opened up, Brooklyn is so... whatever.",131,29818
29818,6,24,Robin ,"Wait. Where'd you get that? (The guy is holding a cup, on which is printed ""The Intersection"")",132,29819

29820,6,24,Barney ,She's alone! There's still time! But where the hell is Ted?,134,29821
29821,6,24,Robin ,"Wait a minute. On their first date, he brought her an orchid. How much do you want to bet he's gonna do it again?",135,29822
29822,6,24,Barney ,"Brilliant. But wait, he had a huge head start on us. There's no way he's still in there unless he spent a half an hour picking out the perfect orchid.",136,29823
29823,6,24,,"Ted, leaving the florist's shop: Thanks, Julia! You know what? Let me see the pink lady slipper again. (He goes back inside)",137,29824
29824,6,24,Jake ,"Now, do you know what that is?",138,29825
29825,6,24,Marshall ,A pile of rotting seagull carcasses covered in toxic sludge.,139,29826
29826,6,24,Jake ,"Being eaten by rats. Exactly. Now this next slide... Oh, I'm sorry. That's my wife's water birth. I don't know how that got in there. Anyway, that's all my questions.",140,29827
29827,6,24,,"Marshall, thinking: Oh, my God, I made it! Now just shake his hand, clench your very soul and run like hell!",141,29828
29828,6,24,Jake ,"Now, I like to set aside 20 minutes at the end of every interview for your questions. So don't hold back. Whatever you got inside there, you just let 'er rip.",142,29829
29829,6,24,,"Marshall, thinking: I can't do this anymore. I'm just gonna tell him the truth.",143,29830

29833,6,24,Ted ,"Thanks, Julia! No, on second thought. (Barney and Robin jumps on him, all three fall down)Ooh! Come on. What the hell?!",147,29834
29834,6,24,Robin ,You can't get back together with Zoey just because you're freaking out over a lightbulb.,148,29835
29835,6,24,Ted ,"I'm not freaking out over a lightbulb! I'm freaking out over 50,000 lightbulbs! I can't do this! I only got this job because you gave it to me, Barney. I didn't earn it!",149,29836
29836,6,24,Robin ,"Look, Ted, the future is scary. But you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar. Yes, it's tempting.",150,29837
29837,6,24,Barney ,But... it's a mistake.,151,29838
29838,6,24,Ted ,"You're right. (Ted stops an elderly woman who was about to enter the Intersection) Um, excuse me. Can you give this to the blonde sitting alone in there and tell her Ted's really sorry? Also... indirect sunlight. Don't overwater. Half a cup a week is more than enough.

29841,6,24,Marshall ,"Lily, this year, this nasty schoolyard bully of a year will not stop punching me in the face. How did we kick off 2011? My dad died. And now after five months of unemployment, I just blew my dream job.

29842,6,24,Lily ,"Baby, come here.",156,29843
29843,6,24,Marshall ,I just want to shut my eyes for a few seconds before it starts. (He lyes down onto the bed and falls asleep),157,29844
